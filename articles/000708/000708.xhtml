                     quantitative analyses by digital means. In this instance, we are dealing with
                     approximately 10,000 legal cases from the Special Court Munich throughout the entire
                     period of the National Socialist regime in Germany (1933–1945) which were thoroughly
                     documented in a printed format as “Archive Inventory” in
                     the 1970s [<a class="ref" href="#baystmuk19751977">BayStMUK 1975–1977</a>]. While the original court files are
                     heterogeneous in their structure and comprise all kinds of documents, from
                     handwritten notes to typewritten forms, and therefore are not predestined for a
                     systematic and automated approach in extrapolating the content, the documentation
                     done in the 1970s, the “Archive Inventory”, presents us
                     with a semi-structured repository of knowledge that can be analysed by digital
                     methods. First steps towards such were set about recently [<a class="ref" href="#gerstmeier2022">Gerstmeier et al. 2022</a>]. For further analyses, we have to pre-process the
                     semi-structured data from the “Archive Inventory” – i.e.,
                     categorisation in the form of organising the information contained within the source

                     social status, accusation, and sentencing level are to be sought as well as general
                     patterns. Overall, this serves the objective of describing the legal norm (or
                     “average” practice) and at the same time uncovering anomalies (cf. [<a class="ref" href="#schlumbohm_gribaudi1998">Schlumbohm and Gribaudi 1998</a>, p. 28]. We are discussing the following
                     six theoretical considerations:</div>

                        <li class="item">Categorisation moves between macro- and microhistorical approaches. Such a path
                           to a comprehensive macrohistorical study contrasts with smaller-scale
                           microhistory, for which studies based on few samples of single records already
                           exist. For computer-assisted macrohistorical research, corresponding digital tools
                           are being developed under the metaphor of “macroscopy”
                           [<a class="ref" href="#graham_milligan_weingart2016">Graham, Milligan, and Weingart 2016</a>]. However, this research approach
                           generally still awaits a theoretical foundation. When Jürgen Schlumbohm [<a class="ref" href="#schlumbohm_gribaudi1998">Schlumbohm and Gribaudi 1998</a>, p. 29] discussed whether micro- and
                           macrohistory are to be understood as complementary or incommensurable, he
                           concluded with regard to the aggregation of data following categorisation that
                           “a kind of ‘theory of aggregation’” does not
                           yet exist for historical science. This still seems to be true, and the resulting
                           desideratum needs to be addressed. This is not only the case because of the
                           increase of data-driven research also in “traditional” Humanities disciplines
                           such as History, but especially because a sharp division (in the understanding of
                           a counterpart) between macro and micro studies seems to be as outdated as the
                           rigid adherence to disciplinary boundaries. However, just as there might be no
                           interdisciplinarity without disciplines, the interchange between macro and micro
                           studies should not lead to the abandonment of the cores of the respective research
                           paradigm, but rather form a smooth transition. It is here that categorisation or
                           general modelling forms an important bridge between the study of the particular at
                           the micro level and that of the general at the macro level — from the close-up
                           view to the distant view and back again. Such bridge-building, however, must be
                           purposeful as well as systematic and shall not result in eclectic bricolage and
                           thus arbitrariness.</li>
                        <li class="item">Categorisation is data modelling. All categorisation is modelling and the
                           models we create help “understanding the world by means of
                           patterns and principles”
                           [<a class="ref" href="#bod2018">Bod 2018</a>, p. 78] in the sense of the macrohistory we seek.
                           Hence, general model theory applies to categorisation. Among other things, this
                           means that categorisations are reasoned (and subjective) selection processes. This
                           is of considerable methodological importance for any data-driven work, especially
                           in the Digital Humanities, but is apparently too often neglected, which
                           significantly diminishes the value of the results. Categorisations are conscious
                           typifications or exemplifications and must be demarcated not only from
                           arbitrariness but also from unconscious formation of stereotypes (cf. [<a class="ref" href="#ginzburg_poni1991">Ginzburg and Poni 1991</a>]).</li>
                        <li class="item">Categorisation is complexity reduction. This, too, forms an area of tension
                           between micro- and macrohistory. In the context of methodological approaches of
                           the Digital Humanities, reference could be made here to procedures of close and
                           distant reading. In close reading, the human researcher processes significantly
                           more information from each source but fewer sources, whereas, in distant reading,
                           significantly more sources are condensed into less information. In our case, for
                           example, microhistory corresponds to the close reading of complete, more
                           substantial, but only few sample records, while the macrohistorical approach
                           corresponds to the distant reading of aggregated data. In such a reduction of
                           complexity, it has to be weighed up how much of the source content has to be taken
                           over 1:1 and how much may be typified. The higher the degree of abstraction, the
                           greater the danger of losing relevant content without achieving any more
                           selectivity. This is a problem we have encountered especially in the pragmatic
                           approach below. In the case of the Special Courts, reducing potentially
                           substantial sources (“<span class="foreign i">Akte</span>”/file) to a few
                           data (“<span class="foreign i">Aktenregest</span>”/record), which are then
                           additionally aggregated into categories, could be considered typical for
                           macro-historical questions based on secondary data from “upcycling”
                           processes.</li>
                        <li class="item">Categorisation of historical data means dealing with time. The period of
                           validity of categories is often limited, which becomes especially evident over the
                           transition from pre-modern to modern times (“<span class="foreign i">Sattelzeit</span>”) but should be seen as a fundamental challenge of
                           historical macro studies in general. Here we usually have two levels to consider:
                           first, the present time from which we write history, and second, the past about
                           which we write, whose sources we use, and whose terminology we rely on. In the
                           case discussed here, there is even a third temporal level, namely the indexing of
                           the files carried out in the 1970s and the vocabulary used there to produce the
                           “Archive Inventories”. This results in the challenge
                           to do justice – as far as possible – to the conceptuality and the vocabulary of
                           the source while at the same time creating a valid categorisation over different
                           temporal levels and evaluating it critically (cf. [<a class="ref" href="#seiffert2006">Seiffert 2006</a>, p. 205]; [<a class="ref" href="#wehler1972">Wehler 1972</a>, p. 20].</li>
                        <li class="item">Categorisation is hermeneutical and ontological. It has already been described
                           in the literature that there is a tense but also distinctly appealing relationship
                           between source vocabulary and modern typology. In addition, in our case it is
                           especially important not to fall for the Nazi ideology and the language they used
                           (cf. [<a class="ref" href="#klemperer1947">Klemperer 1947/2020</a>]), which often stands in contrast to actually
                           valid law (of the Weimar Republic), to a modern understanding of law, and to human
                           rights, which are considered universal today. The question of universals alluded
                           to here is also of fundamental importance for categorisation. Seiffert [<a class="ref" href="#seiffert2006">Seiffert 2006</a>, p. 159] distinguishes between “source terms”, “modern terms”,
                           and “supra-temporal terms”. Certain terms, he claims
                           are “timeless”, such as the category “human being,” and thus “so general and
                           formal that we can unhesitatingly apply them to any historical epoch without
                           fear of doing violence to the historical fact”. It is essential to keep
                           this ontological dimension in mind when categorising. In the three approaches we
                           have followed, especially the inductive-computational (automated) one attempts a
                           clustering via the source terms (of the secondary source). It takes the finding of
                           the source terms without further interpretation as its basis of categorisation,
                           while the first two approaches interpretively process a priori or inductive
                           theoretical presuppositions. But here, too, the question remains: is this
                           interpretation present-tense, is it situated within the hermeneutically
                           understanding of the past under investigation, or can it be supra-temporal?</li>
                        <li class="item">Categorisation has a normative function. Directly linked to these
                           considerations is the question of whether a categorisation is descriptive or
                           normative: does it describe (ontologically: “A is an X”) or does it norm
                           (“shall A be an X”, “shall A be understood as an X”)? A source
                           approach is arguably more descriptive, while the use of modern terms tends toward
                           a normative view. Thus, categorisation, like any kind of norm-setting, runs the

                           research: Whoever prescribes the data categories sets norms. Therefore, given
                           categories must always be critically questioned, which is especially important
                           when “upcycling” older data. This also applies to primary data (take Census

                           which admittedly was also practised under Nazi rule, but not only there, see e.g.,
                           race laws). Such categorisations can then have an impact on the formation of

                     because of this, the contents of the cases are particularly diverse and hard to grasp

                     1975 and 1977, is in itself remarkable in several respects. It was printed in a
                     limited quantity of copies, self-published in off-set technology, bound off-site and
                     not distributed on the book market, but given away to libraries and archives. The
                     resulting volumes are thus rather to be understood as “grey literature”, as
                     auxiliary means for the internal use of authorities and for scientific purposes. They
                     are not only a finding aid but a possible answer to the challenge of indexing mass

                     of

                     process, the editors decided to define a standardised set of general characteristics
                     to be collected for each case. That this standardisation changed over the
                     long-stretched process of compilation is only natural, e.g., for cases from 1939

                     digital transformation. Because the corresponding primary sources, i.e., case files,
                     have been analysed only partly, the inventory still retains great relevance for
                     research today. The main aim lies in digitally upcycling the inventory in order to
                     make the records available and pre-process the data for quantitative analyses, e. g.,
                     correspondence analysis for which well-designed categorisation is essential. After
                     digitisation and pre-processing, information extraction from the machine-readable
                     text is possible through its formalised structure. The compilatory work done in the
                     1970s has been meticulous and offers access to the content on a systematic level.
                     Nonetheless, close reading raises questions about how the editors structured their
                     approach. There also seems to be some inconsistency in how the information was
                     processed (e.g., the wording of the charges laid against the defendants). Those
                     inconsistencies pose a challenge for the digital upcycling in the sense of automated
                     processes taking, for example, the extraction of accusation categories: For further
                     large-scale analysis, cases on derogatory or critical remarks – by far the largest
                     group of charges – belong in the same category, whether they may refer to the
                     spreading of rumours (on Hitler or otherwise) or rants about the regime in general.
                     Those cases are to be differentiated from crimes still liable to prosecution today,

                     Compared to plain text, hOCR has the added advantage of preserving layout
                     information. Each page contained several inventory records, with entries sometimes
                     spanning two pages, when starting close to the bottom of a page. We continued
                     processing the text programmatically by undoing the physical boundaries at page-level
                     and, instead, splitting the text at logical boundaries, namely at the inventory
                     record level. Out of 9,955 inventory records, 8,531 or 86 % could be extracted
                     successfully [2]. With separate inventory records in plain text format, our algorithm
                     continued to parse and translate each entry into JSON format [3]. Each JSON record
                     captures meta information, such as page number and name of the hOCR file containing
                     the record, and the content of the inventory record itself in separate fields, as

                     text within each JSON record, to maintain the opportunity to make (manual)

                        legal theoretical distinction between the positive law [<a class="ref" href="#kelsen2017">Kelsen 2017</a>]
                        and laws and legal regulations, respectively, in the sense of Carl Schmitt’s [<a class="ref" href="#schmitt1922">Schmitt 1922/2021</a>] and other NS legal thinkers’ theory of law and society.
                        It marks the peculiarity of NS Special Courts within the contemporary judicial
                        system of the Reich that in the same way of their institutionalisation beyond the
                        regular courts, the NS regime began with its legislation of special penal
                        regulations besides the regular criminal laws that had been systematically
                        codified in the German Nation State since 1871 [<a class="ref" href="#rstgb1871">RStGB 1871, 1935</a>]. The
                        proceedings before the Special Courts concerned first of all exclusively such
                        “crimes”, or – to be more semantically neutral – actions that only had
                        been criminalised by a certain kind of NS special penal regulations. A closer look
                        on the complex process of the Nazi Seizure of Power shows that the NS regime
                        relaunched special penal legislation even before relaunching the Weimar-invented
                        Special Courts [<a class="ref" href="#verordnung1933">Verordnung 1933</a>], at first by means of the “Reichstag Fire Decree”

                        [<a class="ref" href="#bracher1960">Bracher 1960</a>, p. 82] shows the principal significance of this

                        the NS system of persecution and repression, Special Courts were increasingly used
                        for “regular crimes”. The longer the NS regime lasted, the more frequent such
                        cases were brought before it. This phenomenon is well known by existing research
                        literature (e.g., [<a class="ref" href="#doerner1998">Dörner 1998</a>, pp. 36–39]; [<a class="ref" href="#wogersien2007">Wogersien 2007</a>]). Apart from a few exceptions (e.g., [<a class="ref" href="#graczyk2021">Graczyk 2021</a>, pp. 250–330]), concrete numbers or data on this
                        topic have not been presented yet. The Mannheim Special Court shows, for example:
                        In 1933 18.6 % of “regular” first instance judgements (like theft or murder)
                        were tried before it, but in 1943 this percentage would increase up to 43.9 % [<a class="ref" href="#oehler1997">Oehler 1997</a>, pp. 36–37]. Precise statistical analyses on the

                        applied represent a desideratum. By the example of Special Court Munich, this can
                        be approached through our computer-based investigation of its archive inventory
                        from the 1970s (cf. section below). Besides the codified law, Munich Special Court
                        even applied rather marginal regulations and decrees of regular penal law for its
                        judgements, up to the late Weimar “Animal Protection

                        special judiciary. Already since 1938, a veritable boost of new specific NS
                        special penal law regulations began to unfold. This “second wave” of NS
                        special criminal law-making is correlating with the sheer increase in the number
                        of cases brought to trial before, e.g., the Munich Special Court since 1939:
                        Between 1933 and 1938, 3,123 proceedings were carried out, but in the years
                        1939–1945 they reached 6,823. This tremendously increasing repression no longer
                        exclusively referred to the regime’s “own” German “<span class="foreign i">Volksgemeinschaft</span>” but to foreigners (mostly forced labourers

                        particularly since Germany’s war of aggression. This justifies the formation of
                        another deductive-legal-historical category, especially since these new products

                        deductive categorisation along the concrete legal bases of proceedings may provide

                        in a diachronic perspective. As far as the legal bases of the Munich Special Court
                        during World War II are concerned, we are dealing with a simultaneous set of legal
                        sources that arose at different times and, according to legal theory, are to be
                        evaluated differently. This multimodality of legal bases, some of which are
                        applied simultaneously in proceedings, is to be modelled in categories D-5, D-6,
                        and D-7 (concrete numbers cf. below, “Comparison” and
                        Figure 5). Especially since 1939, Munich Special Court often would apply D-2 legal
                        bases – above all paragraphs of the RStGB [<a class="ref" href="#rstgb1871">RStGB 1871, 1935</a>] – in addition
                        to the D-3 NS special penal law regulations whenever possible. Also, the “<span class="foreign i">Heimtückegesetz</span>” (1934)
                        of D-1 would still be applied extensively in addition to the new special penal law
                        regulations from 1938 onwards; even the “Reichstag Fire
                        Decree” (1933), still kept being applied by the Munich Special Court,
                        even in times of “total war” (17 times, remarkably in most cases against

                        of a state of injustice. The problem lies rather in the fact that in our research
                        we do not work primarily on the basis of the court records themselves but with the
                        help of secondary records prepared in the 1970s (cf. above, introduction to the
                        source material). As is the case with many digital humanities projects today, the
                        editors of the “pre-digital” database of the BayStMUK-“Archive Inventory” changed their metadata scheme in the course of data
                        entry. Thus, it happens that the laws/ordinances/legal paragraphs that had been
                        applied by the NS Special Court were only recorded in the inventory records from
                        the beginning of Part 3 (1939) onwards during the scientific retrospective of the
                        1970s [<a class="ref" href="#baystmuk19751977">BayStMUK 1975–1977</a>, 1976, p. 619; 1977, p. 2349]. In the
                        records on the trials and discontinued proceedings of the years 1933–1938, no
                        legal basis is given in the records of the “Archive
                        Inventory” at all and for the phase from 1938 to 1945 are also some
                        instances where such explicit information is missing (specifically in 473 cases).
                        Nonetheless, even for the proceedings where the record entries offer no paragraph
                        in the “Archive Inventory”, the offence recorded in
                        each case can always be used to draw conclusions about an unambiguous criminal
                        offence and the applied written law (cf. below, comparison). For the research
                        design of our project, this means that a categorisation along the legal basis of
                        the special court proceedings actually only makes sense for the period from the
                        beginning of 1939 onwards, even though 6,830 of the entire 9,954 cases captured by
                        the “Archive Inventory” took place after the beginning

                        topics relevant to categorising the charges by applying an intuitive system. In
                        some cases, the demarcation was relatively easy: A huge part of the charges
                        concern negative remarks against the regime (e.g., the claim that the Reichstag
                        was set on fire by National Socialists) and leading figures thereof (e.g., the
                        allegation that Hitler and Göring are gay). Another very clear category deals with
                        social interactions with prisoners of war. Non-war-related inventory records
                        contain crimes from bodily harm, e.g., in the form of murder, to theft. Evaluating
                        the charge content showed that the wording used to describe the individual
                        accusations is in many cases standardised. This offered the possibility of sorting
                        the whole corpus with a few selected keywords per category – so our hypothesis. </div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p25">A first trial run of the approach – by defining eight categories, by analysing a
                        sample of 90 randomly chosen cases and looking for similarities in their content

                        4-war-related economic crimes, like illicit butchering, 5-interactions with
                        prisoners of war, 6-sophisticated regime critique, written and oral resistance,
                        7-conspiracy, like pamphlet distribution, 8-negative remarks) – revealed a
                        disproportional surplus with over 40 % of cases concerning negative remarks. To
                        cater for deeper statistical analysis in the future, differentiating within this

                        relationship between accusations, results, and socio-political backgrounds of the
                        accused. So, through a review and quality control loop, we decided to refine
                        categories, what they each comprise as well as which keywords to use. Thereby,
                        comparing the success and failure of predicted results from single keywords places

                        charge text. The number of keywords necessary per category varies. Through a
                        review loop for each, the most efficient and concise word variations were sought
                        and found. Working with a spreadsheet, the course of action was to test keyword
                        variations on the column with the normalised charge text before incorporating the
                        best version into a nested formula, i.e., the most efficient one in terms of the
                        number of cases that could be allocated without compromising the results for other
                        categories. In some cases, only parts of words and phrases were used in order to
                        incorporate as many different word and verb forms as possible without compromising
                        the results by accidentally returning cases dealing with wholly different content.
                        This process led to the following categories with the different topics included in

                              to separate cases of murder, manslaughter and other bodily injury offences from
                              those that were purely regime-related. A review loop revealed that many charges
                              deal with people accused of talking about how Hitler and other NS functionaries
                              should be murdered or otherwise harmed, but where no actual deed was done.
                              Additionally, the review process revealed that there were also many instances

                              number from all out of the categorisation process), overall, only 264 instances

                              for the most part, stays the same throughout all inventory records for the

                              toughest decisions in the process. In the end, mainly due to the extensive
                              review and quality control process, it seemed most prudent to aggregate
                              political and religious persecution (like members of the Communist Party and
                              Jehovah’s Witnesses) with instances where politically or religiously motivated

                              unauthorized ownership and/or wearing of NS-uniforms or badges were also put
                              here. But the main motivation behind this pretence of being part of or
                              supporting the regime was self-preservation, thus not being on the same
                              resistance level as the other entries within the category. Those keywords were
                              therefore relegated to category E-7 and also resulted in decimating the number
                              of relevant cases by approximately 200 till only 238 remained in category E-6. </li>

                        above), we first trained a doc2vec model [<a class="ref" href="#le_mikolov2014">Le and Mikolov 2014</a>] using the
                        gensim library for Python 3 [<a class="ref" href="#rehurek_petr2010">Rehurek and Petr 2010</a>]. The algorithm
                        defines an ample set of parameters, some of which have a strong influence on the
                        quality of the document embeddings produced. Our goal was to cluster similar
                        inventory records close together and far apart from non-similar ones. Finding the
                        right set of parameters requires trial and error: define a parameter
                        configuration, train a doc2vec model, obtain embeddings for all documents, and
                        evaluate the results visually. At this point, we would like to note that we added
                        a manual intervention: doc2vec does not solve a classification task (there is no
                        ground truth) but, instead, generates document embeddings. Thus, no metric exists
                        to assess the quality formally and automatically in terms of classification
                        accuracy of the embeddings produced. Therefore, we selected a doc2vec model
                        manually: we first computed embeddings for all documents and plotted them in 2D
                        space separately for each model; we then used visual inspection to select a model
                        that would generate a non-homogeneous distribution of documents with clear
                        clusters. Figure 2 exemplifies how we explored the parameter space to select a
                        model: each subplot represents a model trained with a distinct set of parameters
                        and shows the document embeddings generated by the model projected into 2D

                        five parameters with three possible values each would require 35 = 243 models to
                        be trained and assessed. To limit the number of parameter configurations and,
                        thus, the number of models to be trained, we relied on our expertise and followed
                        the advice given by Lau [<a class="ref" href="#lau_baldwin2016">Lau and Baldwin 2016</a>] on recommendations for
                        optimal doc2vec hyper-parameter settings. We then systematically explored the
                        parameter space, by first defining for each parameter a range of allowed values
                        and then iterating each possible combination of all parameters. For example, when
                        allowing a = {1, 2, 3} and b = {4, 5, 6}, we would obtain nine possible
                        combinations of a and b, namely {1, 4}, {1, 5}, … {3, 5}, {3, 6}. After training
                        only a small number of doc2vec models and inspecting the results visually, we were
                        able to identify some parameter values which would always produce insufficient
                        results, independently of all other parameters. For example, disabling negative
                        sampling or switching on hierarchical softmax would always produce a homogeneous
                        distribution of documents, without distinct clusters, which is undesirable for our
                        purpose. We excluded these parameters from the exploration by setting a fixed
                        value and shrinking the parameter space to explore by orders of magnitude.</div>

                     C-37, and C-38 combined show a similar composition of cases. Conformity in this
                     instance is predominantly owed to the wording used by the editors in the 1970s and
                     the clearly defined legal basis for prisoners of war-related crimes.</div>

                     concrete paragraphs of the “<span class="foreign i">Heimtückegesetz</span>” (§§1, 2, and 4), namely E-8 negative remarks

                     always against Jehovah’s Witnesses (known and listed in the records as <cite class="title italic">Ernste Bibelforscher</cite>). This shows the qualitatively, but
                     also quantitatively extremely large role that the “<span class="foreign i">Heimtückegesetz</span>” had for the juridical practice
                     of the Nazi special courts. Through the inductive-computational approach, we find
                     that this distinction is made even more clear in the category C-28.</div>

                     a more accurate picture of categorising them. Successful categorisation – not only
                     of

                     provides the basis for more far-reaching analyses. For example, it is planned to
                     conduct correspondence analyses on different aspects, like (in-)dependencies between
                     socio-demographic markers and charges as well as results. The workflow initially
                     adopted the terminology used in the 1970s which is essentially based on the source
                     terms and not yet on a controlled and reduced vocabulary. Since
                     statistical/quantitative in-depth analyses are not very fruitful when based on a
                     large number of source terms as they tend to be less significant and more confusing
                     in the (visual) representation, data has to be aggregated employing different kinds
                     of categories, for instance on questions of social status or professions. For this
                     paper, we focused on accusations. Yet, our considerations apply analogously to other
                     categories to be formed. The presented deliberations on categorisation are to be
                     understood in preparation for the upcoming historical investigation of the data with
                     the help of this kind of statistical method.</div>
