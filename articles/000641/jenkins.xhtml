                  <p>Podcasts exist as new form of digital media that is quickly growing in popularity
                     but remains understudied. This study explores Black podcasts’ potential contributions
                     to the Black public sphere through the analysis of 20 Black podcasts.  The study found
                     that Black podcasts are a space in which Black people participate in discourse that
                     seeks to build community and resist against hegemonic structures. This study contributes
                     to Black public sphere research and the digital humanities field by positioning Black
                     podcasts as a counter-public for Black people.</p>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">This study builds on the work of scholars – most notably, Dr. Sarah Florini and Dr.
                     Catherine Knight Steele — who critically examine Black voices in digital spaces in
                     order to understand how both networked and independent Black podcasts, a successor
                     of Black radio, shape discourse around a range of issues and events salient to the
                     Black diaspora. Berry describes podcasts as a “horizontal media form…producers are
                     consumers, consumers may become producers, and both can engage in conversations with
                     each other” [<a class="ref" href="#berry2006">Berry 2006</a>, 144]. Berry argues that podcasts are not merely a converged medium which incorporates
                     audio, web, and portable media devices, but podcasts are also a disruptive technology
                     displacing established assumptions about audience consumption and media production
                     and distribution.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">Using Black public sphere as an analytical tool, this study explores how podcasting
                     contributes to the Black digital public sphere by answering questions related to how
                     Black podcasters build community, perpetuate resistance, and contribute to Black critical
                     debate. The Black Public Sphere is a significant analytical framework used to identify
                     varying political positions and interrogate Black voices in digital spaces because
                     it is a critical site where democratic discourse takes place and emerging diasporic
                     social movements are envisioned [<a class="ref" href="#blackpub1995">Black Public Sphere Collective 1995</a>]. Black podcasts symbolize a digital space “in which intellectuals join with the energies
                     of the street, the school, the church, and the city to constitute a challenge to the
                     exclusionary violence of much public space in the United States” [<a class="ref" href="#blackpub1995">Black Public Sphere Collective 1995</a>, 2-3]. Analyzing podcasting as a critical media technology that fosters democratic debate
                     creates an opportunity to observe the importance of Black podcasts to the field of
                     digital humanities.</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">Why is podcasting a critical medium? Podcasting is significant to Black content creators
                     because it is a relatively cost-effective, user-generated medium with far reaching
                     implications for education, information gathering, and community building, especially
                     around topics that are salient to Black communities across the diaspora. Podcasts
                     also serve as a critical archive for digital humanists because podcasts have the potential
                     to become primary source documentation that centers the experiences and voices of
                     a range of Black people – Black podcasters are collectively memorializing significant
                     moments in Black culture. Historically, Black media have always been crucial for memorializing
                     and publicizing the Black experience in America – Black print news, Black magazines,
                     Black radio, and Black television have been critical in anchoring and fostering support
                     for a range of social justice movements and for telling stories where Black people
                     and their lives are centered [<a class="ref" href="#bacon2003">Bacon 2003</a>][<a class="ref" href="#danky2009">Dankey 2009</a>][<a class="ref" href="#fraser2016">Fraser 2016</a>][<a class="ref" href="#payton2012">Payton and Kvansy 2012</a>]. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">Therefore, the purpose of this research is to demonstrate the significance of Black
                     podcasting to both the Black diaspora and the digital humanities field. Attempting
                     to narrowly define what denotes a Black podcast, and therefore Blackness, could prove
                     to essentialize a vast and diverse group of people. In an effort not to do so, this
                     study only seeks to define what was deemed as a Black podcast for the purposes of
                     this research as opposed to providing a definitive definition for Black podcasts.
                     For this study, a Black podcast is one that features a Black host or majority of Black
                     hosts and centers Black people in the content it produces. Black podcasts have the
                     potential to disrupt the ways in which mainstream media set the agenda for the salience
                     of political topics. </div>

                     identified topics prevalent across the podcasts that indicate the different ways in
                     which these podcasts express the aforementioned themes, adding to the legacy of Black
                     media in their own unique ways.</div>

                     of controlling the presentation and dissemination of information [<a class="ref" href="#squires2002">Squires 2002</a>]. Although access to public arenas is technically guaranteed to all, “all will not necessarily be equal within those spaces” [<a class="ref" href="#squires2002">Squires 2002</a>, 450]. Unfortunately, groups oppressed by gender, race, ethnicity, sexual identity, disability,
                     and class are not able to enjoy the same access to media resources, and their views
                     and voices are not given the same legitimacy and presence in discursive activities
                     [<a class="ref" href="#squires2002">Squires 2002</a>, 450]. More specifically, the oppression of Black people created an economic disparity
                     and historically, this has impacted Black people’s access to the necessary capital
                     needed to create and maintain their own media [<a class="ref" href="#johnson1993">Johnson 1993-1994</a>][<a class="ref" href="#selmanearnest1985">Selman-Earnest 1985</a>].  Despite this, Squires supports the need for marginalized groups to have separate

                     viewpoint, it has not been as dedicated to providing nuanced analyses of the issues
                     related to marginalized groups. For marginalized groups, alternative media spaces
                     are part of a historical tradition that has been important to counterbalancing the
                     overwhelming silencing of Black voices and life experiences in traditional media formats

                     by Black people and support Black centered discourse, draws its historical connection

                     of Black voices within public discourse about the positioning and future of Black
                     people, not only in the United States, but also around the world. The <cite class="title italic">Freedom Journal</cite> proved to be an important space for Black content creators to publicize the plight
                     of Black people globally and encourage radical, emancipatory movements [<a class="ref" href="#bacon2003">Bacon 2003</a>][<a class="ref" href="#fraser2016">Fraser 2016</a>]. This set the stage for Black people to envision themselves as members of a larger
                     intra-racial community, which would later be solidified through technological advances
                     that resulted in Black radio and Black entertainment television.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p8">Black radio, like its press predecessor, provided a space for Black people to participate
                     in discourse about their experiences with oppression, and it created a means for community
                     building around a shared desire to mitigate their marginalization. Black radio proved
                     to be integral during the Civil Rights Movement as it was a space where Black people
                     were able to discuss their discrimination, and sometimes through coded messaging,
                     Black broadcasters were able to communicate meeting locations for political demonstrations

                     in what he coined as public spheres, or places frequented by the bourgeois (pubs,
                     restaurants, opera halls, etc.) to debate and come to a consensus about political
                     issues of the day [<a class="ref" href="#calhoun1992">Calhoun 1992</a>].  According to Fraser, the concept of the bourgeois public sphere is important to
                     the development of theory because it is a place designed to be critical of the dominant,
                     controlling group [<a class="ref" href="#fraser1992">Fraser 1992</a>]. However, Habermas’ original work did not account for the varied voices within society
                     [<a class="ref" href="#squires2002">Squires 2002</a>]. Though Habermas did attempt to rearticulate his original concept and eventually

                     nonbourgeois, competing public spheres” [<a class="ref" href="#fraser1992">Fraser 1992</a>, 115]. To address this gap, a group of Black scholars – The Black Public Sphere Collective
                     – began conceptualizing a Black public sphere in the mid-1990s. Based on the work
                     of the Black Public Sphere Collective, this research aims to identify Black Podcasts
                     as a counter public sphere whose significance lies in its potential to help construct

                     spaces, Black people, people of color, and allies debate and commiserate about a range

                     Really Simple Syndication (RSS) software in 2000 that allowed for the creation of
                     digital feeds that could push audio content to subscribers [<a class="ref" href="#bottomley2015">Bottomley 2015</a>]. Podcasting was largely considered to be niche until 2014 when what is referred to

                     cultural marker. Black podcasters use the medium to talk about news and information
                     that is not typically covered on mainstream media, and they do so in a style not used
                     in mainstream media — Black podcasters tend to embrace the use of African American
                     Vernacular English (AAVE) [<a class="ref" href="#florini2015">Florini 2015</a>]. “Signifyin’”, another sociolinguistic marker of the Black racial identity as described by Florini,
                     is a popular style of banter used by several Black podcasters [<a class="ref" href="#florini2014b">Florini 2014b</a>]. Signifyin’ describes the use of humor and sarcasm within cultural context, and it
                     requires the listener to possess certain cultural, historical, and political knowledge
                     to understand the resistance and double-consciousness embedded within the communication
                     style. The practice of signifyin’, historically, was used by Black communities as
                     a form of critique against the dominant group. Though Florini is specifically analyzing
                     communication practices of Black Twitter users, this sociolinguistic feature can also
                     be applied to Black podcasters, and this is demonstrated in the way many Black hosts
                     name their podcasts [<a class="ref" href="#florini2014b">Florini 2014b</a>]. As an example, the podcast,  <cite class="title italic">The Black Guy Who Tips</cite>, is sarcastically named as a means to resist the stereotype that Black people do

                     digital technologies to build mediated communities, contest their marginalization,
                     provide a counter-narrative to stereotypes, and assert a more nuanced perspective
                     on current issues facing Black communities globally. Similar to social media, podcasts
                     allow for the masses to navigate around more traditional media gatekeepers to produce

                     spaces (hobbies, regions, jobs) where Black people are under-represented. The fourth

                     podcasts in the “U-N-I-T-Y” section, concentrates on the ways that Black podcasters use their platform as a means
                     to connect with and address issues within their communities. The section title derives
                     its name from the 1993 Grammy award-winning rap song by mogul Queen Latifah, and this
                     classic rap song is about creating unity and strengthening the Black community. The

                     on a variety of identities related to gender, sexuality, class, and nationality. This
                     first topic refers to the intersecting identities embraced by the podcasts’ hosts
                     rather than the specific content produced in that there was such a broad range of
                     Black identities represented and acknowledged. As an example, <cite class="title italic">Jesus and Jollof</cite> is hosted by two Nigerian-American women who share their experiences of being the
                     children of immigrants into their conversations. One co-host, Yvonne Orji stated:</div>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                     <p class="ptext">If you’re listening and you are a child of immigrants, this is how we adopt people
                        pleasing. We've all been there when your mom is like, “ahh. I have to make a pot of stew for the meeting. I’m so tired I just worked 40 hours.
                        Oh, but if I don’t, if I don’t do it then they’ll say I’m a bad person” [<a class="ref" href="#orji2020">Orji and Ajayi 2020</a>, 8:50].</p>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p28">Within this conversation, the hosts are stating that there are some experiences and
                     sentiments that are distinct to Black immigrants that influence their actions and
                     feelings. Orji’s comments suggest that an urge to please others at the detriment to
                     oneself might be one result of those experiences.</div>

                     stemming from being in a Black mediated space, tend to embrace the use of AAVE [<a class="ref" href="#florini2015">Florini 2015</a>]. This was found to be the case for many of the podcasts in this study, however, shows
                     such as <cite class="title italic">Jesus and Jollof</cite>, <cite class="title italic">Black Gals Livin Podcast</cite> and <cite class="title italic">I Said What I Said</cite> expand that notion as all of the hosts of the included podcasts are not African American.
                     The latter two podcasts have hosts that reside in the United Kingdom and Nigeria,
                     respectively. It would be more appropriate to say that Black podcasters embrace their
                     own regional dialects and accents while speaking English that incorporates their varied
                     identities whether it consists of being American, British, Nigerian, etc. or a combination

                     content reflects that experience. On these shows, the hosts often insert perspectives
                     and experiences that those who are not members of the LGBTQIA community would likely
                     not share. For example, <cite class="title italic">Strange Fruit</cite> contained a conversation with Dr. Ibram X. Kendi that spoke to how society views
                     Black LGBTQIA people as inferior to Black, cisgender, heterosexual people, which impacts
                     their lived experiences. The show, by discussing a court case in which an employee’s
                     pay was allegedly cut once their employer found out he was gay, exampled that some

                     often be reflected in conversations, it is important that Black people are not confined
                     to this narrative. For example, a large part of <cite class="title italic">HIM.</cite>'s episode was a conversation on dating and the five love languages. It is important
                     that the hosts were free to have a general conversation on dating without it having
                     to be specifically about dating as a gay Black man.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p32">These diverse identities are important in that they help to showcase there are multiple
                     perspectives and experiences that encompass the Black experience, giving even more
                     credence to the adage that “we are not a monolith.” These podcasts prove that the Black experience is not just limited to straight, cisgender,
                     American men. These podcasts highlight the differing experiences inherent in the Black
                     identity, and this is an important factor to highlight in Black media. Black podcasts
                     make it much easier to expose these varied Black experiences to help combat the few
                     and often negative depictions of Black people in mainstream media [<a class="ref" href="#wilson2013">Wilson, Gutiérrez, and Chao 2013</a>]. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p33">Common across all the podcasts was a focus on “self” – self-healing, self-motivation, self-acceptance, self-love, self-employment, and
                     self-care. Although these can all have very different meanings and applications, a
                     common topic of the podcasts revolved around motivating listeners to look inward,
                     reflect and become attuned with one’s needs. Much of the focus on self was in response
                     to the trauma that structural oppression places upon Black people. This is especially
                     true for the messages of self-care, self-love and self-healing. The podcast hosts
                     and guests recognized that oppression inflicts a severe amount of trauma, both mental
                     and physical, upon Black people; Black podcasters advocate for their listeners to
                     take the time to care for themselves. Shelah Marie, the guest on <cite class="title italic">Dreams in Drive</cite>, a podcast focused on entrepreneurship and hosted by Rana Campbell, provided insights
                     on what led her to creating a healing space and stated that “women of color, and especially Black women, are tired of being told about themselves
                     by people who are not Black. We’re tired of being told how to heal by people who are
                     not sharing our same journey” [<a class="ref" href="#campbell2019">Campbell 2019</a>, 38:13].</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p34">Similarly, the podcasts also recognized that society’s negative depictions of Black
                     people can sometimes influence one’s own ideas about their Blackness, which is why
                     self-acceptance was also present. In relation to this, Bose Ogulu, the guest on <cite class="title italic">I Said What I Said</cite>, a podcast hosted by FK and Jollz, two Black millennial women living in Lagos, spoke
                     about being fortunate to grow up in a household that taught her about the harm to
                     global Black populations resulting from apartheid and colonization. As a result of
                     gaining this understanding at an early age, she “grew with the realization that I was Black. African. Umm, that wouldn’t change. So
                     part of being comfortable in your own skin is accepting and embracing yourself” [<a class="ref" href="#abudu2019">Abudu and Adeyeye 2019</a>, 1:03:03]. The guest goes on to speak about how part of being able to embrace her Blackness
                     is also tied to her ability to travel and engage with Black people in different countries
                     and recognize similarities in culture while understanding that the perceived divisions
                     among Black people were created by colonizers [<a class="ref" href="#abudu2019">Abudu and Adeyeye 2019</a>, 1:03:20].</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p35">In addition, some podcasts also pushed forth the idea of self-employment as a way
                     for Black people to take more control of their own lives and careers. Both the hosts,
                     Nubia Younge and Frantzces Lys, and guest, Sha’Cannon, on <cite class="title italic">Chronicles Abroad</cite>, a podcast dedicated to Black women living as expatriates, spoke at length about
                     the need to move away from working in the traditional corporate America structure
                     because of the stress it caused. Sha’Cannon spoke about having to deal with poor leadership,
                     office politics, working extra hours, and various other hurdles that prevent one being
                     able to enjoy their work. She proclaimed: </div>
                  
                  <blockquote>

                        me. You know. “Can I go away? Because you’re draining the shit out of me. Can I go recharge?” You know, once you get it approved and you go, you almost can’t enjoy the vacation,
                        because it’s short lived you know… by the time you really are into the vacation it’s
                        over and you’re damn near depressed because you have to do what? Go back to the traffic

                  <div class="ptext" id="p37">Something of important to note in these examples is that Black podcasts often encourage
                     Black people to reach out across the diaspora in order to gain a greater sense of

                     Several of these podcasts seem to recognize the damage that White supremacy has done
                     to Black people and view the Black diaspora as a restorative resource.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p46">Ever present within many of the podcasts was a sense of resistance, both directly
                     and indirectly. All of the prior topics can be viewed as acts of resistance in their
                     own way and all of the observed episodes held some resistance to structural oppression
                     to varying degrees. Some shows such as <cite class="title italic">Tea with Queen and J</cite> are direct about it; in their introduction, they state their intent to dismantle
                     “White supremacist patriarchal capitalism” [<a class="ref" href="#muhammad2020">Muhammad and Francis 2020</a>]. While some of the other podcasts might not state it as blatantly, their actions
                     push against the status quo. For example, the guest on <cite class="title italic">Chronicles Abroad</cite> spoke at length about self-employment and moving further away from the stress and
                     constraints that corporate America creates [<a class="ref" href="#younge2020">Younge 2020</a>, 03:15]. Myliek Teele, founder and owner of a popular subscription service that features
                     Black beauty products, encourages her show’s listeners to “make sure that you’re putting the same energy and effort into your personal life as
                     you are into your professional life” [<a class="ref" href="#teele2019">Teele 2019</a>, 19:16]. For Black women, who are often taught to put everyone before their own needs, this
                     serves as a means of resistance. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p47">As most of the podcast hosts identify as women and/or queer, much of the conversations
                     also included resistance against sexism, transphobia, homophobia and other intersecting
                     points of oppression. For example, on <cite class="title italic">Strange Fruit</cite> the hosts’ conversation with Dr. Ibram X. Kendi discussed how cisgendered, heterosexual
                     Black men do not make up the entirety of the Black population and to defend Black
                     people, you must also defend Black women and LGBTQ people. Furthermore, it was also
                     acknowledged that even though Black women and LGBTQ people often face the most vitriol
                     within the community, they are also the ones who are most prominent in organizing
                     for Black liberation. The Black Lives Matter movement, which is largely lead by Black
                     women and LGBTQ people, was cited as a significant example [<a class="ref" href="#story2019">Story and Gardner 2019</a>, 07:00].</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p48">The primary goal of this study was to identify the significance of Black Podcasts
                     as a counter public sphere meant to construct or disrupt narratives about the Black
                     experience in America. Using the Black public sphere as a guide and placing Black
                     podcasting within the context of more traditional forms of Black media, this research
                     primarily focused on three broad themes of community-building, resistance, and voice.
                     To distinguish these themes from the aforementioned topics, the five topics identified
                     in the analysis represent the most prevalent discussion points covered in the podcasts.
                     These topics were then used to help explain Black podcasts’ unique contributions to
                     the overarching themes of community-building, resistance, and voice that are present
                     in the Black media landscape at large.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p49">Community-building among Black podcasters is a significant theme within this study,
                     made most evident by the “U-N-I-T-Y” topic. This is not surprising considering, historically, Black media such as print
                     news, has been a unifying force for Black communities. This study demonstrates that
                     podcasters utilize their platforms as a beacon to attract and engage community members
                     and provide links to resources. In some respects, some podcasts, such as  <cite class="title italic">hey, girl</cite> and <cite class="title italic">Black Gals Livin’</cite>, promoted the importance of community building, often discussing how it is important
                     for one’s own self-care. In this way, the podcasts are essentially stressing the importance
                     of having a support system, which is something that many marginalized people might
                     feel they need living in a society founded on systemic inequality.</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p50">50</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p50">Some of the podcasts also promoted engagement with their own listeners, creating space
                     for feedback through email and social media. Taking into account that podcasting is
                     considered to be an intimate medium, one could view this as a way that the hosts are
                     ensuring that their listeners feel even more included in the conversation. Although
                     the scope of this study does not include an examination of the podcasts’ social media
                     engagements, the promotion of continuing the conversation on different platforms allows
                     for listeners of the show to connect with other listeners, potentially building a
                     digital community around the podcast. Some of the shows also mentioned and promoted
                     other Black podcasts and social media accounts, implying that the hosts recognize
                     the importance of promoting other marginalized voices. This ideally creates a loose
                     network that helps to link listeners to other Black resources and communities.</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p51">51</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p51">Some of the podcasts also use their platform to support the Black community outside
                     of the digital space. This is perhaps best noted in <cite class="title italic">Tea with Queen and J.</cite> and <cite class="title italic">HIM</cite>. In the former, the hosts have a segment dedicated to financially supporting Black
                     people who do not identify as cisgender males because they recognize how they are
                     disproportionally disparaged in society and may be in need of extra financial assistance.
                     The requests made in this segment can range from asking for support of a business,
                     organization or initiative to sending money so that a particular individual can buy
                     food. Although it is not an official segment of <cite class="title italic">HIM.</cite>, one of the hosts did speak about how he responds to requests made by the podcast
                     listeners for food or financial assistance. In these varying ways, Black podcasts
                     have a tendency to be community-oriented and are using their platforms to support
                     the Black community, especially those whose life experiences are negatively impacted
                     by multiple and intersecting systems of oppression. Black podcasters may also view
                     their podcasts as a way to digitally connect different parts of the community that
                     may be geographically separated.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p52">Historically, traditional forms of media have not been representative of Black people
                     both in terms of quantity and quality, which results in the perpetuation of Black
                     stereotypes. Black media have been critical for resisting these stereotypes by providing
                     counter-narratives of the Black experience. The second theme, resistance, shows up
                     in a number of ways in Black discourse via Black podcasting, and this is primarily
                     done by the increased representation of diverse Black voices and worldviews.</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p53">53</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p53">The topics “We Are Not a Monolith” and “Everywhere You Think We Ain’t” demonstrate that Black podcasts are pushing against dominant narratives of Black
                     people, which limits them to being categorized as one of a few different stereotypes,
                     by showcasing just how varied our voices are. The hosts were experienced and engaged
                     in a range of different topics and areas including, but not limited to sex, pop culture,
                     graphic design, nutrition, traveling abroad, entrepreneurship, and the music industry.
                     Simply placing Black voices in these spaces is an act of resistance against the false
                     perception that Black people are not present there or capable of holding knowledge
                     on a multitude of topics.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p54">Furthermore, most of the hosts did not identify as straight, cisgender men, who are
                     the dominant group within a patriarchal society. To the same effect that increasing
                     the visibility of Black voices in media is a form of resistance against racial oppression,
                     incorporating the voices, perspectives and lived experiences of people with intersecting,
                     marginalized identities is an act of resistance against misogyny, homophobia, xenophobia,
                     etc. Oppression in the form of racism has severely narrowed the representation of
                     the Black experience in media, and Black podcasts are contributing to broadening that
                     perspective.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p55">The poor representations of Black people in media can have a negative effect on how
                     Black people view themselves. Therefore, ideas of self-love and self-acceptance as
                     described in the “I Look at Myself and Said, Self” section suggests that self-reflection and self-definition can also be considered
                     a radical form of resistance. Accepting and loving one’s own Blackness leads to accepting
                     others’ definition of Blackness and has the potential to promote community building.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p56">Aside from self-definition as a form of resistance, some of the podcasts were much
                     more straightforward in their notion of resistance and used their platform to lambaste
                     White supremacist patriarchal capitalism. While the hosts of <cite class="title italic">Tea with Queen and J.</cite> are the only Black podcasters (within this study) to explicitly state this as the
                     purpose of their podcast, many others shared similar sentiments. At various points
                     during the episodes analyzed, the hosts would critique capitalism, racism, sexism
                     and homophobia. Sometimes the criticism was indirect, as was the case in <cite class="title italic">Chronicles Abroad</cite> where the hosts and guest made several comments speaking to how flawed and stressful
                     the structure of corporate America is. Other times it might present as a blatant statement
                     such as the one made by one host of the <cite class="title italic">HIM.</cite> podcast, “We’re all living in this capitalist bullshit society” [<a class="ref" href="#little2019">Little et al. 2019</a>, 27:55]. In <cite class="title italic">Jesus and Jollof</cite>, one of the hosts made a reference to how men often use the term “crazy” to reduce
                     and define women who make demands that the man is incapable of fulfilling [<a class="ref" href="#orji2020">Orji and Ajayi 2020</a>, 13:48]. As this analysis suggests, resistance for Black podcasters has different meanings
                     and different potentiality; however, it is clear that for Black podcasters, the concept
                     of resistance is both meaningful and significant, which historically, has always been
                     a primary mission of Black media.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p57">The third theme examined in this study focused on the diversity of voice within the
                     Black public sphere. For this study, voice describes more than just the sonic representation
                     of Blackness (though that is significant as well); voice also describes the perspective,
                     attitude, and opinion of different Black people whose life experiences have been shaped
                     by the region where they live or grew up, their socioeconomic class, their sexual
                     identity, their gender, and to some extent a shared history of slavery. Black podcasts
                     expand the Black public sphere, increasing the number of voices that participate in
                     it, therefore making it more representative of the diversity of Black communities
                     globally.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p58">Perhaps, what is the most unique about Black podcasts is the medium itself. As the
                     literature uncovered, podcasting as a digital medium is relatively accessible and
                     create an avenue for individuals to navigate around traditional media gatekeepers
                     [<a class="ref" href="#florini2015">Florini 2015</a>][<a class="ref" href="#steele2018">Steele 2018</a>]. This generates an opportunity for more Black people to build an online platform
                     and share it widely; including those who might not have access to own and/or participate
                     in more traditional media formats as a result of barriers related to class, gender,
                     sexual identity, disability, and various other factors.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p59">Beyond helping to remove media gatekeepers and financial barriers, Black podcasting
                     as a digital medium also help to remove geographical barriers, which adds to the diversity
                     of voice. With the help of digital technology, listeners can access shows hosted by
                     Black people throughout the diaspora. While Black newspapers and Black radio were
                     often limited in their reach, Black podcasts can attract Black listeners from nearly
                     anywhere in the world. Nigerian podcast shows such as <cite class="title italic">I Said What I Said</cite> have the potential to expand their listener base to Americans; conversely, Nigerian
                     listeners can also access Black American podcasts such as <cite class="title italic">Dreams in Drive</cite> – this is how cross-cultural interactions happen. Therefore, public discourse that
                     may once have been locally confined can now invite a wider range of voices and people
                     to participate globally. Whether physical or intangible, the barriers that podcasts
                     remove allow for more Black people of varying identities and experiences to participate
                     in public discourse with each other.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p60">While scholars such as Thakur argue that the digital landscape creates too many voices,
                     making it difficult to have one single agenda, it is important that Black people are
                     recognized as a diverse group [<a class="ref" href="#thakur2020">Thakur 2020</a>]. As a diverse group of people, Black communities will have different interests and
                     needs. The “We Are Not a Monolith” and “Everywhere You Think We Ain’t” topics provide examples of the variety of Blackness from identities to geographic
                     locations to hobbies and career interests. Furthermore, the “U-N-I-T-Y” topic shows that, even among all of these varying voices, there still exists a unifying
                     desire to uplift all Black people. Black podcasts recognize that efforts aimed at
                     supporting the unique needs of different Black communities do not have to be at odds
                     with each other and can serve to uplift Black people as a whole. Black podcasting
                     highlights the diversity of Black critical debate and it offers a space for the development
                     of cross-cultural interactions.</div>

                     Black podcasts have made to the Black public sphere. Despite podcasting’s major contributions
                     to Black representation, Black media production, Black resistance, and Black community
                     building, this study focuses on a small sample of Black podcasts, therefore, some
                     limitations do exist. Considering the breadth of platforms available to create and
                     listen to podcasts and the fact that there is not an all-inclusive database, several
                     podcasts were not included in the data population. Future research should compile
                     a more comprehensive list of Black podcasts and analyze a larger sample. Additionally,
                     this research explores Black podcast commentary but does not focus on audience engagement.
                     Future research should also consider examining audience engagement to determine how
                     Black podcasting shapes audience perceptions about topics salient to the Black community.
                     Finally, research demonstrates that not all Black voices and experiences are represented
                     equally within the Black public sphere, therefore, future research should take a more
                     intentionally intersectional approach to exploring Black podcasts to ensure that women,
                     LGBTQIA, disabled and other marginalized voices across the Black diaspora are included.</div>

                     consumers by focusing on “Negro” radio which served a critical function in the Black community by featuring a range
                     of topics including the achievements of local prominent Blacks and alerting listeners
                     who lived in violently segregated communities where it was safe to shop [<a class="ref" href="#newman2000">Newman 2000</a>]. Black radio drew particular interest at this time because advertisers were beginning
                     to understand the economic significance of targeting Black audiences, and this opened
                     the door for increased advertising and revenue for Black radio [<a class="ref" href="#chambers2008">Chambers 2008</a>]. However, with the passing of ownership deregulations sponsored by Reagan and Bush
                     administrations, Black radio, especially in smaller markets, suffered dramatically
                     as demonstrated by decreasing advertising revenue and Black radio ownership [<a class="ref" href="#scott1993">Scott 1993</a>]. </span></div>
