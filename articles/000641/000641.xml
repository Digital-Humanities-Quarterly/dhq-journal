			<dhq:abstract>
				<p>Podcasts exist as new form of digital media that is quickly growing in
					popularity but remains understudied. This study explores Black podcasts’
					contributions to the Black public sphere. The study found that Black
					podcasts are a space in which Black people participate in discourse that
					seeks to build community and resist against hegemonic structures. This
					study contributes to Black public sphere research and the digital
					humanities field by positioning Black podcasts as a counter-public for
					Black people.</p>
			</dhq:abstract>
			<dhq:teaser>
				<p>This study places Black podcasting within the context of more traditional
					forms of Black media to examine the themes of community-building,
					resistance, and voice.</p>

			<div>
				<head/>
				<p>This study builds on the work of scholars – most notably, Dr. Sarah Florini
					and Dr. Catherine Knight Steele — who critically examine Black voices in
					digital spaces in order to understand how both networked and independent
					Black podcasts, a successor of Black radio, shape discourse around a range
					of issues and events salient to the Black diaspora. Berry describes
					podcasts as a “horizontal media form…producers are consumers, consumers may
					become producers, and both can engage in conversations with each other”
						<ptr target="#berry2006" loc="144"/>. Berry argues that podcasts are
					not merely a converged medium which incorporates audio, web, and portable
					media devices, but podcasts are also a disruptive technology displacing
					established assumptions about audience consumption and media production and
					distribution.</p>
				<p>Using Black public sphere as an analytical tool, this study explores how
					podcasting contributes to the Black digital public sphere by answering
					questions related to how Black podcasters build community, perpetuate
					resistance, and contribute to Black critical debate. The Black Public
					Sphere is a significant analytical framework used to identify varying
					political positions and interrogate Black voices in digital spaces because
					it is a critical site where democratic discourse takes place and emerging
					diasporic social movements are envisioned <ptr target="#blackpub1995"/>.
					Black podcasts symbolize a digital space “in which intellectuals join with
					the energies of the street, the school, the church, and the city to
					constitute a challenge to the exclusionary violence of much public space in
					the United States” <ptr target="#blackpub1995" loc="2–3"/>. Analyzing
					podcasting as a critical media technology that fosters democratic debate
					creates an opportunity to observe the importance of Black podcasts to the
					field of digital humanities.</p>
				<p>Why is podcasting a critical medium? Podcasting is significant to Black
					content creators because it is a relatively cost-effective, user-generated
					medium with far reaching implications for education, information gathering,
					and community building, especially around topics that are salient to Black
					communities across the diaspora. Podcasts also serve as a critical archive
					for digital humanists because podcasts have the potential to become primary
					source documentation that centers the experiences and voices of a range of
					Black people – Black podcasters are collectively memorializing significant
					moments in Black culture. Historically, Black media have always been
					crucial for memorializing and publicizing the Black experience in America –
					Black print news, Black magazines, Black radio, and Black television have
					been critical in anchoring and fostering support for a range of social
					justice movements and for telling stories where Black people and their
					lives are centered <ptr target="#bacon2003"/>; <ptr target="#danky2009"/>;
						<ptr target="#fraser2016"/>; <ptr target="#payton2012"/>. </p>
				<p>Therefore, the purpose of this research is to demonstrate the significance of
					Black podcasting to both the Black diaspora and the digital humanities
					field. Attempting to narrowly define what denotes a Black podcast, and
					therefore Blackness, could prove to essentialize a vast and diverse group
					of people. In an effort not to do so, this study only seeks to define what
					was deemed as a Black podcast for the purposes of this research as opposed
					to providing a definitive definition for Black podcasts. For this study, a
					Black podcast is one that features a Black host or majority of Black hosts
					and centers Black people in the content it produces. Black podcasts have
					the potential to disrupt the ways in which mainstream media set the agenda
					for the salience of political topics. </p>
				<p>This study places Black podcasting within the context of more traditional
					forms of Black media. This literature will reveal that key to Black media
					are themes of community-building, resistance, and voice. The analysis
					conducted on the podcasts included in this study identified topics
					prevalent across the podcasts that indicate the different ways in which
					these podcasts express the aforementioned themes, adding to the legacy of
					Black media in their own unique ways.</p>
				<div>
					<head>Black Media and Representation</head>
					<p>In hegemonic societies, the dominant group’s privilege also includes the
						advantage of controlling the presentation and dissemination of
						information <ptr target="#squires2002"/>. Although access to public
						arenas is technically guaranteed to all, <quote rend="inline">all will
							not necessarily be equal within those spaces</quote>
						<ptr target="#squires2002" loc="450"/>. Unfortunately, groups
						oppressed by gender, race, ethnicity, sexual identity, disability, and
						class are not able to enjoy the same access to media resources, and
						their views and voices are not given the same legitimacy and presence
						in discursive activities <ptr target="#squires2002" loc="450"/>. More
						specifically, the oppression of Black people created an economic
						disparity and historically, this has impacted Black people’s access to
						the necessary capital needed to create and maintain their own media
							<ptr target="#johnson1993"/>; <ptr target="#selmanearnest1985"/>.
						Squires supports the need for marginalized groups to have separate
						spaces to discuss the specific interests of the cultural in-group
						without intrusion of the dominant group <ptr target="#squires2002"/>. </p>
					<p>Though mainstream media are instrumental in communicating ideas, news,
						and the prevailing viewpoint, it has not been as dedicated to
						providing nuanced analyses of the issues related to marginalized
						groups. For marginalized groups, alternative media spaces are part of
						a historical tradition that has been important to counterbalancing the
						overwhelming silencing of Black voices and life experiences in
						traditional media formats <ptr target="#wilson2013"/>. The cultural
						impact of Black mediated spaces, spaces that are occupied and
						organized by Black people and support Black centered discourse, draws
						its historical connection to <title rend="italic">Freedom’s
							Journal</title>, the first Black newspaper developed in 1827 in
						New York City <ptr target="#bacon2003"/>. According to Bacon, this
						publication was created as a means to amplify a wider range of Black
						voices within public discourse about the positioning and future of
						Black people, not only in the United States, but also around the
						world. The <title rend="italic">Freedom Journal</title> proved to be
						an important space for Black content creators to publicize the plight
						of Black people globally and encourage radical, emancipatory movements
							<ptr target="#bacon2003"/>; <ptr target="#fraser2016"/>. This set
						the stage for Black people to envision themselves as members of a
						larger intra-racial community, which would later be solidified through
						technological advances that resulted in Black radio and Black
						entertainment television.</p>
					<p>Black radio, like its press predecessor, provided a space for Black
						people to participate in discourse about their experiences with
						oppression, and it created a means for community building around a
						shared desire to mitigate their marginalization. Black radio proved to
						be integral during the Civil Rights Movement as it was a space where
						Black people were able to discuss their discrimination, and sometimes
						through coded messaging, Black broadcasters were able to communicate
						meeting locations for political demonstrations to their audience <ptr
							target="#johnson1993"/>; <ptr target="#williams2005"/>. Beyond
						the Civil Rights era, Black radio continued to exist as a space to
						discuss issues pertaining to Black communities as well as organize and
						promote various community events such as panel discussions, debates
						and protests held within Black communities <ptr target="#squires2002"
						/>.</p>
					<p>Black television stations and programs, while not as abundant as press
						and radio largely due to financial constraints, also proved to serve a
						similar purpose <ptr target="#selmanearnest1985"/>. Black TV provided
						platforms to hold discourse on race relations and issues within Black
						communities. There was an emphasis advocating for the Black
						communities they served and promoting various initiatives intended to
						empower these communities <ptr target="#blevins2019"/>; <ptr
							target="#heitner2013"/>.</p>
					<p>This suggests that Black media is critical for dismantling the
						privileging of dominant groups in mainstream media, and this is what
						makes Black podcasting a critical medium. Compared to radio<note> In a
							1956 article published by <hi rend="italic">Harper’s Bazaar</hi>,
							Alex Haley and Albert Abarbenel attempt to demonstrate the
							significance of Black consumers by focusing on <q>Negro</q> radio
							which served a critical function in the Black community by
							featuring a range of topics including the achievements of local
							prominent Blacks and alerting listeners who lived in violently
							segregated communities where it was safe to shop <ptr
								target="#newman2000"/>. Black radio drew particular interest
							at this time because advertisers were beginning to understand the
							economic significance of targeting Black audiences, and this
							opened the door for increased advertising and revenue for Black
							radio <ptr target="#chambers2008"/>. However, with the passing of
							ownership deregulations sponsored by Reagan and Bush
							administrations, Black radio, especially in smaller markets,
							suffered dramatically as demonstrated by decreasing advertising
							revenue and Black radio ownership <ptr target="#scott1993"/>.
						</note>, an antecedent of the podcast, podcast listening is typically
						very intense and interactive <ptr target="#newman2019"/>. Podcasts are
						participatory culture in that podcast hosts and listeners actively
						engage in sharing ideas and knowledge with one another <ptr
							target="#yee2019"/>. There is radical potential for Black
						podcasts to be the idealized communication space of the Black diaspora
						– a space meant for democratic debate to contest the marginalization
						of Black people globally and share visionary political ideas that have
						emancipatory potential <ptr target="#blackpub1995"/>; <ptr
							target="#florini2015"/>. In this context, Black public sphere is
						an ideal analytical tool in which to guide the examination of Black
						podcasts. </p>

				<head>The Black Public Sphere</head>
				<p>Theorist Jürgen Habermas argues that in the late 18th and 19th centuries,
					people gathered in what he coined as public spheres, or places frequented
					by the bourgeois (pubs, restaurants, opera halls, etc.) to debate and come
					to a consensus about political issues of the day <ptr target="#calhoun1992"
					/>. According to Fraser, the concept of the bourgeois public sphere is
					important to the development of theory because it is a place designed to be
					critical of the dominant, controlling group <ptr target="#fraser1992"/>.
					However, Habermas’ original work did not account for the varied voices
					within society <ptr target="#squires2002"/>. Though Habermas did attempt to
					rearticulate his original concept and eventually posed the idea of multiple
					public spheres, he fell short of examining other “nonliberal, nonbourgeois,
					competing public spheres” <ptr target="#fraser1992" loc="115"/>. To address
					this gap, a group of Black scholars – The Black Public Sphere Collective –
					began conceptualizing a Black public sphere in the mid-1990s. Based on the
					work of the Black Public Sphere Collective, this research aims to identify
					Black Podcasts as a counter public sphere whose significance lies in its
					potential to help construct or disrupt narratives about the Black
					experience in America.</p>
				<p> While Habermas envisions the public sphere as highbrow, culturally
					significant, exclusionary spaces for elites, historically, the Black public
					sphere has included such spaces as the Black church, hair salons, barber
					shops, community corner stores, and Black-owned and operated publications
						<ptr target="#blackpub1995"/>. Advances in technology created the
					means for people to connect across the nation and the globe so that the
					Black public sphere is no longer confined geographically; instead, Black
					people throughout the diaspora across class lines, gender identities, and
					age groups have the opportunity to participate in discourse about the past,
					present, and future of the diaspora <ptr target="#collins2010"/>; <ptr
						target="#squires2002"/>. Studies that examine Black-centered public
					discourse find that participants feel free to express themselves without
					fear of alienating the dominant group. Within these spaces, Black people,
					people of color, and allies debate and commiserate about a range of topics
					from microaggressions within the work place; police-involved shootings of
					unarmed Black people; shared cultural and regional language; and in some
					instances, they use these spaces to reclaim and rearticulate Black
					collective memories of historical protest groups (such as The Black
					Panthers) as a way to create counter-memories that disrupt the dominant
					media’s narrative of a post-racial society <ptr target="#florini2014a"/>;
						<ptr target="#payton2012"/>.</p>
				<p>Despite the potential of the Black public sphere to be a significant site of
					Black discourse, limitations do exist. This is especially true considering
					that worldviews and perspectives are also shaped, to some extent, by one’s
					experiences related to gender expression, socioeconomic status, disability,
					and sexual identity <ptr target="#hopkinson2018"/>. As Dill and Zambrana
					point out, many people within a marginalized group are also situated in
					multiple and competing systems of social stratification based on class,
					ethnicity, geographic location, and even skin color <ptr target="#dill2009"
					/>. While The Collective examined physical spaces (barber shops and
					churches) and cultural spaces (Hip-Hop music and movies) to examine
					Black-centered discourse, since then, other scholars have acknowledged
					online spaces as sites of critical Black-centered discourse <ptr
						target="#brock2012"/>; <ptr target="#florini2014b"/>. The combination
					of the educational nature of podcasts along with its capability to foster
					resistance raises questions about the medium’s potential to serve as a
					critical site of discourse to develop new pathways to Black liberation;
					therefore, this study limits its analysis to the following broad themes:
					community-building, resistance, and voice.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<head>Background on Podcasting </head>
				<p>A podcast is defined as an episodic digital audio file that is consumed from
					either streaming on or downloading from a computer, mobile phone, or other
					digital device <ptr target="#newman2019"/>. Although the term was coined by
					Ben Hammersley in 2004, as an amalgamation of Apple’s <q>iPod</q> and
						<q>broadcast</q>, the creation of podcast technology can be traced to
					Dave Winer’s development of Really Simple Syndication (RSS) software in
					2000 that allowed for the creation of digital feeds that could push audio
					content to subscribers <ptr target="#bottomley2015"/>. Podcasting was
					largely considered to be niche until 2014 when what is referred to as the
					“boom” occurred. This boom is largely credited to the success of the
					podcast <title rend="italic">Serial</title>, which received millions of
					downloads in a short period of time and became the first podcast to win a
					Peabody award <ptr target="#berry2016"/>; <ptr target="#bottomley2015"/>;
						<ptr target="#newman2019"/>. Yee notes that since 2014, podcasts have
					grown from more of a niche hobby for what could be considered the
						<q>average</q> person to becoming a platform leveraged by media
					personalities in order to strengthen their personal brand <ptr
						target="#yee2019"/>. Podcasts are usually free to listeners and
					available for download from a variety of Internet hosting sites <ptr
						target="#berry2006"/>. Based upon Apple’s listings alone, there are
					approximately 770,000 existing podcasts as of 2019 <ptr
						target="#newman2019"/>.</p>
				<p>Additionally, the ubiquity of podcasts makes it an ideal medium to reach mass
					audiences. In 2013, Apple announced its one-billionth podcast subscription
						<ptr target="#zickuhr2013"/>. According to research conducted by
					Edison Research and Triton Digital survey data, as of 2018, more than half
					of Americans over the age of 12 have listened to a podcast at some point,
					which is up from 9% in 2008 <ptr target="#audio2019"/>. Some of the most
					popular mainstream podcasts, such as those hosted by National Public Radio
					(NPR), boasted more than seven million listeners in 2018 <ptr
						target="#audio2019"/>. Podcasting has also become quite lucrative. A
					yearly study conducted by the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) and
					PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) predicts that podcast advertising revenue will
					reach over one billion dollars by the year 2021 <ptr target="#audio2019"/>.
					Unfortunately, it is not clear what percentage of these advertising dollars
					will be used to support Black podcasts because there is still very little
					data and research available that centers Black podcasts. </p>
				<p>Similar to other popular user-generated media such as blogging, podcasts
					challenge barriers that limit media ownership and provide a space for
					marginalized voices to have a platform. Therefore, it is important to
					consider the ways marginalized groups leverage podcasts for social justice,
					resistance, education, community, and more. This research is concerned with
					the ways Black podcasters use podcasting as a medium to create a
					counter-public and the resulting implications for the future of
					Black-centered public discourse.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<head>Black Podcasting</head>
				<p>Danielle "Berry" Sykes, a Black woman and self-proclaimed lover of podcasts,
					launched her website <ref target="https://www.podcastsincolor.com/"
						>PodcastsInColor.com</ref> in March 2015 as a means to catalogue and
					memorialize Black and other people of color (POC)-centered podcasts <ptr
						target="#berryND"/>. Sykes recognized the lack of visibility for
					marginalized groups’ podcasts on major podcasts lists; leveraging the power
					of Black Twitter, Sykes put out a call for Black podcasters to send her
					links to their podcasts. What started as a simple database of Black
					podcasts has since developed into the most comprehensive list of Black and
					other POC podcasts available on the Internet. Though PodcastsInColor.com
					does not purport to have a complete list of Black podcasts, it is
					significant for demonstrating the breadth of Black podcasts.</p>
				<p>According to Florini, Black people use the medium of podcasting as a
					counter-public in much the same way that Black people have used public
					spaces such as Black barbershops and beauty salons to engage in
					Black-centered discourse and to organize and promote social justice
					movements <ptr target="#florini2015"/>. In the analysis of the Black online
					media network, <title rend="italic">This Week in Blackness</title> or
						<title rend="italic">TWiB!</title>, Florini notes that Black
					podcasters use their shows in addition to other platforms like Twitter to
					organize and mobilize political action <ptr target="#florini2017"/>.
					Apiyo’s [2019] thesis research related to Black podcasting also supports
					the significance of Black podcasts in reinforcing cultural identity by
					producing specific, targeted content that centers the experiences,
					perceptions, and worldviews of the racial in-group <ptr target="#apiyo2019"
					/>.</p>
				<p>One important aspect of Black podcasts is the ways in which language serves
					as a significant cultural marker. Black podcasters use the medium to talk
					about news and information that is not typically covered on mainstream
					media, and they do so in a style not used in mainstream media — Black
					podcasters tend to embrace the use of African American Vernacular English
					(AAVE) <ptr target="#florini2015"/>. <q>Signifyin’</q>, another
					sociolinguistic marker of the Black racial identity as described by
					Florini, is a popular style of banter used by several Black podcasters <ptr
						target="#florini2014b"/>. Signifyin’ describes the use of humor and
					sarcasm within cultural context, and it requires the listener to possess
					certain cultural, historical, and political knowledge to understand the
					resistance and double-consciousness embedded within the communication
					style. The practice of signifyin’, historically, was used by Black
					communities as a form of critique against the dominant group. Though
					Florini is specifically analyzing communication practices of Black Twitter
					users, this sociolinguistic feature can also be applied to Black
					podcasters, and this is demonstrated in the way many Black hosts name their
					podcasts <ptr target="#florini2014b"/>. As an example, the podcast, <title
						rend="italic">The Black Guy Who Tips</title>, is sarcastically named
					as a means to resist the stereotype that Black people do not tip their wait
					staff in restaurants.</p>
				<p>Podcasting, a convergent medium, has served as an important outlet for Black
					creatives and content creators — Black podcasters have been able to use
					relatively inexpensive digital technologies to build mediated communities,
					contest their marginalization, provide a counter-narrative to stereotypes,
					and assert a more nuanced perspective on current issues facing Black
					communities globally. Similar to social media, podcasts allow for the
					masses to navigate around more traditional media gatekeepers to produce
					their own content. Also, like social media, podcasts have been proven to
					operate as sites of resistance for marginalized groups especially as it
					relates to issues with media representation. </p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<head>Methodology</head>
				<p><title rend="italic">Podcasts in Color</title> serves as the primary source
					of data because it is the largest comprehensive directory of podcasts by
					people of color <ptr target="#berryND"/>. The website lists hundreds of
					Black podcasts on a broad range of topics with hosts from a broad range of
					backgrounds. The data set was collected from <title rend="italic">Podcasts
						in Color’s</title>
					<title rend="quotes">2018 Top Podcasts</title> list which was compiled by
					Sykes, the website administrator, and based on host and listener feedback.
					The <title rend="quotes">2018 Top Podcasts</title> list contains a range of
					podcast categories that include comedy, women-hosted, LGBTQIA-hosted, art
					and culture, and business. This list yielded an initial population of 100
					podcasts. From this list, 20 podcasts were randomly selected to be examined
					by both researchers. This meant that each podcast had an equal chance of
					being selected for analysis. Random sampling was selected as a means to
					generate an unbiased sample of the data population. The appendix contains a
					full list of the podcasts included in this study.</p>
				<p>Podcasts included within the sample met the following criteria: (1) the
					podcast had at least one Black-identified host; (2) the podcast was
					included on the <title rend="italic">Podcasts in Color</title>
					<title rend="quotes">2018 Top Podcasts</title> list; (3) the podcast
					produced an episode within the timeframe of April 1, 2019 to April 1, 2020;
					and (4) the podcast was accessible via the Apple podcast application. The
					researchers acknowledge that podcasts are accessible through a number of
					applications such as Stitcher, SoundCloud, Spotify, and Podmatic; however,
					the Apple podcast application tends to be the most widely used to access
					podcasts.</p>
				<p>After the sample list of Black podcasts was developed, the researchers
					selected the most popular episode within the specified timeframe for each
					podcast according to ratings available through Apple iTunes as of April 3,
					2020. Each researcher independently listened to each of the selected
					episodes and identified the most prevalent topics covered on each episode,
					along with a short summary of the key points covered under each topic.
					While listening to the episodes, the researchers incorporated an audio
					analyzing methodology utilized by Lindgren that <quote rend="inline"
						>involves stopping frequently to take notes about the content</quote>
					<ptr target="#lindgren2021" loc="7"/>, and wrote down the timestamps of
					quotes that they believed best represented the identified topics. After
					independently identifying key topics and points for each episode, the
					researchers reconvened to compare observations, organize notes, and
					synthesize findings. Show topics included mainstream news stories; pop
					culture stories; and personal narratives related to sexism, Black women’s
					participation in motor sports, people-pleasing, fashion,
					community-building, graphic design, self-care, the 2020 pandemic related to
					COVID-19, health, women’s empowerment, entrepreneurship, religion, race,
					music, and travel. Through discussion, the researchers synthesized
					reoccurring, underlying topics which apply to the broad themes of
					community-building, resistance, and voice. The most prevalent topics among
					the podcasts selected for analysis were identity, self-definition, Black
					visibility, community, and resistance. Specific examples to illustrate the
					significance of each topic are analyzed in the following section.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<head>Analysis</head>
				<p>In popular Black podcast style, the five topics analyzed are aptly renamed:
					We are not a Monolith (identity); I Looked at Myself, and I said,
						<q>Self</q> (self-definition); Everywhere You Think We Ain’t (Black
					visibility); U-N-I-T-Y (community); and Going Against the Grain
					(resistance). Keeping in line with the signifyin’ that occurs within Black
					podcasts, both in the language used in conversations and the show titles,
					the researchers embrace the practice of signifyin’ through the naming of
					each topic to emphasize the double-consciousness embedded in Black
					discourse.</p>
				<p>The first topic, identity, which represents the range of diverse identities
					in Black podcasting and summarized in the <q>We Are Not a Monolith</q>
					section, focuses on the breadth of perspectives based on varying life
					experiences related to region, ethnicity, gender expression, sexual
					identity and more. The title of the section is significant as, in recent
					years, it has become a popular phrase used to recognize the diversity of
					Black people. The second topic self-definition, represented by the <q>I
						Look at Myself and said, Self</q> section describes different
					podcasters’ means of self-exploration. The section title is a paraphrase of
					a quote from the 2008 Tyler Perry movie <title rend="italic">Meet the
						Browns</title>. Although delivered as a comedic line, the phrase
					represents the current push for self-reflection and growth.</p>
				<p>The third topic Black visibility or <q>Everywhere You Think We Ain’t</q>
					addresses the issue of representation, or rather a lack thereof, for Black
					people, and this topic highlights the stories and experiences of those who
					occupy spaces (hobbies, regions, jobs) where Black people are
					under-represented. The fourth topic of community, which represents the
					community building that occurs within Black podcasts in the
						<q>U-N-I-T-Y</q> section, concentrates on the ways that Black
					podcasters use their platform as a means to connect with and address issues
					within their communities. The section title derives its name from the 1993
					Grammy award-winning rap song by mogul Queen Latifah, and this classic rap
					song is about creating unity and strengthening the Black community. The
					final topic – resistance – is summarized in the <q>Going Against the
						Grain</q> section. <q>Going against the grain</q> is a popular
					colloquialism, and within the context of this study, its meaning is more
					straightforward as this section describes how Black podcasters debate and
					discuss resistance to invisibility and marginalization.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<head>We Are Not a Monolith</head>
				<p>The podcasts selected for analysis highlighted a wide variety of perspectives
					based on a variety of identities related to gender, sexuality, class, and
					nationality. This first topic refers to the intersecting identities
					embraced by the podcasts’ hosts rather than the specific content produced
					in that there was such a broad range of Black identities represented and
					acknowledged. As an example, <title rend="italic">Jesus and Jollof</title>
					is hosted by two Nigerian-American women who incorporate their experiences
					of being the children of immigrants into their conversations. One co-host,
					Yvonne Orji stated:</p>
				<quote rend="block">If you’re listening and you are a child of immigrants, this
					is how we adopt people pleasing. We've all been there when your mom is
					like, <q>ahh. I have to make a pot of stew for the meeting. I’m so tired I
						just worked 40 hours. Oh, but if I don’t, if I don’t do it then
						they’ll say I’m a bad person</q>
					<ptr target="#orji2020" loc="8:50"/>.</quote>
				<p>Within this conversation, the hosts are stating that there are some
					experiences and sentiments that are distinct to Black immigrants that
					influence their actions and feelings. Orji’s comments suggest that an urge
					to please others at the detriment to oneself might be one result of those
					experiences.</p>
				<p>Florini’s work acknowledged that Black podcasters, likely due to a sense of
					comfort stemming from being in a Black mediated space, tend to embrace the
					use of AAVE <ptr target="#florini2015"/>. This was found to be the case for
					many of the podcasts in this study, however, shows such as <title
						rend="italic">Jesus and Jollof</title>, <title rend="italic">Black
						Gals Livin Podcast</title> and <title rend="italic">I Said What I
						Said</title> expand that notion as all of the hosts of the included
					podcasts are not African American. The latter two podcasts have hosts that
					reside in the United Kingdom and Nigeria, respectively. It would be more
					appropriate to say that Black podcasters embrace their own regional
					dialects and accents while speaking English that incorporates their varied
					identities whether it consists of being American, British, Nigerian, etc.
					or a combination of multiple identities.</p>
				<p>Podcasts such as <title rend="italic">Whoreible Decisions</title>, <title
						rend="italic">Keep It</title>, <title rend="italic">HIM.</title> and
						<title rend="italic">Strange Fruit</title> are ones in which the hosts
					identify as members of the LGBTQIA community and their content reflects
					that experience. On these shows, the hosts often insert perspectives and
					experiences that those who are not members of the LGBTQIA community would
					likely not share. For example, <title rend="italic">Strange Fruit</title>
					contained a conversation with Dr. Ibram X. Kendi that spoke to how society
					views Black LGBTQIA people as inferior to Black, cisgender, heterosexual
					people, which impacts their lived experiences. The show, by discussing a
					court case in which an employee’s pay was allegedly cut once their employer
					found out he was gay, exampled that some of these different experiences
					could manifest as workplace discrimination.</p>
				<p>Although one’s identity as a marginalized person influences one’s experience
					and will often be reflected in conversations, it is important that Black
					people are not confined to this narrative. For example, a large part of
						<title rend="italic">HIM.</title>'s episode was a conversation on
					dating and the five love languages. It is important that the hosts were
					free to have a general conversation on dating without it having to be
					specifically about dating as a gay Black man.</p>
				<p>These diverse identities are important in that they help to showcase there
					are multiple perspectives and experiences that encompass the Black
					experience, giving even more credence to the adage that <q>we are not a
						monolith.</q> These podcasts prove that the Black experience is not
					just limited to straight, cisgender, American men. These podcasts highlight
					the differing experiences inherent in the Black identity, and this is an
					important factor to highlight in Black media. Black podcasts make it much
					easier to expose these varied Black experiences to help combat the few and
					often negative depictions of Black people in mainstream media <ptr
						target="#wilson2013"/>. </p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<head>I Looked at Myself, and I said, <q>Self</q></head>
				<p>Common across all the podcasts was a focus on <q>self</q> – self-healing,
					self-motivation, self-acceptance, self-love, self-employment, and
					self-care. Although these can all have very different meanings and
					applications, a common topic of the podcasts revolved around motivating
					listeners to look inward, reflect and become attuned with one’s needs. Much
					of the focus on self was in response to the trauma that structural
					oppression places upon Black people. This is especially true for the
					messages of self-care, self-love and self-healing. The podcast hosts and
					guests recognized that oppression inflicts a severe amount of trauma, both
					mental and physical, upon Black people; Black podcasters advocate for their
					listeners to take the time to care for themselves. Shelah Marie, the guest
					on <title rend="italic">Dreams in Drive</title>, a podcast focused on
					entrepreneurship and hosted by Rana Campbell, provided insights on what led
					her to creating a healing space and stated that <quote rend="inline">women
						of color, and especially Black women, are tired of being told about
						themselves by people who are not Black. We’re tired of being told how
						to heal by people who are not sharing our same journey</quote>
					<ptr target="#campbell2019" loc="38:13"/>.</p>
				<p>Similarly, the podcasts also recognized that society’s negative depictions of
					Black people can sometimes influence one’s own ideas about their Blackness,
					which is why self-acceptance was also present. In relation to this, Bose
					Ogulu, the guest on <title rend="italic">I Said What I Said</title>, a
					podcast hosted by FK and Jollz, two Black millennial women living in Lagos,
					spoke about being fortunate to grow up in a household that taught her about
					the harm to global Black populations resulting from apartheid and
					colonization. As a result of gaining this understanding at an early age,
					she <quote rend="inline">grew with the realization that I was Black.
						African. Umm, that wouldn’t change. So part of being comfortable in
						your own skin is accepting and embracing yourself</quote>
					<ptr target="#abudu2019" loc="1:03:03"/>. The guest goes on to speak about
					how part of being able to embrace her Blackness is also tied to her ability
					to travel and engage with Black people in different countries and recognize
					similarities in culture while understanding that the perceived divisions
					among Black people were created by colonizers <ptr target="#abudu2019"
						loc="1:03:20"/>.</p>
				<p>In addition, some podcasts also pushed forth the idea of self-employment as a
					way for Black people to take more control of their own lives and careers.
					Both the hosts, Nubia Younge and Frantzces Lys, and guest, Sha’Cannon, on
						<title rend="italic">Chronicles Abroad</title>, a podcast dedicated to
					Black women living as expatriates, spoke at length about the need to move
					away from working in the traditional corporate America structure because of
					the stress it caused. Sha’Cannon spoke about having to deal with poor
					leadership, office politics, working extra hours, and various other hurdles
					that prevent one being able to enjoy their work. She proclaimed: </p>
				<quote rend="block">You’re just not happy. And then when you finally get a
					chance to get vacations approved. Did you hear that? You know, I have to
					ask for what is supposed to be a benefit to me. You know. <q>Can I go away?
						Because you’re draining the shit out of me. Can I go recharge?</q> You
					know, once you get it approved and you go, you almost can’t enjoy the
					vacation, because it’s short lived you know… by the time you really are
					into the vacation it’s over and you’re damn near depressed because you have
					to do what? Go back to the traffic and corporate America <ptr
						target="#younge2020" loc="04:16"/>.</quote>
				<p>In this statement, there is an expression of the levels of stress that can
					come along with working for someone else, especially under the corporate
					America structure, thus positioning self-employment as a more freeing
					option.</p>
				<p>Something of importance to note in these examples is that Black podcasts
					often encourage Black people to reach out across the diaspora in order to
					gain a greater sense of self. This is especially so for the concepts of
					self-healing and self-acceptance. Several of these podcasts seem to
					recognize the damage that White supremacy has done to Black people and view
					the Black diaspora as a restorative resource.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<head>Everywhere You Think We Ain’t</head>
				<p>Several of the podcasts focused on increasing visibility of Black, and
					sometimes other marginalized groups, in areas that they are normally not
					represented. This includes traveling abroad, certain pop culture spaces,
					and the graphic designing world. As an example, on the episode of <title
						rend="italic">Chronicles Abroad</title>, Nubia exclaimed that: </p>
				<quote rend="block"><title rend="italic">Chronicles Abroad</title> started
					because when we were, you know researching, or when I was researching, I
					didn’t find people that look like us. You know. Or in our age bracket. So
					that’s how it got started. And then I was so surprised that once I moved
					abroad, there were so many of us out here <ptr target="#younge2020"
						loc="02:38"/>.</quote>
				<p>Nubia’s comments speak to her podcast having an explicit intent to fill a
					void in the lack of representation of Black people as international
					travelers.</p>
				<p><title rend="italic">Revision Path</title> is a podcast dedicated to
					highlighting Black digital creatives, artists, designers and developers who
					normally go unnoticed within mainstream design industries. During the
					introduction, the show’s creator explains that the podcast is a, <quote
						rend="inline">weekly showcase of the world’s Black graphic designers,
						web designers and web developers. Through in-depth interviews you
						learn about their work, their goals and what inspires them as creative
						individuals</quote>
					<ptr target="#cherry2020" loc="00:45"/>. Although much of the interview
					focused on gaining insights on the guest’s experiences and career in
					graphic design, it was clear that race was a significant factor in the
					guest’s career trajectory — the guest often mentioned the issues he faced
					being one of the few Black graphic designers in the industry.</p>
				<p>The focus on featuring Black people in spaces where Black people are not
					typically visible in mainstream media is evident in a number of other
					podcasts. For example, the analyzed episode of <title rend="italic">Strange
						Fruit</title> included a segment that focused on Black women
					motorcycle clubs, and the guest on <title rend="italic">Dreams in
						Drive</title> discussed the impetus for launching her self-care
					business, noting that there were very few visible women in this space.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<head>U-N-I-T-Y</head>
				<p>While the concept of community-building was a broad theme examined in this
					study, topics related to community gatherings, community development, and
					grassroot organization tended to be a significant topic in most of the
					podcasts analyzed. Some of the podcasts focused on discussing different
					ways that the Black community could be uplifted; some podcasts commented on
					national Black liberation, and others commented on strategies for freedom
					specific to Black women and queer communities. <title rend="italic">Tea
						with Queen and J.</title> exemplify this with their <quote
						rend="inline">Pay Black Women Segment</quote> in which they promote
					the financial support of Black and Indigenous women, cisgender women and
					transwomen, as well as non-gender conforming Black and Indigenous people,
					by highlighting a person or persons who the listeners should support. By
					doing this, the hosts acknowledge that Black people who are not straight,
					cisgender men face many more obstacles and forms of oppression and are
					often overlooked in society.</p>
				<p>Similarly, Malik Little, one of the hosts of <title rend="italic"
						>HIM.</title>, spoke about the efforts he makes to support the Black
					queer community by providing food, shelter and funds if needed. The host
					voiced:</p>
				<quote rend="block">You know me bitch. If anyone of y’all talm’bout some y’all
					need a haircut, y’all need food. There have been people who have hit me up
					through the podcast who’ve asked for food, and bitch their refrigerators
					have been fulled. And y’all know how I feel about that, and that’s just
					because of the things that I’ve been through here <ptr target="#little2019"
						loc="28:45"/>.</quote>
				<p>What is of importance here is that the host is connecting how the podcast
					itself plays a role in supporting their community. He is not only exampling
					how he supports those who he personally knows in need, but also those who
					solicit help via the podcast.</p>
				<p>Additionally, Alex Elle, the host of the <title rend="italic">hey,
						girl</title> podcast, which espouses sisterhood among Black women,
					spoke about the importance of building community for self-care. She stated
					that, <quote rend="inline">For me, building community is important for my
						self-care, accountability and just for having a support system</quote>
					<ptr target="#elle2019" loc="03:10"/>. This sentiment was also shared on
					other podcasts, especially in reference to maintaining one’s sense of self
					in quarantine during the coronavirus pandemic. Podcast hosts also spoke of
					building a stronger podcast community by promoting stronger engagement with
					their listeners or other Black podcasts. Many of the podcasts have segments
					where they read listener emails or encourage the continuation of the
					conversation on social media with the hosts and other listeners.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<head>Going Against the Grain</head>
				<p>Ever present within many of the podcasts was a sense of resistance, both
					directly and indirectly. All of the prior topics can be viewed as acts of
					resistance in their own way and all of the observed episodes held some
					resistance to structural oppression to varying degrees. Some shows such as
						<title rend="italic">Tea with Queen and J</title> are direct about it;
					in their introduction, they state their intent to dismantle <quote
						rend="inline">White supremacist patriarchal capitalism</quote>
					<ptr target="#muhammad2020"/>. While some of the other podcasts might not
					state it as blatantly, their actions push against the status quo. For
					example, the guest on <title rend="italic">Chronicles Abroad</title> spoke
					at length about self-employment and moving further away from the stress and
					constraints that corporate America creates <ptr target="#younge2020"
						loc="03:15"/>. Myliek Teele, founder and owner of a popular
					subscription service that features Black beauty products, encourages her
					show’s listeners to <quote rend="inline">make sure that you’re putting the
						same energy and effort into your personal life as you are into your
						professional life</quote>
					<ptr target="#teele2019" loc="19:16"/>. For Black women, who are often
					taught to put everyone before their own needs, this serves as a means of
					resistance. </p>
				<p>As most of the podcast hosts identify as women and/or queer, much of the
					conversations also included resistance against sexism, transphobia,
					homophobia and other intersecting points of oppression. For example, on
						<title rend="italic">Strange Fruit</title> the hosts’ conversation
					with Dr. Ibram X. Kendi discussed how cisgendered, heterosexual Black men
					do not make up the entirety of the Black population and to defend Black
					people, you must also defend Black women and LGBTQ people. Furthermore, it
					was also acknowledged that even though Black women and LGBTQ people often
					face the most vitriol within the community, they are also the ones who are
					most prominent in organizing for Black liberation. The Black Lives Matter
					movement, which is largely lead by Black women and LGBTQ people, was cited
					as a significant example <ptr target="#story2019" loc="07:00"/>.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<head>Discussion</head>
				<p>The primary goal of this study was to identify the significance of Black
					podcasts as a counter public sphere meant to construct or disrupt
					narratives about the Black experience in America. Using the Black public
					sphere as a guide and placing Black podcasting within the context of more
					traditional forms of Black media, this research primarily focused on three
					broad themes of community-building, resistance, and voice. To distinguish
					these themes from the aforementioned topics, the five topics identified in
					the analysis represent the most prevalent discussion points covered in the
					podcasts. These topics were then used to help explain Black podcasts’
					unique contributions to the overarching themes of community-building,
					resistance, and voice that are present in the Black media landscape at
					large.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<head>Community</head>
				<p>Community-building among Black podcasters is a significant theme within this
					study, made most evident by the <q>U-N-I-T-Y</q> topic. This is not
					surprising considering, historically, Black media such as print news, has
					been a unifying force for Black communities. This study demonstrates that
					podcasters utilize their platforms as a beacon to attract and engage
					community members and provide links to resources. In some respects, some
					podcasts, such as <title rend="italic">hey, girl</title> and <title
						rend="italic">Black Gals Livin’</title>, promoted the importance of
					community building, often discussing how it is important for one’s own
					self-care. In this way, the podcasts are essentially stressing the
					importance of having a support system, which is something that many
					marginalized people might feel they need living in a society founded on
					systemic inequality.</p>
				<p>Some of the podcasts also promoted engagement with their own listeners,
					creating space for feedback through email and social media. Taking into
					account that podcasting is considered to be an intimate medium, one could
					view this as a way that the hosts are ensuring that their listeners feel
					even more included in the conversation. Although the scope of this study
					does not include an examination of the podcasts’ social media engagements,
					the promotion of continuing the conversation on different platforms allows
					for listeners of the show to connect with other listeners, potentially
					building a digital community around the podcast. Some of the shows also
					mentioned and promoted other Black podcasts and social media accounts,
					implying that the hosts recognize the importance of promoting other
					marginalized voices. This ideally creates a loose network that helps to
					link listeners to other Black resources and communities.</p>
				<p>Some of the podcasts also use their platform to support the Black community
					outside of the digital space. This is perhaps best noted in <title
						rend="italic">Tea with Queen and J.</title> and <title rend="italic"
						>HIM</title>. In the former, the hosts have a segment dedicated to
					financially supporting Black people who do not identify as cisgender males
					because they recognize how they are disproportionally disparaged in society
					and may be in need of extra financial assistance. The requests made in this
					segment can range from asking for support of a business, organization or
					initiative to sending money so that a particular individual can buy food.
					Although it is not an official segment of <title rend="italic"
					>HIM.</title>, one of the hosts did speak about how he responds to requests
					made by the podcast listeners for food or financial assistance. In these
					varying ways, Black podcasts have a tendency to be community-oriented and
					are using their platforms to support the Black community, especially those
					whose life experiences are negatively impacted by multiple and intersecting
					systems of oppression. Black podcasters may also view their podcasts as a
					way to digitally connect different parts of the community that may be
					geographically separated.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<head>Resistant</head>
				<p>Historically, traditional forms of media have not been representative of
					Black people both in terms of quantity and quality, which results in the
					perpetuation of Black stereotypes. Black media have been critical for
					resisting these stereotypes by providing counter-narratives of the Black
					experience. The second theme, resistance, shows up in a number of ways in
					Black discourse via Black podcasting, and this is primarily done by the
					increased representation of diverse Black voices and worldviews.</p>
				<p>The topics <q>We Are Not a Monolith</q> and <q>Everywhere You Think We
						Ain’t</q> demonstrate that Black podcasts are pushing against dominant
					narratives of Black people, which limits them to being categorized as one
					of a few different stereotypes, by showcasing just how varied our voices
					are. The hosts were experienced and engaged in a range of different topics
					and areas including, but not limited to sex, pop culture, graphic design,
					nutrition, traveling abroad, entrepreneurship, and the music industry.
					Simply placing Black voices in these spaces is an act of resistance against
					the false perception that Black people are not present there or capable of
					holding knowledge on a multitude of topics.</p>
				<p>Furthermore, most of the hosts did not identify as straight, cisgender men,
					who are the dominant group within a patriarchal society. To the same effect
					that increasing the visibility of Black voices in media is a form of
					resistance against racial oppression, incorporating the voices,
					perspectives and lived experiences of people with intersecting,
					marginalized identities is an act of resistance against misogyny,
					homophobia, xenophobia, etc. Oppression in the form of racism has severely
					narrowed the representation of the Black experience in media, and Black
					podcasts are contributing to broadening that perspective.</p>
				<p>The poor representations of Black people in media can have a negative effect
					on how Black people view themselves. Therefore, ideas of self-love and
					self-acceptance as described in the <q>I Look at Myself and Said, Self</q>
					section suggests that self-reflection and self-definition can also be
					considered a radical form of resistance. Accepting and loving one’s own
					Blackness leads to accepting others’ definition of Blackness and has the
					potential to promote community building.</p>
				<p>Aside from self-definition as a form of resistance, some of the podcasts were
					much more straightforward in their notion of resistance and used their
					platform to lambaste White supremacist patriarchal capitalism. While the
					hosts of <title rend="italic">Tea with Queen and J.</title> are the only
					Black podcasters (within this study) to explicitly state this as the
					purpose of their podcast, many others shared similar sentiments. At various
					points during the episodes analyzed, the hosts would critique capitalism,
					racism, sexism and homophobia. Sometimes the criticism was indirect, as was
					the case in <title rend="italic">Chronicles Abroad</title> where the hosts
					and guest made several comments speaking to how flawed and stressful the
					structure of corporate America is. Other times it might present as a
					blatant statement such as the one made by one host of the <title
						rend="italic">HIM.</title> podcast, <quote rend="inline">We’re all
						living in this capitalist bullshit society</quote>
					<ptr target="#little2019" loc="27:55"/>. In <title rend="italic">Jesus and
						Jollof</title>, one of the hosts made a reference to how men often use
					the term “crazy” to reduce and define women who make demands that the man
					is incapable of fulfilling <ptr target="#orji2020" loc="13:48"/>. As this
					analysis suggests, resistance for Black podcasters has different meanings
					and different potentiality; however, it is clear that for Black podcasters,
					the concept of resistance is both meaningful and significant, which
					historically, has always been a primary mission of Black media.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<head>Voice</head>
				<p>The third theme examined in this study focused on the diversity of voice
					within the Black public sphere. For this study, voice describes more than
					just the sonic representation of Blackness (though that is significant as
					well); voice also describes the perspective, attitude, and opinion of
					different Black people whose life experiences have been shaped by the
					region where they live or grew up, their socioeconomic class, their sexual
					identity, their gender, and to some extent a shared history of slavery.
					Black podcasts expand the Black public sphere, increasing the number of
					voices that participate in it, therefore making it more representative of
					the diversity of Black communities globally.</p>
				<p>Perhaps, what is the most unique about Black podcasts is the medium itself.
					As the literature uncovered, podcasting as a digital medium is widely
					accessible and creates an avenue for individuals to navigate around
					traditional media gatekeepers <ptr target="#florini2015"/>; <ptr
						target="#steele2018"/>. This generates an opportunity for more Black
					people to build an online platform and share it widely; including those who
					might not have access to own and/or participate in more traditional media
					formats as a result of barriers related to class, gender, sexual identity,
					disability, and various other factors.</p>
				<p>Beyond helping to remove media gatekeepers and financial barriers, Black
					podcasting as a digital medium also help to remove geographical barriers,
					which adds to the diversity of voice. With the help of digital technology,
					listeners can access shows hosted by Black people throughout the diaspora.
					While Black newspapers and Black radio were often limited in their reach,
					Black podcasts can attract Black listeners from nearly anywhere in the
					world. Nigerian podcast shows such as <title rend="italic">I Said What I
						Said</title> have the potential to expand their listener base to
					Americans; conversely, Nigerian listeners can also access Black American
					podcasts such as <title rend="italic">Dreams in Drive</title> – this is how
					cross-cultural interactions happen. Therefore, public discourse that may
					once have been locally confined can now invite a wider range of voices and
					people to participate globally. Whether physical or intangible, the
					barriers that podcasts remove allow for more Black people of varying
					identities and experiences to participate in public discourse with each
					other.</p>
				<p>While scholars such as Thakur argue that the digital landscape creates too
					many voices, making it difficult to have one single agenda, it is important
					that Black people are recognized as a diverse group <ptr
						target="#thakur2020"/>. As a diverse group of people, Black
					communities will have different interests and needs. The <q>We Are Not a
						Monolith</q> and <q>Everywhere You Think We Ain’t</q> topics provide
					examples of the variety of Blackness from identities to geographic
					locations to hobbies and career interests. Furthermore, the
						<q>U-N-I-T-Y</q> topic shows that, even among all of these varying
					voices, there still exists a unifying desire to uplift all Black people.
					Black podcasts recognize that efforts aimed at supporting the unique needs
					of different Black communities do not have to be at odds with each other
					and can serve to uplift Black people as a whole. Black podcasting
					highlights the diversity of Black critical debate and it offers a space for
					the development of cross-cultural interactions.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<head>Conclusion</head>
				<p>Using a sample of 20 podcasts, this study demonstrates the significant
					contributions Black podcasts have made to the Black public sphere. Despite
					podcasting’s major contributions to Black representation, Black media
					production, Black resistance, and Black community building, this study
					focuses on a small sample of Black podcasts, therefore, some limitations do
					exist. Considering the breadth of platforms available to create and listen
					to podcasts and the fact that there is not an all-inclusive database,
					several podcasts were not included in the data population. Future research
					should compile a more comprehensive list of Black podcasts and analyze a
					larger sample. Additionally, this research explores Black podcast
					commentary but does not focus on audience engagement. Future research
					should also consider examining audience engagement to determine how Black
					podcasting shapes audience perceptions about topics salient to the Black
					community. Finally, research demonstrates that not all Black voices and
					experiences are represented equally within the Black public sphere,

					included.</p>
