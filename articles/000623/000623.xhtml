                  <p>The following article presents a digital humanities exploration of indexing and
                     analyzing expressions of agency in Holocaust testimonies. Using a set of text
                     analysis methods to identify, classify, and visualize “semantic triplets,” we
                     show how attention to agency complements and extends conventional approaches to
                     indexing. Our examples come from two corpora of Holocaust oral histories: the first
                     were conducted in Displaced Persons camps in 1946 by an interviewer named David
                     Boder; the second were conducted by the USC Shoah Foundation Visual History Archive
                     in the 1990s. We focus on two salient testimonies from each corpus in order to
                     describe the methodology and what the analysis of agency can contribute to the
                     writing of “microhistories” of the Holocaust. Building on semantic web analyses,
                     the methods provide a groundwork for the development of a graph database to search
                     testimonies by agency and thereby provide historical insights about what people
                     report they did and what was done to them.</p>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">Oral histories conducted with survivors are infinitely rich sources for understanding
                     the complex events of the Holocaust. As first-person narratives, oral history
                     interviews with Holocaust survivors provide vital, eyewitness testimony about the
                     rise of Nazi Germany, the violent acts of genocide, and reflections on its aftermath.
                     The “era of the witness,” as Annette Wieviorka calls it, coincides with the
                     emergence of institutional recording initiatives, such as those at Yad Vashem, Yale’s
                     Fortunoff Video Archive, the US Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM), and the USC Shoah
                     Foundation Visual History Archive [<a class="ref" href="#wieviorka2006">Wieviorka 2006</a>]. Altogether, these
                     archives have recorded well over one-hundred thousand hours of testimony and
                     preserved hundreds of thousands of individual stories.</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">Because of the sheer size of these collections, indexing systems are critically
                     important for accessing their content. As such, all of these collections can be
                     searched effectively by names, dates, events, places, organizations, and various
                     subject headings. This is because “noun-based ontologies” form the taxonomic
                     structure of most indexing systems and finding aids. Attuned to the objective realm
                     of what was said, these ontologies help make the general content of an oral history
                     discoverable and accessible to researchers and the broader community of listeners.
                     When users enter keywords into a textbox, search and retrieval works because the
                     content is consistently and thoroughly described by a standardized, controlled
                     vocabulary [<a class="ref" href="#presner2016">Presner 2016</a>].</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">Not surprisingly, this is also the approach of most entity-recognition software
                     packages, such as OpenNLP [<a class="ref" href="#apache2017">Apache Software Foundation 2017</a>] and SpaCy [<a class="ref" href="#explosionai2020">Explosion AI 2020</a>], which are very successful at identifying things said,
                     such as proper names, organizations, geographic locations, historical events, dates,
                     units of time, quantities, and other numerical units, such as percentages and times
                     of day. But one of the fundamental limits is the focus on extracting isolated
                     elements (primarily nouns) rather than larger narrative units that describe what
                     people did and what was done to them. The purpose of this paper is to ask: In what
                     ways can oral histories be mined computationally to index how survivors narrate
                     behaviors, actions, reactions, assessments, and modes of self-orientation and
                     personal agency? This is vitally important in Holocaust testimonies since agency is
                     often described within networks of violence and coercion. This paper explores a
                     method for extracting, characterizing, and interlinking “semantic triplets” to
                     index and analyze vectors of action and agency, rather than just discrete topics,
                     themes, or isolated nouns. In so doing, we complement conventional indexing to gain
                     a
                     richer, nuanced understanding of the events, agents, and actions described in a
                     testimony.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">A semantic triplet is a grammatical unit consisting of <em class="term">Subjects</em>,
                     <em class="term">Relations</em>, and <em class="term">Objects</em>. <em class="term">Subject</em>s are units
                     consisting of nouns, primarily people, pronouns, and proper names, as well as direct
                     modifiers of the subject. <em class="term">Relation</em>s are verb units including one or more
                     verbs, related prepositions, and modifiers like adverbs. <em class="term">Objects</em>, both
                     direct and indirect, have a broader range of parts-of-speech and include regular noun
                     units, adjectives, adverbs, and more. For example, “I removed the yellow
                     patch”<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e230">[1]</a> is a semantic triplet expressed as active speech (something the
                     subject did), while “I was shipped to Auschwitz” is a semantic triplet
                     expressed as passive speech (something done by an unspecified agent to the subject).
                     By linking semantic triplets with descriptive, keyword metadata, we hope to show how
                     new patterns of agency and previously unrecognized “microhistories”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#zalcandbruttman2016">Zalc and Bruttman 2016</a>] can be highlighted and discovered within oral
                     histories. Rather than considering our method as a reduction or simplification of
                     the
                     text into discrete units of data, we argue that semantic triplets form a paratext
                     that highlights the richness of the testimonial narrative by adding to existing
                     metadata and methods of indexing.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p5">The psychologist and linguist David Boder has a unique place in the history of
                        Holocaust testimony collection because he was the first person to record the
                        voices of displaced survivors in their own words after the end of World War
                        II.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e254">[2]</a> In the
                        summer and early fall of 1946, he conducted over a hundred interviews with Jewish
                        survivors and other displaced people in nine different languages (mostly in German
                        and Yiddish, but also in English, Russian, Polish, French, Lithuanian, Latvian,
                        and Spanish), using a relatively new technology called a wire recorder.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e259">[3]</a> He carried out his interviews in Displaced
                        Persons (DP) camps and other safe houses in France, Switzerland, Italy, and
                        Germany, mostly with Jewish survivors of concentration camps and slave labor
                        camps, as well as with a smaller group of non-Jewish refugees consisting of
                        Mennonites and other Christians who had fled Soviet territories. The interviews
                        range in length from about 15 minutes to over four hours, with most about one-hour
                        in duration. He asked over 16,000 questions to his subjects in an attempt to
                        understand the historical events of the Holocaust and learn about his
                        interviewee’s personal story of loss and survival.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e267">[4]</a> Today,
                        Boder’s interviews are available online, as audio files in their original
                        languages as well as in English translation, through the Illinois Institute of
                        Technology’s “Voices of the Holocaust” project.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e293">[5]</a>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p6">After the interviews were recorded, Boder spent nearly ten years preparing a
                        3,194-page anthology of the survivor reports, which he called <cite class="title italic">Topical Autobiographies of Displaced People</cite>.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e309">[6]</a> It consisted of
                        typewritten translations, which he marked-up and indexed, of 70 of the
                        testimonies. He developed the first indices for characterizing the experiences of
                        Holocaust survivors, including a “subjects and situations” index with more
                        than 300 entries, a “geographic and ethnic” index with over 400 entries, a
                        “persons and organizations” index with close to 300 entries, and a
                        “trauma inventory” enumerating 46 types of trauma and violence experienced
                        by survivors. His “subjects and situations” index represented the first
                        controlled vocabulary for indexing Holocaust testimonies and included shared
                        experiences like deportations, selections, mistreatment, and killings as well as
                        personal experiences such as food deprivation, thirst, and screaming.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p7">Our analysis below will focus on two of these testimonies: The first is an
                        interview he conducted on September 26, 1946, with a 34-year-old, Polish-Jewish
                        woman named Anna Kovitzka (given the pseudonym “Anna Kaletska” by Boder).
                        Kovitzka lost most of her family, including her young baby, who she had given to a
                        Christian Polish woman in the hopes that the child would be able to survive. The
                        Polish woman was later denounced by a neighbor, and the child was killed. The
                        hour-long interview, spoken in Yiddish, covers about eight years of her life and
                        moves between her birthplace of Kielce, escaping the Grodno ghetto, being deported
                        to Auschwitz, and, finally, at the end of the war, being driven back into Germany,
                        and ending up after the war in Wiesbaden, where she is interviewed. The second
                        interview is with a German-Jewish survivor named Jürgen Bassfreund, who was also
                        deported to Auschwitz, where he worked in a forced labor factory. Conducted in
                        Munich on September 20, 1946, Bassfreund describes the rise of Hitler in Germany,
                        the deportation and death of his mother, and the horrific conditions he endured
                        while being transferred between multiple concentration camps. We chose this
                        particular interview because Bassfreund – who later changed his name to Jack Bass
                        – was re-interviewed by the USC Shoah Foundation in 1997, in his home in
                        Alabama.</div>

                        than ten hours, although most are between one and three hours in duration.
                        Indexers trained by the Foundation tagged the videos with keywords by linking

                        the segment (although not every segment had to have an indexing keyword). The VHA
                        derived its indexing protocols from the National Information Standards

                        places, and events for general searching, the index tends to obscure individual
                        actions and agency, not to mention aspects of performative delivery, subjective
                        experiences, and expressions of questioning, doubt, and possibility [<a class="ref" href="#presner2016">Presner 2016</a>]. Even though the aim of the index is objectivity, it is
                        important to underscore that a human listener decided what to index and what not
                        to index; a human listener decided what indexing term to use and what indexing
                        term not to use; and a human listener decided if a given narrative segment should
                        be described by a keyword or not. What is missing in the indexing system’s “philosophy of pursued objectivity”

                        focus on the testimony of Erika Jacoby. Jacoby, a Hungarian Jew deported to
                        Auschwitz with her family in the Summer of 1944, survived the camp with her
                        mother. Her family was among the hundreds of thousands of Hungarian Jews deported
                        to Auschwitz at the height of the mass murder operations at Auschwitz. She was
                        separated from her grandparents and other members of her family at the ramp of
                        Auschwitz-Birkenau and never saw them again. She was able to stay together with
                        her mother, and both were selected for forced labor at Auschwitz. Her testimony
                        was recorded in her home in Los Angeles in 1994. Like the testimony of Bass, the
                        interview follows the structure of a chronological life-story, beginning with
                        childhood, experiences during the War and Holocaust, liberation, and eventual

                     a
                     Holocaust triplets graph database (networks of semantic triplets derived from the
                     testimonial transcripts). As shown in Figure 1, we use both interview transcripts
                     and
                     their metadata, while our main contribution, as discussed in this article, is the
                     identification, extraction, and categorization of semantic triplets from the
                     transcripts. Our process can be summarized as follows: First, we identify and extract
                     triplets algorithmically from the cleaned transcripts; then, we use text mining
                     methods to assign categories and cluster the triplets; finally, the results are
                     manually reviewed (human check, correction, and curation). After that, they can be
                     stored, along with the original metadata, in a Tableau dashboard or eventually a
                     graph database for querying, indexing, and visualization. We will introduce these
                     core methods below.</div>

                        semantic triplets ([<a class="ref" href="#rusher2006">Rusher 2006</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#peter2001">Peter 2001</a>]). In
                        general, triplets take the form of subject-predicate-object expressions and can be
                        searched through network relations between entities. Digital humanities scholars
                        have used semantic web methods, such as linked data, to facilitate interoperable
                        research structures to analyze social or cultural datasets [<a class="ref" href="#hyv%C3%B6nen2020">Hyvönen 2020</a>] as well as to model scholarly processes in the
                        humanities by exploring the productive tension between formally structured,
                        semantic data and humanities scholarship [<a class="ref" href="#bradleyandpasin2017">Bradley and Pasin 2017</a>].
                        Inspired by both the database design of Triplestore and RDF store and their
                        humanistic applications, we have developed our own process of extracting semantic
                        triplets from spoken testimonies. Our approach is best situated in the field of
                        information extraction for domain specific documents (in our case, Holocaust and
                        genocide testimonies), while the methods and ideas are replicable in other domains
                        such as oral histories more broadly, autobiographies, and personal narratives. </div>

With the advancement of machine learning
                        technologies, we now see a trend of switching the research focus from extracting
                        informative and broad coverage semantic triplets to producing canonical triplets
                        which are linguistically coherent [<a class="ref" href="#angelietal2015">Angeli et al. 2015</a>]. This trend of
                        research tends to focus on improving the extractors’ accuracy, and, to date, there
                        are few applications that use semantic triplets to analyze spoken, personal
                        narratives, which resist formalized structures. Our semantic triplets extraction
                        method is an automated, rule-based process to aid close reading and focuses on
                        extracting expressions of agency and statements that speak to memories of

                        In the sentence “I was clinging to the window,” we
                        detect the active agency of window clinging with “I” as
                        the subject noun chunk and “the window” as the object
                        noun chunk. In this case, the verb chunk includes the verb, an auxiliary verb, and
                        a preposition. Using this extraction method, in our four example testimonies, we
                        are able to extract more than 3,000 triplets. Some sentences may contain multiple
                        triplets, such as this sentence: “I went with her down to the
                        door, and there I stood across the street, hidden in the gate, and I saw how my
                        child was lying on the snow.” In this example, four triplets were

                        Waletzky’s [<a class="ref" href="#labovandwaletsky1997">Labov and Waletsky 1997</a>] social-linguistic model of
                        narratives, where clauses are characterized by temporal organization (the order in
                        which the subject narrates events and actions in the story), evaluative
                        description (personal assessments made by the narrator), and contextual
                        orientation (usually information provided by the narrator that helps orient the
                        listener). Statements of evaluation provide judgment about a person or situation,
                        while statements of orientation provide contextual or relational information.
                        Various scholars have developed tools or solved related problems using the Labov
                        model: For example, Swanson et al. [<a class="ref" href="#swansonetal2014">Swanson et al. 2014</a>] created a part
                        of speech (POS) based algorithm for clause type detection and labelling based on
                        this model; and Saldias and Roy [<a class="ref" href="#saldiasandroy2020">Saldias and Roy 2020</a>] used this model
                        to train a classifier to analyze and compare spoken personal narratives. Although
                        these applications to characterizing narratives focus on the clause level, the
                        Labov model is also applicable to our research because triplets are derived from
                        clauses and need to retain semantic information.</div>

                        between different types of expressions of agency in oral histories. We divide
                        descriptions of agency into four sub-categories: active, passive, coercive, and
                        speculative speech. Active and passive speech are, respectively, actions done by
                        the subject of the triplet and actions done by others to the subject; coercive
                        speech may have an active structure but a passive meaning since it represents
                        something the subject was forced to do (sometimes without mentioning the person or
                        group responsible for the coercion); and, lastly, speculative speech, often
                        expressed through modal verbs, represents an uncertain or imaginary action, or a
                        statement of possibility, desire, ability, or futurity. While these categories are
                        not perfect or definitive, they help to identify the general kinds of speech

                        has been around for decades in Holocaust historiography [<a class="ref" href="#hilberg1992">Hilberg 1992</a>]. While not absolute or unproblematic, we strive to disambiguate subjects and
                        objects in triplets when they are identified as people or groups. To do so, we
                        first used the Entity Recognition pre-trained models in SpaCy to determine the
                        category of a NOUN (people, organizations, geographic locations, and so forth).
                        We, then, manually classified the detectable entities, where possible, into victim
                        and perpetrator groups. For example, the phrases “the German Army,”
                        “the SS,” or “the Gestapo” are detected as organizations and marked as
                        Perpetrator, whereas the interviewee (“I” and “we”) as well as familial
                        units (parents, grandparents, sister, brother, and so forth) are marked as Victim.
                        Pronouns, however, were not disambiguated. This classification method will always
                        be incomplete, as many subjects and objects do not unequivocally belong to the
                        victim or perpetrator group. The “gray zone” contains bystanders,
                        aid-providers, “implicated subjects,” and people who moved across categories
                        and do not easily fit the binary ([<a class="ref" href="#rothberg2019">rothberg 2019</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#luft2015">Luft 2015</a>]). These and other such subjects and objects are also

                        an oral history. For the ones that are certain, we created lists of victim and

                     1946, rather than the 1990s). Due to the large number of triplets, we needed to
                     develop ways to categorize and cluster the results. This entailed categorizing the
                     triplets into six types of speech, assigning Victim and Perpetrator identities to
                     certain subjects and objects, and experimenting with using a Wordnet-based
                     characterization of the objects to cluster them by lemma and categories.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e783">[12]</a> For our initial version
                     of the triplet extraction process, 6.5% of the triplets were manually corrected due
                     to incorrect or incomplete subjects, verb relations, or objects. In addition, about
                     14% were manually removed from the original output because the triplet did not make
                     sense grammatically or was misidentified as a triplet. The challenges and
                     shortcomings of the triplet extraction process are discussed in section 5.2. To
                     better analyze the triplets and their characterization, we created an interactive
                     Triplets Dashboard, shown in Figure 4, which brings together the corrected triplets
                     output, an object lemmas bubble plot, and multiple other filters.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e796">[13]</a>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p28">As a finding aid, the dashboard helps us query and sort the triplets by interview,
                     subject, object, speech type, and more. In the dashboard, a search for semantic
                     triplets can be initiated on any term, category, or type of speech both within a
                     given testimony or across a group of testimonies. In the screenshot, we see the
                     triplets around Bassfreund’s description of his deportation from Berlin to his
                     selection for forced labor in Auschwitz. They evidence a wide-range of speech acts,
                     including active speech about other people’s agency (“they gave
                     us six slices” and “they placed a can”), passive
                     speech (“we were put on trains” and “we were driven out of the cars”), coercive speech (“we
                     had to sign affidavits” and “we have to leave
                     Germany”), speculative speech (“I shall never forget
                     those screams”), evaluation (“it was
                     uncomfortable” and “the screams were terrible”),
                     and orientation (“I have forgotten something” and “the people had a premonition”). Looking further at the
                     contextual information for the coerced action of being forced to sign affidavits,
                     for
                     example, we see the following terms: “our disloyalty,”
                     “Germany,”
                     “account,” and “hostility.” The
                     original sentence can be seen on the far right of the triplet output, as translated
                     by Boder: “Before being sent away we had to sign affidavits that
                     we have to leave Germany on account of our disloyalty and hostility to
                     Germany.”<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e854">[14]</a>

                     speech within a testimony. For example, leading up to and following his description
                     of being deported to Auschwitz, we can visualize all the passive and coercive
                     statements made by Bassfreund in which “I” or “we” is the subject. As shown
                     in Figure 5, there are over 50 such instances of passive and coercive speech
                     described in this section of his interview with Boder (about ten type-written pages).
                     Bassfreund emphasizes, with precise language, what was done to him and the Jewish
                     community by the Nazis (we were surrounded, taken, moved, driven out, loaded on, led
                     to, rubbed with, shoved into, sent into, transferred to) as well as what was
                     specifically done to him (I was forcibly taken, assigned, sent, transferred).<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e879">[15]</a>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p30">We can now show our approach to semantic triplets extends and deepens topical
                     indexing by pairing the triplets with the human-created indexing terms. As developed
                     by both Boder and the Shoah Foundation, we see a significant continuity in terms of
                     topics and themes (places, time periods, people, conditions, and events) used to
                     index the testimonies. For instance, on pages 292-293 of Bassfreund’s testimony in
                     <cite class="title italic">Topical Autobiographies</cite>, Boder indexed the testimony
                     with the following terms: bathing, clothing, hair cutting and shaving, professional
                     criminals, confiscations, punishments, and tattoos. Similarly, in segment 25 of Bass’
                     testimony, we see the following indexing terms from the Shoah Foundation: Auschwitz
                     I
                     (Poland: Concentration Camp), camp forced labor, camp latrines, camp living
                     conditions, camp selections, Poland 1941 (June 21) - 1945 (May 7), prisoner hair
                     cutting forced labor, transfer from Auschwitz III-Monowitz (Poland: Concentration
                     Camp), and transfer to Auschwitz I (Poland: Concentration Camp). While these topics
                     certainly give us guidance for finding the overarching places, dates, conditions in
                     captivity, movement, and forced labor, the indexing is not at the level of sentences
                     or clauses and, therefore, we do not really know what Bassfreund/Bass did or what
                     was
                     done to him. As we see in Figure 6, we produce a corresponding network of just a few
                     of the triplets derived from these specific parts of his testimonies. The
                     interrelated set of triplets provide information about un-indexed subjects and agents
                     (both victims and perpetrators), un-indexed actions (written on, picked up by, worked
                     in, filled, sent), and un-indexed objects (the formation, their stomach, a truck,
                     the
                     crematories, human hair, mattresses, packages, and a mountain). Altogether, they
                     point us toward ways of using the extracted semantic triplets to read, mark-up, and
                     index testimonies by including microhistorical accounts of actions by both victims
                     and perpetrators. </div>

                        Sonderkommando rebellion in Auschwitz) are rightly known and celebrated, there has
                        been comparatively less appreciation of the range of everyday, seemingly ordinary
                        acts of resistance by individuals. One historian who is working at the vanguard of
                        this reappraisal of Jewish agency is Wolf Gruner, who has delved into numerous
                        police and municipal archives in Germany to uncover the wide-range of acts of
                        defiance, opposition, and protest by Jews living in Nazi Germany ([<a class="ref" href="#gruner2011">Gruner 2011</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#gruner2016b">Gruner 2016b</a>]). In his studies of “microhistories,” he has unearthed thousands of examples of
                        Jews mounting both formal and informal protest, ranging from the filing of
                        petitions and government complaints to outright acts of defiance, such as sitting
                        on benches marked “Aryan only” or refusing to use the forced middle name of
                        “Israel” or “Sara,” to physical and armed resistance against Nazi
                        officials [<a class="ref" href="#gruner2016a">Gruner 2016a</a>]. For our purposes here, we are interested
                        in using our computational method of identifying networks of semantic triplets to
                        find underappreciated or largely unknown acts of everyday resistance within
                        Holocaust testimonial narratives. Our argument is that triplets point to a
                        wide-range of small-scale actions that would otherwise go unremarked, since they
                        do not, generally speaking, rise to the level of what might be indexed as “acts
                        of resistance.” Oftentimes, these actions are not even considered to be
                        “indexable content,” and thus they are extremely difficult to locate.</div>

                           as she describes the violent separation and loss of her family and, in
                           particular, her efforts to save her baby girl who was born in the Grodno
                           ghetto. With her husband, she managed to escape the ghetto in the hopes of
                           finding someone to care for her child. Shortly after giving up the child to a
                           Christian woman who promised to protect her, Kovitzka was deported to
                           Auschwitz. The child, unfortunately, did not survive as the Christian woman was
                           denounced for trying to protect a Jewish baby. Examining the indexing terms
                           used by Boder to mark-up her testimony, we see a wide-range of themes and
                           topics, including: geographic locations (Wiesbaden, Kielce, Grodno, Slonim,
                           Lvov, and Auschwitz), living conditions and objects (epidemics, starvation,
                           thirst, illness, sleeping accommodations, and clothing), people (children,
                           Gestapo, Prisoners-of-War, family, and Gypsies), and events (looting,
                           childbirth, burials, flight, killings, escapes, work, bathing, rebellion, and
                           appells or roll calls in camps). The last group of events certainly raises
                           questions about actions, but without further analysis, we cannot know who was
                           looting, escaping, working, rebelling, or even giving birth to a child.
                           Moreover, without delving into the testimony, we cannot uncover specific
                           vectors of agency (such as who did what, how did they do it, and to whom).</div>

                           and, ultimately, the child’s fate: “I must save my
                           child,”
                           “My man handed the child,”

                           appreciate these critical actions and thus begin to index the testimony attuned

                           arrival ramp, Jacoby and her mother are selected for the slave labor camp.
                           Their heads are shaven; they are deloused for lice; and they are given meager
                           clothes. Most of Jacoby’s testimony, then, focuses on everyday life in
                           Auschwitz, including forced labor, sleeping conditions, food rations, violence,
                           and abuse. While the associated triplets bear witness to her struggle for
                           survival, our indexing of agency in Jacoby’s testimony also included the
                           following groups of triplets. As shown in Table 3, after one passive
                           construction, we see five successive, active constructions and one triplet

                              interesting events that happened to us in Auschwitz. I just want to tell you
                              one that was very important. And I don’t think I have time to describe
                              Auschwitz. And I’m sure that it’s well known. But we were– one, one day, we
                              were taken to a bath. We were taken to a bath about once a week or once
                              every other week. And as we were marching, we were go– we were going by a
                              German officer’s area. And I saw a swimming pool. And I jumped out of the
                              line, and I dove into the swimming pool. And I swam across the pool, and I
                              got back. And they didn’t shoot me, and I survived. But of course, my mother
                              almost died. I mean, it was such an irr– irresponsible act from my part. But
                              I was young, and I, I needed to be alive. And I did that. [<a class="ref" href="#jacoby1994">Jacoby1994</a>, 51:40-52:30]</p>

                        <div class="ptext" id="p39">Indeed, there were two “pools” on the grounds of Auschwitz: one for
                           prisoners and one for SS officers, near blocks 7 and 8. They were built as
                           reservoirs to store water rather than be used for recreational swimming. Today,
                           a sign clarifies the remains of the structure: “Fire
                           brigade reservoir built in the form of a swimming pool, probably in early
                           1944.” When Jacoby arrived in Auschwitz in the summer of 1944, the
                           pool would have been complete. The Shoah Foundation manually tagged these
                           segments of Jacoby’s testimony with the following keywords: <em class="term">camp intake
                              procedures</em>, <em class="term">camp prisoner marking</em>, <em class="term">camp family
                              interactions</em>, <em class="term">loved ones’ contacts</em>, <em class="term">prisoner
                              external contact</em>, and a single person tag, her mother, Malvina
                           Salamonovits. Judging by these tags, one might expect her discussion to focus
                           on procedural elements of the camp, perhaps coupled with how she and her mother
                           survived together. There is nothing in the indexing that would indicate jumping
                           out line, diving into the pool, and swimming across. While we can certainly
                           read or hear Jacoby talking about this experience if we happened to land on
                           this part of her testimony, it remains <em class="emph">an unindexed action</em>, which
                           otherwise submerges a significant act of resistance and agency. Through the
                           computational extraction of triplets, we can index, hone in on, and appreciate
                           this defiant act.</div>

                        <div class="ptext" id="p40">After Auschwitz is liberated by the Soviet army, Jacoby relays that she and her
                           mother left the camp in search of food and safety from sexual assaults by
                           Russian soldiers. Over the next three and a half minutes (1:18-1:21), she
                           describes a set of actions that helped her and her mother survive. She also
                           tells of acts of revenge and anger committed by her 16-year-old self. Two of
                           the three segments are tagged by the Shoah Foundation as <em class="term">food
                              acquisition</em> and <em class="term">looting</em> (the third is not tagged at
                           all). These topical terms convey little about the agency involved and the kinds
                           of actions that a listener may want to search for and find in her testimony. In
                           Table 4, we reproduce the full set of 23 semantic triplets that our methodology
                           identified over these three minutes. All forms of agency are included as well
                           as all subjects and objects. The “we” subject refers to Erika and her
                           mother.</div>

                        <div class="ptext" id="p41">While <em class="term">food acquisition</em> and <em class="term">looting</em> are indexing terms
                           that signal the overall set of content, these terms tell us nothing specific
                           about what Erika and her mother did in the days after liberation; they tell us
                           nothing about the vectors of agency and reasons for their actions; and they
                           tell us none of the details of the actions conveyed in her testimony. And
                           perhaps more pointedly, the indexing terms tend to obscure more than they
                           reveal: Far from abstract topics, <em class="term">food acquisition</em> involved the
                           specific act of stealing and eating a pig (a non-kosher act of desperation for
                           survival), while <em class="term">looting</em> was connected to Jacoby’s immediate
                           post-War actions, which reflect personal anger, acts of revenge, and the
                           longing for a <em class="term">normal life.</em> The objects she takes from a home are
                           symbols of family life, domesticity, and normalcy: a white tablecloth, an
                           apron, and a little silver cup. Her act of <em class="term">looting</em> is to take
                           these everyday, material objects from somebody’s home, the first possessions
                           that she acquires after liberation from Auschwitz.</div>

                     “semantic triplets” – strictly speaking as subjects, verb relations, and
                     objects – can oversimplify narrative expressivity when truncated, extracted, or

                     as discuss how our newer, “meticulous” triplet extraction process (version 2.0)

                     <div class="ptext" id="p43">As is evident in many of the triplets, pronouns often exist in subjects and
                        objects, and they are sometimes ambiguous. For example, there are multiple
                        references to “he,”
                        “she,”
                        “they,” or “them” where the pronoun could refer to a perpetrator in one
                        line but a victim in the following. Thus, a coreferencing solution for the
                        triplets needs to disambiguate pronouns or, at the very least, link triplets
                        together such that the coreference can be clearly identified. We experimented with
                        using NeuralCoref, a coreference resolution python package which annotates and
                        resolves coreference clusters using a neural network [<a class="ref" href="#huggingface2019">Hugging Face 2019</a>]. However, this pre-trained language model is based
                        on out-of-domain text data, and it is only effective about half the time, which is
                        not precise enough for our needs. </div>

                        Holocaust and genocide testimonies. This close-domain model was initially trained
                        by annotating testimonies using BRAT, a web-based annotation tool that allows
                        customized labels for entities and coreferences [<a class="ref" href="#stenetorpetal2012">Stenetorp et al. 2012</a>]. Inspired by the annotation process of entities and coreferences in an English
                        literature dataset, we will use a customized set of entity types, including named
                        people, groups, communities, as well as other regular named-entities like
                        organizations and geo-political entities [<a class="ref" href="#bammanetal2019">Bamman et al. 2019</a>]. Our hope
                        is that the training model, derived from a diverse set of annotated Holocaust
                        testimonies, will help us disambiguate pronouns throughout a corpus. </div>

                        challenge is that important expressions that are not triplets are simply not found
                        (for instance, “we were separated”). Another challenge
                        is how to capture fuller object phrases and distinguish direct and indirect
                        objects. In this version, we capture both, and usually the direct object is part
                        of the triplet and the indirect object is part of the contextual information; in
                        the more “meticulous” version, we capture fuller object phrases by extracting
                        from the “context” as much as possible. Although the objects tend to be
                        longer, they are more complete and integrate the contextual elements within the
                        object phrase itself. This newer version results in both more triplets being
                        extracted and higher accuracy.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e2033">[16]</a>

                        “if, then” statements or ones that begin with a form of negation. For
                        example, this sentence spoken by Bassfreund, is turned into three triplets: “And it was already night and the SS opened the doors and said if
                        we throw out the dead bodies we shall get some food.”[<a class="ref" href="#bassfreund1946">Bassfreund 1946</a>] Getting food from the SS is dependent upon the
                        victims being forced to throw out dead bodies from the train. Although the
                        triplets are captured individually, maintaining the specific contingency of the
                        actions and understanding the reasons for them requires human review and
                        interpretation.</div>

                        see relationships across a testimony or corpus, we also preserve the narrative
                        sequence of the triplets in our extraction process since the context for a triplet
                        certainly matters both within an individual sentence and between sentences. For
                        instance, when Bass says: “Well, you could tell. These guys
                        were very rough and very bad. They used to beat you up, and scream, and holler,
                        and push you. And hit you with a– a rubber– piece of rubber there. It looked
                        like a rubber hose.”[<a class="ref" href="#bass1997">Bass 1997</a>] Our triplet extraction
                        method maintains the contiguity between the description of the men (former
                        criminals who the Nazis put in place as supervisors in camps) so that the last
                        triplet (“it looked like a rubber hose”) continues to
                        make sense within this context. Sequential groupings are one way to maintain
                        narrative continuity. </div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p48">Another basic challenge that we face is extracting triplets from fragmented,
                        vernacular speech, which the process often has trouble parsing. Survivors
                        sometimes switch from first-person narration to second or third-person; sometimes
                        the sentences contain incomplete thoughts, repetitions, or stuttering; sometimes
                        the transcribed sentence lacks regular punctuation; and sometimes survivors quote
                        the speech of others directly or indirectly. The triplet extraction process has no
                        way of telling if a triplet refers to the quoted or attributed speech of someone
                        else. For example, Anna Kovitzka says: “Once my man said:
                        ‘I can’t make peace with them. Our child must be saved even if we two
                        shall die.’”
                        [<a class="ref" href="#kovitzka1946">Kovitzka 1946</a>] While two triplets are extracted (“I can’t make peace with them” and “our
                        child must be saved”), the triplets are not attributed to her husband
                        because the phrase “once my man said” is not part of
                        either triplet. </div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p49">To take another example: In his interview with Boder, Bassfreund says: “We were rubbed with kerosene”[<a class="ref" href="#bassfreund1946">Bassfreund 1946</a>] with respect to the delousing process in Auschwitz. That triplet is easily
                        found; however, in his later interview with the Shoah Foundation, he says: “And then they did some – used some kind of delousing agent, they
                        poured all over us.” No triplets were found in the first version of our
                        process, as the sentence is spoken with breaks that less clearly connect the
                        subject (“they”) to the verbs and objects. To address this, our
                        “meticulous” version of triplet extraction is based on a set of
                        finer-defined, semantic rules to extract noun and verb chunks. To make chunks
                        include more contextual information and complete grammatical structures, we add a
                        layer in between the sentence and chunk levels, which we call the “segment
                        level,” for chunk-boundary decision making, as shown in Figure 8. Even
                        though the sentence is not grammatically correct, the new extraction method is
                        able to find the triplets in this sentence, while the previous approach was not.
                        And although some objects and object phrases become longer than expected, we can
                        now extract a more complete context for the objects of a triplet. We are also
                        experimenting with categorizing object phrases based on semantic features like
                        word lemmas, WordNet synsets, and dependency parsing, which will create more
                        filters for large scale triplets retrieval.</div>

                        discussed here, we have applied our “meticulous” method to over a thousand
                        Holocaust testimonies. The output creates a new paratext of triplets for each
                        interview that provides a set of additional metadata that can be queried, indexed,
                        and overlaid on existing metadata. The triplets are intended to function as
                        finding aids to supplement the original text by providing a new set of metadata
                        attuned to articulations of agency. One of the promising directions is to query
                        “shared experiences” (such as reports of and responses to discrimination)
                        across a corpus using the semantic triplets. What, for example, did hundreds of
                        different witnesses say about their memories of discrimination during the 1930s
                        and early 40s and how did they describe their individual reactions? How many other
                        people remember removing the yellow star from their clothes and what did they say
                        they did next? </div>

                        Researchers can then query and visualize through the same interface to find
                        semantic triplets and generate associated networks. This interactive dashboard

                     descriptions of agency within oral histories. While conventional indexing is
                     important for finding overarching themes and topics, it relies on the creation of
                     a
                     secondary scaffolding for searching within the testimonies, almost always attuned
                     to
                     named entities, topics, and general themes. Indexing semantic triplets, on the other
                     hand, is primarily an algorithmic approach to identify specific expressions of agency
                     and their lexical context from transcripts. As such, we are able to link and analyze
                     multiple vectors of action and attune our reading and listening to networks of
                     agents, relations, objects, and contexts. Our approach always relies on and is
                     derived from the interviewee’s spoken (and transcribed) language. In this regard,
                     it
                     is a kind of “algorithmic close reading” built on a paratext derived from the
                     original transcript. Although “distant reading” remains a powerful approach for
                     statistically summarizing the content of a corpus, digital humanities scholars have
                     also warned against the seduction of “delegating observation” and “delegating
                     interpretation” to machines [<a class="ref" href="#underwood2019">Underwood 2019</a>, 157-158]. In
                     many ways, semantic triplets use some of the algorithmic tools of distant reading
                     (large-scale text analysis attuned to patterns, classifications, and clusters) to
                     enable humans to undertake close readings and perform interpretative queries. It is
                     up to us to figure out the meaning or significance of any description of agency in
                     the context of an oral history or corpus.</div>

                     methods for information extraction systems. Although seemingly unpopular these days
                     from a natural language processing perspective, a fully rule-based and easily
                     interpretable system works well for our purposes of triplets extraction and analysis.
                     We can describe the algorithms we use based on conditional statements and clear rules
                     for additional human curation and correction. Computational indexing of agency shifts
                     the scale of analysis to individual mentions of agency and interconnected actions,
                     helping us read and listen to testimonies in ways that deepen our understanding of
                     what people report they did and what was done to them. </div>
