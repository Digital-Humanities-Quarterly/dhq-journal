                  <p>Academic conferences are considered central to the dissemination of research and play
                     a key role in the prestige systems of academia. And yet the organization of these,
                     and the power systems they maintain, have been little discussed. What is a conference
                     supposed to achieve? Who and what is it for? The annual Alliance of Digital Humanities
                     Organization (ADHO)’s Digital Humanities conference is a central occasion in the digital
                     humanities academic calendar, and, as an international, interdisciplinary, regular,
                     long-standing, large-scale event, it provides an ideal locus to consider various
                     aspects of contemporary academic conference organization, and how this impacts the
                     shape and definition of a scholarly field. Examining this annual event allows us to
                     clarify ADHO’s policies and procedures to consider how they frame the digital
                     humanities at large. This paper approaches the annual Digital Humanities conference
                     via a Reflection-in-Action and Reflection-on-Action approach encompassing the experiences
                     of various people
                     formally involved in organizing the conference over the past decade. Considering the
                     last seven years of the conference as well as its broader history, we argue that
                     conferences are central mechanisms for agenda setting and fostering a community of
                     digital humanities practitioners. Through analyses of the selection of Program
                     Committees, the choosing of conference themes, the preparation of calls for papers,
                     the peer review process, and the selection of keynotes, we contend that existing
                     structures and processes inadequately address concerns around representation,
                     diversity, multilingualism, and labor. Our recommendations, including aligning the
                     conference budget with its priorities, fostering fair labor practices, and creating
                     accountability structures will be useful to those organizing future Digital
                     Humanities events, and conference organizers throughout academia interested in making
                     academic conferences more inclusive, welcoming environments that encourage a
                     plurality of voices to fully partake in academic discourse. </p>

                     the one event in the academic calendar at which their research can be appreciated

                     many traditional humanities disciplines makes the conference a place of refuge for
                     some; an opportunity to “nerd out” with like-minded colleagues despite otherwise
                     evident differences in academic backgrounds. The Digital Humanities (DH) conference
                     in this sense has adopted something of a “Big Tent” ethos (indeed, this was the
                     official conference theme of DH2011); it is a meeting site where a wide spectrum of
                     scholarship can be articulated and heard. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">The metaphor of the “Big Tent” has been debated as a defining feature of the
                     digital humanities itself. In one of the earliest of the “Big Tent” reflections,
                     William Pannapacker momentarily switches metaphors to ponder, “The digital humanities may seem like a
                     lifeboat amid the wreckage of higher education in the humanities, but it’s not
                     large enough to hold everyone who’s still in the water”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#pannapacker2011b">Pannapacker 2011b</a>]. For Pannapaker, the question of inclusion
                     at the DH conference is one of “scale” (however impossible that may seem to
                     resolve). But as Ethan Watrall has noted, the issue is also one of “curation” or
                     gatekeeping: “Whatever the perspective
                     on the ‘Big Tent,’ the metaphor has inevitably led to debate as to who is
                     in this ‘tent’ and who is not”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#watrall2016">Watrall 2016</a>]. Watrall focuses his attention on the absence
                     of relevant disciplines, in particular archaeology, at the annual event. Others have
                     taken digital humanities data techniques and applied them to the conference itself
                     to
                     assess just how encompassing the Big Tent really is.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e389">[4]</a>

                     Weingart and Nickoal Eichmann find that, although the conference has consistently
                     grown, this expansion has not necessarily equated to a commensurate increase in the
                     diversity of topics, disciplines, or participants [<a class="ref" href="#weingart_etal2017">Weingart and Eichmann-Kalwara 2017</a>]:</div>

                     humanities, it is critical to reflect on what it is the conference is supposed to

                     humanities conferences emerge with various national, regional, linguistic, thematic,
                     disciplinary, methodological, and other foci, we believe that our international
                     organization should rethink the point of the conference through the perspective of
                     diversity, equity, inclusion and decolonization. Similarly, the conference’s stated
                     purpose for “the benefit of its members and for
                     the advancement of research and scholarship in the variety of disciplines and

                     [<a class="ref" href="#adhoc">ADHO n.d. “Conference”</a>] is overdue for a reconsideration that centers justice rather
                     than merit, equity rather than innovation, polyvocality rather than canons,
                     differences rather than standards, and inclusion rather than gatekeeping. This
                     article provides guidelines as a basis for future conference organizers to shape
                     upcoming conferences.</div>

                     nationality.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e442">[5]</a> Further, an approach to conference
                     organizing based on these principles would also clarify what position the ADHO
                     conference occupies in the growing (and sometimes conflicting) ecology of digital
                     humanities conferences. To allow “Digital Cultural
                     Empowerment” (DH2014), to encourage “Global Digital
                     Humanities” (DH2015), to address “Digital Identities:
                     the Past and the Future” (DH2016), to provide “Access/Accès” (DH2017), to build “Bridges/Puentes” (DH2018), to consider “Complexities” (DH2019), to meet at “Carrefours/Intersections” (DH2020): these official themes of DH
                     conferences past all speak in support of the principles that we advocate here, but
                     that we argue have been implemented inconsistently and with varying degrees of
                     success. The realities of the conference processes do not always align with the
                     themes.</div>

                     motivations, the conference suffers high levels of inaccessibility, language
                     restrictions, poor distribution of knowledge and lost research. The cost of the

                     give up valuable years of an academic life to deliver an event of limited or
                     uncertain personal and community benefit. Indeed it might be argued that the real,
                     underlying work that the conference does is to create curriculum vitae lines that

                     conference protocols and processes. The conference protocols, which are bureaucratic
                     documents established to guide the conference process, outline workflows and encode
                     the principles of the organization. The essay generally follows the temporal flow
                     of
                     the conference organization process, but a number of crucial value-based themes
                     (probably the most central themes of this essay) are woven throughout:
                     multilingualism; equity, representation, and diversity; visibility and labor issues;
                     and others. We start with a brief presentation of these themes, then point back to
                     them throughout the essay as they arise in the course of conference organization.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p10">While some aspects of the international DH conference exist because they have been
                     thoughtfully decided by multiple committees, other elements are retained because of
                     past practice. There is an assumption written into the conference processes that
                     conference committee members, authors, and participants are familiar with the
                     protocols and will be held to them equally. The reality is that few are familiar with
                     the protocols at the level needed to have a seamless conference process. A lack of
                     transparency in how ADHO and its conference works is also deeply felt by many digital
                     humanities community members. Although efforts have been made to remediate a general
                     lack of understanding of just how ADHO functions, this continues to be an issue. This
                     essay challenges us to reflect not only on past practice but also on what should be
                     carried forward — and what changes could be made to better reflect the values
                     discussed here. Throughout the essay, we detail how issues such as equity around
                     gender and representation, and multilingualism play out within the ADHO Digital
                     Humanities conference space. We recognize that these two threads are not inclusive
                     of
                     all forms of equity and representation including race, ability, sexuality, ethnicity,
                     class and all the intersectional dimensions of these that are articulated in the
                     conference process. However, multilingualism and gender have received extensive
                     attention from ADHO officers, conference organizers, and attendees. As such, we
                     launch our analysis by positing that equity, particularly gender equity and
                     multilingual representation, are not questions of proportional representation where
                     the conference should reflect gender “balance” or “proportional”
                     participation from the various multilingual constituencies. Rather, conference
                     organizers should discuss what constitutes gender equity and make the results of that
                     conversation public. Equity should, of course, be based on reparative action and
                     restorative approaches to conference organization. These actions and approaches would
                     require identification of all who have been harmed in previous conference work,
                     conference attendance, and the spheres of influence created through conference
                     processes. </div>

                     work diligently to create a scholarly community and an international conference that
                     reflect the current trends and advances in scholarship. This article recognizes this
                     scholarly labor while also pointing to the structural challenges that these
                     volunteers face. It suggests that conference organizing is not merely an act of
                     service but is a scholarly activity that should be treated as such. From this
                     perspective, then, we are obligated to study and critique the conference as a site
                     of
                     cultural production. The issues we discuss here are grounded in the digital
                     humanities but speak to broader academic practice within academic conferences.
                     Acknowledging these complicated challenges is the first step to rectifying them in
                     order to create an equitable and welcoming environment for conference organizers and

                     needed (although many chose to remain anonymous). A coordinated writing sprint

                     people each year, who are involved in a complex committee structure that is governed
                     by a conference organizing protocol. As Márton Demeter points out, “conference organizers and committees”
                     are “collective agents,”
                     “in the sense that they have an impact, or

                     revised conference protocol on their site that outlines some of the workflow towards
                     the conference [<a class="ref" href="#adhocp">ADHO n.d. “Conference Protocol”</a>]. The conference organization is as follows: a
                     group of people write a proposal to host the conference; these bids are vetted by

                     organization’s leadership proposes two Program Committee (PC) chairs who have to be
                     approved by the Conference Coordinating Committee and ADHO governing boards; until
                     2017 there was a single PC chair per conference. At least one of these individuals

                     are in charge of the budget (including sponsorship), receptions, venues, excursions,
                     website, and other details such as ensuring accessibility, keynote translation, etc.
                     The Program Committee handles the creation of the call for papers, selection of
                     keynotes (with approval by the Local Organizers),<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e647">[10]</a> peer
                     reviewing the academic program, scheduling the academic program, and publishing the
                     selected proceedings. While this list of tasks might seem a simple division of labor,
                     in practice, there are many gray areas, such as coordinating the publication of the
                     book of abstracts which is separate from a proceedings volume of full essays. Many
                     conference elements — for instance, coordinating special interest group (SIG)
                     workshops require the Local Organizers to work closely with the program committee
                     chairs. Cooperation, communication, and goodwill between the Local Organizers (LO)
                     and Program Committee (PC) chairs is essential and each conference entails subtle
                     variations in how tasks are negotiated and allocated between them. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p20">Further, the conference is facilitated by the “backstage” volunteer labor of
                     hundreds of digital humanists who lend both their digital humanities expertise and
                     their linguistic and scholarly capacities as reviewers and attendees. Little
                     attention is given to the volunteerism that is required to organize, facilitate, and
                     ultimately complete a full conference cycle. Committee members, chairs, reviewers,
                     moderators, on-site staffing, etc. are each essential to realizing the conference.
                     Yet, there is little to no attention paid to how this unpaid labor structure is
                     enacted, inscribes inequities, alters career trajectories, and impacts personal
                     lives. </div>

                     representative. Yet, the lack of standardization of organizations within ADHO creates
                     two intertwined problems: 1) the conflation of diverse perspectives within individual
                     associations because of the limitations on representation and 2) the lack of
                     perspectives beyond those held by those already reflected within a constituent

                     reflect those of one’s organization? Additionally, what exactly is one’s duty on the
                     program committee? Is it to read and review submissions? Set policies related to the
                     academic program? Establish the conference schedule? These and many other questions
                     arise with the installation of the program committee and its members.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p22">We offer a few brief examples of how these problems play out when the current PC
                     structure mirrors ADHO’s constituent organization structure. On the one hand, one
                     of
                     ADHO’s constituent organizations, the European Association of Digital Humanities
                     (EADH) spans an entire multilingual and multicultural continent yet only has one or
                     two representatives. This flattens the differences and competing interests among the
                     scholars inside the association that might present unique perspectives. EADH itself
                     is comprised of associate and partner organizations, including national societies
                     such as the <a href="http://www.aiucd.it/" onclick="window.open('http://www.aiucd.it/'); return false" class="ref">Associazione Informatica Umanistica e

                     has many voices often represented as one. On the other hand, ADHO has multiple
                     nationally-based societies as the <a href="https://csdh-schn.org/" onclick="window.open('https://csdh-schn.org/'); return false" class="ref">Canadian

                        Digital Humanities</a> (TADH), which are smaller organizations with fewer
                     members. While equal representation ensures a balance of power in decision-making,
                     it
                     does not allow for nuanced representation of the differing communities and interests
                     that might diverge from the majority position within an organization. The lack of
                     nuance, particularly of representation of those who are not represented by a
                     constituent organization, undercuts the values articulated by ADHO.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p23">Two organizations represented on the program committee are not formally based on
                     national or continental borders: <a href="https://dhcenternet.org/" onclick="window.open('https://dhcenternet.org/'); return false" class="ref">CenterNet</a> (which represents digital humanities centers) and <a href="http://www.humanisti.ca/" onclick="window.open('http://www.humanisti.ca/'); return false" class="ref">Humanistica</a> (which unites francophone
                     digital humanists from around the world). Ultimately, however, both CenterNet and
                     Humanistica are almost always represented by well-established scholars from North
                     America or Europe. In part, this is because the barrier to participation in CenterNet
                     is not just having a center but it is also having the local financial resources to
                     support CenterNet membership. For newly-established centers or those whose existence
                     are locally precarious, the likelihood that a non-Western early-career-scholar based
                     at a digital humanities center can both be a member of CenterNet and would be
                     selected for this service is quite low. Humanistica offers a similar challenge in
                     that much of the association’s membership is concentrated in North America and Europe
                     rather than French-speaking regions outside North America and Europe. As a result,
                     representation from non-geographically-based organizations amplifies representation
                     of interests in those geographical regions.</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p24">24</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p24">We note, furthermore, that the program committee is heavily weighted towards faculty
                     representation from established academic institutions and with already recognized
                     professional trajectories. Part of this may lie in the issues of workload and labor
                     where those in precarious positions or without seniority may not be able to fully
                     participate because of the unfunded nature of the work. This is, after all, how the
                     academy works generally. But within digital humanities, it may also be a result of
                     being able to situate yourself within the organization previously. Those without
                     records of participation or active long-term investment in digital humanities
                     leadership may struggle to gather the needed support to be appointed to the position.
                     This tendency has implications for the program committee’s ethnic representation as
                     well, given the dire statistics on race, gender, and the academy. For example, it
                     wasn’t until 2018 that a woman of color occupied the co-chair position in the program
                     committee for the first time. Importantly, though, the appointment deviated from ADHO
                     procedures. DH2018 was the “first to be organised ‘outside’
                     ADHO,” noted Karina van Dalem-Oskam, chair of the Steering
                     Committee.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e705">[13]</a>
                     Thus Élika Ortega was appointed explicitly in a “non-voting vice
                     chair in an advisory role,” a position created by ADHO’s Steering Committee
                     — the first, and only such appointment. It was only later that Ortega, a junior
                     scholar, was granted the title of “co-chair” with decision-making and voting
                     authority equal to that of Glen Worthey, her white, male, senior colleague.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e712">[14]</a> Additionally, the
                     long duration of the appointments — generally 24 months minimum — makes participation
                     by those occupying staff and non-faculty positions particularly challenging. When
                     committee members are not appointed by the beginning of the two-year term, it impacts
                     the functionality of the program committee. As Manfred Thaller notes in his official
                     report, DH2016 struggled with the constituent organizations’ late-appointments of
                     program committee members less than a year prior to the conference which meant there
                     wasn’t sufficient time to determine collective conference priorities for the
                     program.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e718">[15]</a> The adoption of at-large
                     positions is one potential way forward that might address issues of rank, diversity,
                     and representation beyond the academy by allowing anyone within the digital
                     humanities community the opportunity to serve. But so too would addressing the need
                     for compensation for the work of the program committee. Solving structural imbalances
                     in the composition of the program committee goes beyond the conference program
                     committee and its chairs, but needs to be acknowledged in the conference’s decision
                     making processes.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p25">Although conference themes might not initially seem as important as logistical
                     factors of venue, budget, and local resources that are taken into consideration as
                     much when teams bid to host the conference, we believe them to be crucial as guiding
                     principles in decision making processes. For example, the theme of the 2018
                     conference, “Bridges/Puentes,” strongly influenced the
                     crafting of the call for papers (CfP) and the inclusion of topics such as the
                     collaborative relationships between scholars from the Global North and the Global
                     South; different practices and epistemologies across geopolitical realities, and
                     others. Similarly, this theme guided the gathering of presentations over the basis
                     of
                     a shared topic, approach, or methodology rather than by language as it was
                     historically done. This yielded, for example, a session in art history with
                     presentations in English, Spanish, and Portuguese, instead of, for instance, a
                     session in Spanish on a multitude of topics. In addition to being hosted in a large
                     French-speaking city, DH2017’s theme “Access/Accès” also
                     signaled the bilingualism of the conference which included not only a French language
                     keynote, but also sessions where all the presentations were in French. Likewise,
                     DH2020’s theme “Carrefours/Intersections” signaled the
                     conference’s commitment to emphasizing and supporting French-language digital
                     humanities scholarship, reflecting “the
                     geographical and cultural heritage of Ottawa, a bilingual city in unceded
                     Algonquin territory”

                     first choices made about a conference, are one way that the conference signals its

                  <div class="ptext" id="p26">While much of the content of the CfP is mandated by policy, the conference theme is
                     handled separately. At the time of bidding for the conference, the local organizers
                     select a theme that resonates either locally with their digital humanities community
                     or that they feel best serves the interest of the digital humanities communities at
                     large. That theme is shared with the executive committee of ADHO and can be subtly
                     shifted based on their feedback. As a result, the theme is often prescribed for the
                     Program Committee prior to its creation. This can cause tension within the Program
                     Committee as the theme should guide the academic program; yet the representatives
                     appointed to the Program Committee have no authority to change or revise the theme.
                     In the best scenario, the local organizers consult with the Program Committee after
                     their appointment on explanations and definitions of the theme that will be
                     incorporated into the call for papers. At the end of the 2018 conference, DH2019
                     announced the main theme of “Complexities” which “suits the very diverse situation in Europe and
                     DH at large, and captures the challenge to develop across regions and represent
                     more inclusive, global perspectives on scholarship and teaching”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#dh2019cfpe">DH2019 n.d. “CfP English”</a>]. Local organizers then launched a parallel theme of
                     “Focus on Africa”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#dh2019foa">DH2019 n.d. “Focus on Africa”</a>] that was intended to build on their existing
                     collaborations with African scholars. While they noted that this was an effort to
                     “help open up the conference to scholars
                     from an area that is still very much underrepresented in the DH community,”
                     concerns quickly arose around cost of attendance, that scholarships would only partly
                     cover costs of travel and attendance, and that participants in the Africa workshop
                     were somehow outside the main conference process. It did not help that the
                     announcement was “clumsy” as program chairs noted. It also
                     was problematic that the workshop was discussed as a “satellite” event rather than part of the conference proper and began a
                     full week prior to the conference workshops (thereby increasing housing and meal
                     costs for attendees who hoped to attend both). One digital humanist noted their
                     skepticism on “how a ‘Focus on Africa’ will
                     really empower underrepresented communities”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#krautli2019">Kräutli 2019</a>]. Another attendee noted via twitter that there were
                     “few perspectives from Africa on
                     Africa” at the conference [<a class="ref" href="#kandeh2019">Kandeh 2019</a>]. The carving-off of a
                     portion of conference events to a separate event is not unique to 2019. Indeed, there
                     is a track record of portions of the conference program being isolated from the main
                     conference including being held in separate buildings by themselves (2016’s panel
                     on

                     co-drafted a document explaining the theme which was then discussed, modified, and
                     endorsed by both full committees. The collaborative work on the theme helped ensure
                     that no committee saw it as an imposition. Given the broad range of digital
                     humanities topics and interests, the theme is a way to narrow the selection of
                     possible keynote presenters as well as to signal to potential presenters topics that
                     they might engage with. Most themes incorporate a set of sub-themes or topics. This
                     can take the form of bullet-pointed lists or, as 2020 did, a set of values statements
                     around selected sub-disciplines: of digital first nations and indigenous studies;
                     public digital humanities; and open data. Rather than articulate all of these details
                     in the main CfP, DH2020 elected to publish a conference themes document on the
                     conference website that provided an explanation of each sub-discipline and its
                     relationship to the topic of “Carrefours”

                     and outlined capacious definitions so potential presenters could position their
                     ongoing work within the theme. For DH2020, the program committee had planned to go
                     forward with three themed special journal issues that would reflect each of the areas
                     outlined, however, because of COVID-19, the Ottawa conference did not take place;
                     as
                     such, neither did the special issues that would have emerged from that gathering.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p28">As the most recognized annual international conference in digital humanities, the
                     DH
                     conference also welcomes presentations on ongoing research regardless of its
                     connection to the conference’s theme. This manifests a tension between submissions
                     that adhere to the conference theme and those that do not. It is the determination
                     of
                     the program committee what value, if any, to assign submissions that align to the
                     theme. For DH2020, the program committee, in consultation with the local organizers,
                     conference coordinating committee, and executive board, chose to weight the theme
                     as
                     ten percent of the consideration for peer reviewing applications. The Program
                     Committee wished to directly acknowledge the three sub-disciplinary areas as vital
                     to
                     the intellectual breadth and depth of the conference. Part of the rationale for this
                     was the local appeal to scholars working on these topics; chairs also wanted the
                     digital humanities community to consider these sub-disciplines as a coherent set of
                     interests. The decision to weight “theme” at ten percent was ultimately
                     frustrating for both the Program Committee and the submitters. A handful of
                     individuals pushed back against measuring submissions in relation to theme,
                     preferring a nominal theme that is not actually considered in relation to
                     submissions. In some cases, the discontent stemmed from long-standing digital
                     humanists not seeing their research interests reflected in the three sub-disciplines
                     chosen for that year’s conference; others noted that past practice had not evaluated
                     submissions in relation to conference themes. This concern was expressed in direct
                     emails from participants and peer reviewers as well as in peer reviewers’ uneven
                     deployment of the category “relation to theme” from the peer review rubric.
                     Uneven evaluative actions were not reserved for thematic weighting alone; previous
                     Program Committees have expressed similar sentiments about evaluation in other
                     categories. The rubric (including the criteria on which submissions were evaluated
                     and their weight) was circulated in advance so that everyone submitting could tailor
                     their applications accordingly. Yet, attempts to align submission abstracts to review
                     criteria varied widely. </div>

                     Committee will need to decide on the value and purpose of having a themed conference,
                     or perhaps decide to jettison the notion of themes altogether. While the first would
                     make it easier for submitters and the program committee to complete their work, the
                     lack of a theme may guide the conference away from coherence. For scholars invested
                     in emerging fields that are reflected in the sub-themes, the loss of the opportunity
                     for the larger digital humanities community to consider their importance can be quite
                     damaging. Ultimately, conference themes such as DH2011’s “Big
                     Tent Digital Humanities,” can spawn debate, affect public discourse beyond
                     the conference itself, and may have long lasting reverberations.</div>

                     spikes for organizations who are supporting the conference occuring in their

                     such as racial, gender, representation, or status balance on panels or forums? Does
                     it welcome submissions by those outside academic ranks? Each of these questions

                     process is prescribed and supervised by ADHO’s Conference Coordinating Committee
                     (CCC). The CCC provides to every program committee a template that outlines not just
                     what content should be included in the CfP but also the placement of elements within
                     the CfP in relation to one another. It is guided by the “Conference Protocols”
                     which were created in order to standardize conference procedures from year to year
                     and also to help organizers, who come to the position new each year. The conference
                     is organized on a rolling basis. As such, at any given time, there are three
                     conference planning groups running: the current conference process, the past
                     conference teams as they close out their activities such as publishing proceedings,
                     and future conference groups who are learning about the activities they will need
                     to
                     participate in. While there is overlap in representation from the same organizations,
                     very rarely is there overlap with the individual members assigned. As such,
                     conference protocols are designed to reduce potential errors or issues, both known
                     and unknown, for organizers, committee members, and participants as they move through
                     one of the three stages. Manfred Thaller noted that “the
                     relationship between [the program committee and the conference coordinating
                     committee] has been rather vaguely
                     defined” [<a class="ref" href="#thaller2016">Thaller 2016</a>] , particularly in
                     relation to when the PC needs to seek approval from the CCC. He further highlights
                     the inconsistency of involvement of the chair of the conference coordinating
                     committee in supervising program committee work. In 2019, Diane Jakacki and Brian
                     Croxall, chairs of the Conference Coordinating Committee, undertook the task of
                     rewriting the conference protocols: the new protocols were to be applied to the 2021
                     conference (which, due to COVID-19, has been pushed back a year); yet, even with
                     ongoing revisions to the protocols, the ongoing debate over the relationship between
                     the conference coordinating committee, the local organizing committee, and the
                     program committee continues. The kinds of questions covered by the conference
                     protocols include: What types of presentations will the conference have? Is there
                     a
                     conference theme or set of topics that will guide conference interests? How will
                     submissions be reviewed? By whom will the program ultimately be decided? While these
                     may seem simple mechanistic questions that are formulaic, the reality is that each
                     of
                     these questions is situated within a set of conventions that implicitly and
                     explicitly communicate disciplinary standards and value-systems. Every member who
                     participates in the process brings with them their own disciplinary and personal
                     predispositions to organizing the conference. </div>

                     deadline dates, the introduction of new formats or criteria for submission, or the
                     excision of elements from the template, have to be reviewed and approved by the CCC
                     who generally consult with the Executive officers. The ADHO CfP is created each year
                     by the program committee, whose chairs and members change for every conference. Each
                     program committee draws on previous years’ CfPs: as you can see from the appended
                     calls from 2015-2020, some sections were retained over the years. This was a
                     purposeful policy on ADHO’s part in order to minimize the labor of translating the
                     call into multiple languages; however, it also constrained program committees from
                     innovation, acknowledging the rapid changes in the field, or even addressing existing
                     challenges. So, for example in 2015, the program committee was expressly forbidden
                     from varying the CfP in their content or structure. Translation of new material would
                     be too costly and time-consuming; this despite the fact that ADHO does not fund
                     translation activities and that program chairs often must use their own personal
                     resources to fund translation. Coupled with this, in 2015, even without variation
                     to
                     the CfP, there were no translators available for some languages. Translation may also
                     be limited at the request of local organizers. In 2019, local organizers declined
                     to
                     have the call for papers translated into Dutch claiming that “most of the academic communication in the
                     Netherlands happens in English”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#ciotti_etal2019">Ciotti and Pierazzo 2019</a>]. While this was likely correct, the question of
                     whether the lack of translation to Dutch limited potential contributions from those
                     outside the English-speaking academic community remained unanswered.</div>

                     of the protocols limiting the expansion of the reviewer pool to a biannual process
                     despite need for new reviewers, as well as mandating a process of <em class="term">review
                        bidding</em> that was implemented to encourage participation by reviewers, but
                     may have had unintended negative consequences, such as favoritism. For example, most
                     of the procedural changes implemented for DH2018 in Mexico City (e.g., expanding the
                     reviewer pool during an “off-cycle” year; abandoning the review bidding phase;
                     and moving to double-anonymous peer review) were motivated specifically by the desire
                     to make space for scholars from Latin America in the program. The existing approved
                     review pool had limited Spanish-speaking reviewers so an expansion of the pool was
                     clearly in order; Latin American scholars who had previously submitted to the
                     conference had received hostile or uncollegial reviews. Moving to an expanded pool
                     of
                     reviewers and the double-anonymous review process was intended to alleviate those

                     both a manual and automatic review assignment process [<a class="ref" href="#conftool">ConfTool n.d. “Automatic Review”</a>].
                     ConfTool is a commercial service that ADHO licenses each year. Every year, the
                     previous year’s ConfTool database is imported into a new ConfTool instance, a
                     functionality that has advantages for organizers and participants. Past participants
                     don’t need to create a new login account or state their review expertise topics;
                     organizers have a ready-made mailing list and review information already available
                     to
                     the program committee. Carrying over this database, however, also reiterates outdated
                     user information (such as the use of deadnames, that is, original birth names after
                     an individual has altered their name) as well as biases (listing some subfields and
                     not others) that may have been incorporated in previous conference processes. For
                     example, there may be missing expertise fields, scholars may not update their
                     expertise to align to new areas of work, or there may be reviewers who remain within
                     the reviewer pool despite issues around code of conduct. Noting below how ConfTool
                     shapes the organization and the DH conference, we are also aware that every
                     conference management tool will have its own issues. However, there has been no
                     systematic evaluation of how ConfTool structures affect decision-making,
                     organization, labor issues, and other crucial conference functions.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p36">In ConfTool, once all submissions have been received with keywords selected and all
                     reviewers have been marked with reviewer status, the automatic assignment system
                     identifies conflicts of interests between submissions and potential reviewers. When
                     conflicts have been identified, the algorithm tries to find “the best reviewers for each paper (so not the best papers for each
                     reviewer)”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#conftool">ConfTool n.d. “Automatic Review”</a>]. In some years, this includes considering reviewer
                     preferences (known as the “bidding process”) for particular review assignments.
                     Most years, though, the algorithm moves directly to “matching topics according to the areas of expertise”
                     (counting down from the highest number of matches to one, e.g., five, four, three,
                     two, one matches between areas of expertise and topics selected by the authors).
                     Finally, the algorithm attempts to assign to those with the fewest number of reviews
                     assigned to a given reviewer. While this sounds logical, the algorithm is limited
                     in
                     three key ways. First, the algorithm does not accommodate submissions and reviewer
                     expertise outside of the English language. Thus, you cannot assign Spanish-language
                     submissions, for example, only to reviewers who are fluent in Spanish. Instead, you
                     must manually match those with multilingual expertise to those submissions that are
                     in that language adding significant labor to the work of program chairs. Second,
                     complicating manual assignment is that ConfTool has no specific mechanism for
                     differentiating the language of presentation from the content of the submission. As
                     a
                     result, program chairs have to incorporate language proficiency in the default user
                     profiles and then manually match that information to the topical fields related to
                     language. Because many authors either fail to mark the language of presentation,
                     assume that the system will automatically identify multilingual submissions, or
                     confuse the topic of research (on Mexico, for example) with the desire to submit and
                     present in Spanish, program chairs either must review all submissions to ensure the
                     correct languages are selected or, as most program chairs have done, manually assign
                     all non-English submissions first outside the algorithmic assignment process. While
                     in some languages there may only be a handful of submissions, depending on the year
                     and location the number of non-English submissions can be quite large. This leads
                     to
                     the third problem which is that there is no way to weight or sequence the algorithm
                     processing of topical keywords. Program chairs cannot prioritize matching linguistic
                     proficiencies first before topics such as discipline or geography. As a result, the
                     algorithm may identify a high match of four or five topics and none of them relate
                     to
                     linguistic ability resulting in a reviewer being unable to review a submission. While
                     individually these issues can be resolved through creative solutions and human
                     engineering, the underlying issue of the algorithm illustrates an English bias that
                     undermines diversity efforts. Given the international nature of the conference, the
                     inability of the ConfTool system to accommodate multilingualism and complexity in
                     reviewer assignment and submission information is quite problematic. As Elena
                     Pierazzo and Fabio Ciotti noted in their 2019 chairs report, “no automatic system will solve all the
                     problems, nor an absolute and mechanic reliance on external peer review is
                     acceptable in all cases”

                  <div class="ptext" id="p37">The manual assignment of reviewers and the expansion of the multilingual reviewer
                     pool are invisible to most but are key for the success of the review process. These
                     two efforts can have positive repercussions in the acceptance of proposals that under
                     different review bodies with particular merit standards might not be ranked
                     positively, in the overall composition of the program, and ultimately in the overall
                     proceedings of the conference. Difficulties to enact changes such as these include
                     making proposals to the CCC that justify a deviation from the protocols and usages
                     at
                     the time. That is in addition to the work of reaching out to reviewers, vetting them,
                     and maintaining good communication. These are challenges for every conference but
                     are
                     especially pressing for conferences being hosted for the first time by a member
                     association. DH2018, the first to take place in the Global South, was especially
                     burdened as missteps in the conference process would impact both future hosting
                     abilities as well as the potential growth of local membership.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p38">For many years, the standard modality of peer review for the international DH
                     conference was single-anonymous: anonymous reviewers were able to see the names of
                     proposal authors. This practice not only was fairly non-standard in academia, but
                     also entailed a lack of balance and equity between reviewers and submission authors
                     [<a class="ref" href="#okike_etal2016">Okike et al 2016</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#tompkins_etal2017">Tompkins, Zhang, and Heavlin 2017</a>]. Although at
                     various times, single-anonymous reviewing was questioned in the ADHO community, there
                     was considerable resistance (and perhaps marginal or marginalized motivation) to
                     change it. Because participants in the conference come from varied institutional,
                     geographic, and disciplinary backgrounds, however, many people bring different
                     expectations for peer review to the conference itself.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p39">Changes to the single-anonymous model have been used to try to mitigate these
                     concerns, which were widely, if too often quietly, acknowledged by conference
                     organizers, delegates, and other practitioners. Uncollegial and outright rude review
                     tone, implicit bias, and inappropriate deference to “stardom” were known
                     problems for years. In DH2018, for example, the shift to double-anonymous peer review
                     helped prevent both the implicit negative biases that might arise from a reviewer
                     reacting to a linguistically or culturally coded author’s name or from an
                     institutional affiliation. It also addressed an unconscious (or perhaps conscious)
                     positive bias in response to seeing a very well-known author. Some of these biases
                     were further exacerbated by the <em class="term">review bidding</em> phase where potential
                     reviewers had the chance to choose what and whose work to evaluate (this practice
                     between 2013 and 2017 has been abandoned). The problem of uncollegial tone in reviews
                     was sadly not resolved by the double-anonymous approach for 2018. However,
                     double-anonymous peer review did have an impact in closing the scoring gaps between
                     well-known scholars and newcomers to the conference for both DH2018 and DH2019. Fabio
                     Ciotti and Elena Pierazzo noted that double anonymous “seems to lower the authority bias and help
                     younger and less known scholars to get good scores.”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#ciotti_etal2019">Ciotti and Pierazzo 2019</a>] DH2019 did, however, experience issues around the
                     anonymity of submissions. Some authors failed to properly anonymize their
                     contributions while others were overly-anonymized by limiting access to websites and
                     other supporting citations that might strengthen their contributions [<a class="ref" href="#ciotti_etal2019">Ciotti and Pierazzo 2019</a>]. DH2020 enacted open peer review where both the
                     reviewer and submitter names were known to each other and to the program committee
                     (but reviews were not publicly posted). DH2020’s open peer review was met with both
                     criticism and praise. Some participants in the digital humanities conference are
                     committed to only undertaking open peer review, whereas others can be skeptical of
                     its scholarly rigor. Future program committees will need to judiciously choose their
                     peer review modality (open, single-anonymous, or double-anonymous); and, regardless
                     of the style of peer reviewing selected, will need to work to ensure that the review
                     process does not simply reinforce existing biases and axes of privilege that cut
                     across the conference and community.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p40">The selection process and the making of the program is the stage of the conference
                     where the Program Committee exerts the most power and situates a year’s conference
                     in
                     regards to the field. Although the selection process might seem to be a mechanical
                     one where a “cutoff point” in scoring separates accepted proposals from those
                     not accepted, in reality, this exercise involves a large degree of give and take.
                     There are a variety of factors that must necessarily guide the process including the
                     number of submissions in various presentation categories (poster, panel, long or
                     short paper, etc.); physical limitations of the venue; temporal limitations of the
                     conference calendar; diversity of participants (discipline and approach; career
                     stage; geographical, linguistic, and cultural background). The merit and quality of
                     a
                     proposal may be perceived to be the deciding factors, as though the selection process
                     was a competition and acceptance to the conference was the prize, one that could
                     signal membership to the digital humanities community and room in the “Big
                     Tent.” Complicating the question of acceptance is the rapidly increasing scale
                     of the conference which has seen exponential growth in both the number of submissions
                     and the number of individuals involved in the conference process through reviewing.
                     DH2015, for example, as the table below outlines, saw 426 submissions with 371
                     approved reviewers. DH2019, just four years later, saw 893 submissions with an active
                     reviewer pool of 661 individuals.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e939">[19]</a>

                     arguing for the quality of a proposal, the precedent of having been accepted in
                     previous years, or, from another stance, the gatekeeping of the field and the lack
                     of
                     diversity. As has been proven, merit in the academy is not an equitable measurement
                     of success or rewards, but rather a skewed one where resources are allocated to those
                     who already have them. Thus, an assumption of the fairness of rewarding merit can
                     only lead to a feedback loop where success is granted only (or mostly) to those who
                     are already successful [<a class="ref" href="#weingart2016">Weingart 2016</a>]. Should merit then be centered
                     as the deciding factor of acceptance? We contend that it shouldn’t. Instead, program
                     committees should prioritize a deliberate curatorial approach: a local language,
                     under-recognized academic approaches, justice and equity, etc. Conference themes
                     (discussed above) might assist in that effort; however, without thematic alignment
                     being represented in the review criteria, thematic efforts might be ignored. A look
                     at the history of the conference offers examples of both.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p42">In 2018, for example, the program co-chairs centered the location of the conference,
                     which afforded many digital humanists in Latin America the possibility of attending
                     due to proximity, fewer (or no) visa requirements, and lower costs, in their curation
                     of the program. Rather than relying on the metrics of merit (scoring) alone, the
                     program chairs focused on ensuring that the percentage of presentations accepted
                     from practitioners based in Latin America roughly matched the percentage of
                     submissions initially received from the region. This labor was strongly facilitated
                     by the work already done by the reviewers who not only had various linguistic and
                     disciplinary backgrounds, but also, crucially, came from varied academic cultures
                     so
                     that a single notion of merit, quality, or value did not dominate. Perhaps
                     unsurprisingly, the single notion that dominated prior efforts in addressing inequity
                     in review was the centering of tenure-track and tenured faculty who sought to uphold
                     the privilege of degree, access to publication venues, and the reification of
                     citational privilege. As the 2018 chairs learned from this example, evaluation must
                     not only deal with linguistic competency, but must also consider cultural,
                     contextual, and citational practices fairly. We suggest that there is no innate,
                     universal knowledge that all scholars should have; rather, we are suggesting that
                     the
                     notion of what is appropriate academic practice varies greatly and can be weaponized
                     against those who are not engaged with North American and European digital humanities
                     as led by the tenured and those on the tenure track.</div>

                     acceptance, in practicality members of the ADHO Executive have had significant
                     interest in acceptance rates. For instance, in 2020, ADHO provided suggested baseline
                     thresholds for acceptance and rejection without examining the submissions or their
                     reviews; in 2015, there was significant tension around acceptance rates given the
                     venue location (Sydney, Australia). Further, there is a disconnect between the desire
                     by ADHO to maintain a stance of exclusivity in relationship to acceptance and
                     rejection rates and the inverse desire for the conference to serve as a gathering
                     opportunity for the entirety of the field that generates revenue. There are
                     significant financial implications to exclusivity as it limits the potential income
                     of the conference. As conference income is dispersed among the member organizations,
                     choices to cap the number of presenters also limit the amount of disbursements to
                     organizations in the year following. This can then directly impact the constituent
                     organizations and their activities.</div>

                     crafting of the program has important ramifications for the scholarly dialogue not
                     just across disciplines, methodologies, but also academic cultures. All conferences
                     are exclusionary in some way. But awareness of that exclusion needs to be not only
                     attended to but also openly addressed where possible. Successive Digital Humanities
                     conferences have consistently attempted to just add more concurrent sessions as if
                     that would address issues of exclusion and merit; yet, in our experience and
                     analysis, additional sessions do not necessarily translate into a more diverse
                     conference program, rather it provides more opportunities to those already centered
                     within the field. Ultimately, centering specific disciplines, themes, or locales can
                     offer new points of departure for our initial questions, what is the conference

                     the early 1900s, the noun has been used as a verb to describe presentations which
                     set
                     the prevailing tone or essential ideas of a meeting [<a class="ref" href="#oed2021b">OED 2021b</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#kelly2016">Kelly 2016</a>]. Built into the very idea of the keyote then, is a sense of

                     speakers. A keynote speaker is expected to represent leadership in a given field,
                     signaling both evident accomplishment and simultaneously pointing to the directions
                     that the discipline (and more specifically the conference) might follow. Keynotes
                     are
                     a matter-of-course event within the format of many intellectual meetings. Yet there
                     have been few analyses undertaken of either the selection or content of keynote
                     speeches, and how they both signify and enact prestige, power, hierarchy, and

                     manifold fields such as the Digital Humanities there is a tradition of inviting two
                     to three (and in some years up to five) keynote speakers to cover developments in
                     the
                     many distinct strands of research undertaken by the scholarly community. Typically,
                     a
                     keynote address is delivered by a soloist and there is no competing program event
                     to
                     distract conference attendees. The presenter is expected to speak authoritatively
                     on
                     their area of expertise for forty to forty-five minutes with a short opportunity for

                  <div class="ptext" id="p47">The selection of ADHO keynote speakers is one of the first and one of the trickiest
                     tasks of the conference programming committee after CfP creation for a number of
                     reasons. In order to attract keynote speakers the conference covers travel,
                     accommodation and registration fees. As there is no guarantee that the speaker(s)
                     desired most by the Program Committee will agree, the complex logistics of these
                     arrangements require invitations to be sent early. The announcement of keynote
                     speakers is crucial in promoting the conference and attracting attendees — the
                     earlier they are confirmed the higher the potential impact on the budget that pays
                     their way by encouraging registration of potential attendees. The proposed keynotes
                     are then required to satisfy both the expectations of the programming committee (to
                     be of sufficient academic standing in relation to the conference themes and lines
                     of
                     enquiry) and the local organizers (to be sufficiently recognizable to market the
                     conference and generate registrations). This can give rise to delicate, and not
                     always harmonious, negotiations between the Chair(s) of the Programming Committee
                     and
                     the Local Organizer(s). The intensity of these negotiations are directly proportional
                     to the stakes for the organizers which extend beyond the terms of the conference
                     itself. For example, there are implicit career and professional network benefits to
                     conference organizers in a position to offer keynotes to more senior and influential
                     figures in the field. Often organizers garner individual or small group type
                     activities with speakers that can foster collaboration or reciprocal invitations.
                     There can also be a sense of obligation to invite specific individuals based at the
                     university hosting the conference or located in the country in which it takes place.
                     Not inviting a leading figure at one’s university or national network can have
                     professional consequences. There are also professional opportunities for invited
                     keynotes that they might otherwise not have. These types of presentations for tenure,
                     or promotion, are taken as an indicator of value and prestige within the academic
                     system. Often, speakers will then be invited to give additional talks at other
                     conferences and institutions by those in attendance as a result of having seen them
                     speak.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e1786">[21]</a> There is, then, a significant
                     amount of power in both the choosing of academic speakers and also for those who
                     accept to speak: the allocation of this power dynamic has hitherto been underexplored
                     in digital humanities.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p48">The strenuous contestation over keynote selection is not surprising given the
                     symbolic weight of the keynote as an exemplar of how the digital humanities, and
                     academia more broadly framed, is seen to define “merit” in a value judgment that
                     has real-life implications for the CVs and career progressions of those offered
                     keynote slots and the networks and reputational affordances for those that select
                     them. This extends to the awarding of annual prizes at the Digital Humanities
                     conference as well. These power issues often have a gendered aspect.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e1799">[22]</a> For example, the 2013 conference in
                     Nebraska was sharply rebuked by attendees when almost all the awards and keynote
                     addresses were offered to those identifying publicly as men. It has been noted that
                     although, in binary terms, there is near gender parity across attendees of Digital
                     Humanities conferences, there is a far higher concentration of men presenting
                     standard papers [<a class="ref" href="#eichmannkalwara_etal2018">Eichmann-Kalwara, Jorgensen, and Weingart 2018</a>]. But, given that the
                     conference is made up of parallel sessions, each conference participant can only
                     attend a select number of these and it is impossible to personally experience the
                     power disparity at full scale. Keynote and plenaries are a different matter since
                     there are no competing events and all conference attendees can be in the room for
                     the
                     one session. On the first day of proceedings at the 2015 conference, in which only
                     men were seen on stage (nine of them, one after another), a vigorous backchannel
                     twitter discussion arose in response to what was described as the “parade of the patriarchs” (<a href="#figure01">See Figure

                     [<a class="ref" href="#krippendorff2018">Krippendorff 2018</a>] to look at gender distribution in the keynotes of
                     Digital Humanities conferences. For 31 years of ADHO conferences (1990-2020
                     inclusive) we analyzed the gender of invited keynote speakers (assessed by pronouns
                     used by the speakers themselves in the published record). To the best of our
                     knowledge there were no explicit non-binary keynote speakers, an omission which
                     itself demands reflection and redress. There were 73 keynote speaker slots (counting
                     repeating individuals and “duets” in which two speakers filled a slot): these
                     went to men 51 times, and women 22 times. There were 67 unique speakers (47 men, and
                     20 women). 5 individuals had been asked to deliver a keynote multiple times: Burrows
                     (3), Drucker (2), Queman (2), Aguera (2) and McCarty (2). There were 12 conferences
                     with men-only keynotes: 3 conferences with women-only keynotes, and 7 conferences
                     where there were equal numbers of keynotes. If we were to aim to achieve parity,
                     assuming that there will be only two unique keynote speaker slots at future
                     conferences, we would need to program women-only keynotes for the next 15 years of
                     conferences, until 2035. This deficit persists despite the fact that gender
                     disparities in keynote addresses have improved in more recent times: in the first
                     8
                     years of conferences in our data only men gave keynotes. Since 2012 there has been
                     at
                     least one woman keynote speaker at each of the conferences. In some instances, this
                     opportunity has been created by expanding the number of keynotes presented rather
                     than not including men speakers. In other words, there haven't been fewer men. The
                     last all-men keynote line-up was 2011 which had four men keynote speakers (including
                     a closing keynote presented jointly by two men). But, as noted, the pace of change
                     is
                     not enough to deliver on the promise of parity for some time to come. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p50">The homophily of keynote invitations is further underscored in an analysis of the
                     institutional affiliations of speakers. Of the 73 keynote speaking roles — with some
                     keynote sessions involving two speakers — 72 reported an institutional (almost always
                     academic) affiliation. Over a third (25) worked for European institutions and it
                     should be noted that 50% (36) were located at universities and research institutes
                     in
                     the USA and Canada. The entire, vast and various, rest of the world (ROW) contributed
                     only 11 speakers. Many of these 11 were programmed in the most recent three
                     conferences. To put that a different way: in the first 22 years of the conference
                     (1990-2011) there were only two keynote presentations in which the speaker was
                     affiliated with an institution outside Europe and North America — and both those
                     presentations were given by the same man (John Burrows from the University of
                     Newcastle in Australia). Four years later, in 2015, the conference was finally
                     located, for the first time, outside either Europe or USA/Canada in Sydney
                     (Australia). By this time (including the 2015 Sydney conference) the accumulated ROW
                     keynotes numbered seven, three of which had been delivered by the one man, again —
                     John Burrows. Men are uniformly overrepresented as a proportion of speakers in this
                     geo-locational analysis — the same percentage (72%) of the speaking roles in the Europe/UK
                     and USA/Canada cohorts respectively were filled by men. As a proportion of the ROW
                     women make up 36% of the total speaker slots which expands to 44% if we adjust for
                     “Burrowing,” i.e. the effect of repeated keynote appearances by John Burrows. Based on an analysis
                     of the aggregate numbers alone, if you want to secure selection as a keynote presenter
                     at an ADHO conference, it would help to be a white man, ideally based at a North American
                     institution and preferably named John (or a variation thereof).</div>

                     and celebrated: to be put “center stage” (both literally and figuratively). Some
                     conference organizers but to our mind, not nearly enough have worked consciously to
                     ensure that people from historically under-represented groups occupied prominent
                     positions at the conference, including the delivery of keynotes. Most often, and
                     despite the best efforts of these individual conference chairs, the program has not
                     delivered on rudimentary equity and diversity baselines, notably in terms of keynote
                     speakers. We must ask the community: why? </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p52">52</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p52">In part, the selection of keynotes often relies on issues of academic prestige and
                     rank. Senior scholars who are overwhelmingly male and white within digital humanities
                     contexts have, as we’ve demonstrated, been rewarded with keynote opportunities. There
                     is a general reluctance for keynotes to be assigned to those who aren’t well-known
                     within national or global digital humanities. This then reproduces their notoriety.
                     Problematizing the selection of keynotes is the requirement that local organizers
                     have input on keynote selection. This can manifest in conflicts over whether a
                     potential speaker will be appealing enough to encourage people to register for the
                     conference. It can also manifest in local organizers strongly desiring a given
                     speaker to recognize someone from their own national contexts. Neither program
                     committees nor local organizers are without blame in this dynamic; the conflict
                     between them is baked in through the conference protocols where the local organizers
                     budget for the keynote which leads them to further want input into the selection.
                     While the keynote is technically part of the academic program, the
                     “sale-ability” of the person is of utmost concern as there is a perception
                     that the keynote might attract participants who otherwise might not attend. </div>

                     and accountability, justice for underrepresented communities will not be delivered
                     by
                     the ADHO conference. It is not without some small measure of irony that a Digital
                     Humanities conference system is unable to apply even a small number of data-driven
                     approaches to implementing open decision making and transparent answerability to the
                     digital humanities community. In addition to the regional and linguistic profile of
                     speakers, we support an intentional effort to bring to the forefront practices that
                     are not necessarily in the current core of the field. To our minds, some of the most
                     memorable keynote speeches have shared an interest in presenting <em class="emph">other</em>
                     ways of seeing, understanding, and computing the world. They have also had in common
                     an emphasis on how digital technologies can be used for ethnic, cultural,
                     epistemological, and sometimes physical survival. We therefore suggest that it should
                     be a prerequisite in conference organization protocols to pledge to have a
                     multiplicity of genders across keynote invitations, with weighting towards non-male
                     members of academic staff, to give them access to the prestige mechanisms which exist
                     within our scholarly societies, that will go on to impact their careers. </div>

                     has rested with the conference organizing and program committees, which change
                     personnel and priorities on a yearly basis. Moreover, MLMC has ex officio
                     representation on these committees but has no budget and no direct responsibility
                     or
                     authority for the actions of the committee — or of ADHO in general. Indeed, the
                     responsibilities of the MLMC for the conference have been narrowly focused on
                     coordinating the translation of the CfP from English to ADHO’s other four official
                     languages: French, Spanish, German, and Italian. Translations into other languages
                     –
                     Polish in Krakow 2016 [<a class="ref" href="#dh2016">DH2016 n.d.</a>], Portuguese in 2018 [<a class="ref" href="#dh2018">DH2018 n.d.</a>], and Anishinàbemiwin/Algonquin in Ottawa 2020 [<a class="ref" href="#dh2020a">DH2020 n.d. “CfP: Anishinabeg”</a>] – have often fallen onto program committee chairs or local
                     organizers to do themselves or to obtain funding to pay for translation services.
                     The
                     contradictory aspiration of diversity through multilingualism, the lack of influence
                     from MLMC, and the annually diverging approaches of conference organizers have
                     resulted not just on radically uneven results from one year to another but, worse,
                     on
                     disappointing measures. </div>

                     when the Call for Papers was published in twenty-three languages, multilingual
                     participation was extremely low. As Martin Grandjean wrote in his report on the
                     result of that appeal, submissions to the conference were in only six languages other
                     than English, resulting in just 4.1% of all presentations being delivered in French,
                     Spanish, Italian, or German [<a class="ref" href="#grandjean2014">Grandjean 2014</a>]. In this scenario, the
                     aspirations for a multilingual conference failed to materialize, and also added
                     additional overhead to the peer review process, including identifying and gathering
                     enough reviews in minority languages. While those less knowledgeable might assume
                     that the lack of participation was a result of an absence of digital humanities
                     activities, or worse a deficiency in quality, in areas working in those languages,
                     the reality is that the lack of submissions has likely been a result of systemic
                     obstacles to multi-lingual participation. This includes the patent inadequacy of
                     multilingual affordances in the conference management tool, the lack of resources
                     allocated to translation efforts, the scarcity of identified peer reviewers willing
                     or able to evaluate non-English abstracts, and a lack of outreach to multilingual
                     communities who engage in digital humanities practices but do not strictly define
                     themselves as digital humanists. </div>

                     English from conference delegates. Accounts of conference rooms being partially
                     vacated when presentations were offered in Spanish, French, German, or Italian have
                     not been rare. This has occurred despite the origination and support for the DH
                     Whispers campaign, implemented in 2014 by Alex Gil and Élika Ortega. Attendees who
                     were willing to help out translating to or from any language being used at the

                     English speakers have felt coerced into submitting proposals and delivering papers
                     in
                     English in order to receive the attention of their colleagues. This complex set of
                     organizational and cultural attitudes towards multilingual conferencing poses
                     challenges that despite concerted efforts have not always panned out. A review of
                     conference acceptance data across years shows that while in 2018 (Mexico City), about
                     18% of the accepted papers and posters were in a language other than English, this
                     was nearly double the next-highest levels of conference multilinguality: there were
                     about 9% non-English proposal accepted to the two preceding conferences (Krákow in
                     2016 and Montréal in 2017), but prior to 2016, the percentage of non-English papers
                     was most often 0% or 1%, with a local high of just 4% in Lausanne in 2014. We have
                     to
                     look all the way back to the 2006 conference in Paris (which predates both ADHO and
                     its official “DH” conference designation) to find similar linguistic diversity:
                     it included about 10% non-English papers. And although the 2016-2018 percentages on
                     multilingualism may appear to represent a strongly positive current trend, in fact
                     these statistics have since returned to just above their previous extreme low: the
                     2019 (Utrecht) conference included about 2% non-English presentations, and 2020
                     conference (to have been in Ottawa, but canceled due to COVID-19) included about 3%
                     non-English acceptances despite a strong local French-speaking digital humanities
                     community. </div>

                     examine the shifts in the implementation of the stated importance of linguistic
                     diversity. DH2017 and DH2018, celebrated in Montreal and Mexico City respectively,
                     were both officially bilingual. This included bilingual keynote presentations as well
                     as panels that shared a topic or methodology but included papers in both languages.
                     This was likely facilitated by having members in the program committees and/or the
                     local organizers who were fluent in both languages and belonged to scholarly
                     communities working across English-French and English-Spanish. We believe this may
                     have encouraged submissions by reaching out to immediate networks. Conversely, the
                     CfP for DH2019 in Utrecht explicitly stated that “The primary language of the conference will be English, but we
                     warmly invite proposals written in other languages for which we have a sufficient
                     pool of peer reviewers (German, Italian, French and Spanish)”

                     expectedly, DH2019 saw very low submissions in languages other than English. This
                     was
                     particularly pronounced as the accepted program was the largest to date in the
                     history of the Digital Humanities conference. In contrast, DH2020 in Ottawa
                     explicitly solicited submissions in all five required ADHO languages and centered
                     multiculturalism rather than linguistic diversity, bringing to the forefront native,
                     indigenous and decolonial studies, while also acknowledging Ottawa’s official
                     bilingualism. Yet, there were no submissions in Anishinàbemiwin/Algonquin and few
                     in
                     French. As a result, “the primary language” defaulted to English despite efforts
                     to welcome non-English submissions. </div>

                     concern within ADHO, the actual practice of multilingualism has varied widely and,
                     unfortunately, has not yielded the diversity results it has been expected to — not
                     in
                     terms of linguistic diversity and certainly not in equity at large. It is undeniable
                     that English continues to be a powerful and useful lingua franca in the field (which
                     has been noted in other disciplines, however it has also been noted that this creates
                     an excluding barrier in academic discourse in the conference setting (Fregonese
                     2017). However, it is also one that encodes modalities of writing and epistemologies
                     of the academies that use it and implied notions of merit. Thus, among the most
                     important obstacles is the human infrastructure required to evaluate proposals
                     appropriately as we have argued in the section devoted to peer review. Likewise
                     lacking is a conference infrastructure capable of accommodating multilingualism at
                     every step of the conference process: from the conference management, to the
                     publication of the CfP, to the reviewing of proposals, to the proceedings of live
                     presentations, and then to the publication of conference papers. </div>

                     that the prism of multilingualism that has been favored in ADHO, on its own, is not
                     capacious enough to lead to more diversity, a just way of evaluating proposals, or
                     a
                     wider understanding of various academic cultures. Moreover, multilingualism is also
                     too narrow to foster anti-hegemonic, anti-racist, anticolonial, gender-balanced
                     conference practices and operations. Indeed, even in the instances where linguistic
                     diversity was central to the conference, it alone has done little to address these
                     parallel problems. Aside from instances where specific PC chairs have taken action,
                     it has fallen upon groups outside of ADHO governance and of the various committees
                     in
                     charge of organizing the conference to bring these issues to the forefront. In recent

                     advocated not just for incorporating multilingualism beyond the CfP itself and in
                     presentations and other aspects of the conference but also underscored how equity

                     enough for diversity and equity aspirations nor has it been evenly applied at past
                     conferences. Similarly, we encourage Local Organizers to budget funds for equity and
                     diversity measures from the beginning. Elements which should be considered in the
                     budget include live and printed translation costs, accessibility measures (<a href="#conclusion">see below</a>), and funding to support participants from

                     set clear timelines for goals, assessments, and consequences. ConfTool could be used
                     to gather data related to biographical and demographic details. A standardized
                     post-conference survey, which has not been utilized in previous years, could also
                     be
                     useful to gather information about what initiatives were effective or not in a given
                     year. Further, initiatives demonstrated to be successful must have continuity,
                     permanent financial support, and not be abandoned by future PC Chairs when they
                     diverge from opinions held by chairs or their constituent organizations. </div>

                        other underrepresented individuals. ADHO must conduct a study of labor associated
                        with the conference to both quantify the amount of time devoted to the conference
                        throughout the multiyear cycle but also address how volunteer labor might be
                        compensated in the future. That report should be made publicly available and must
                        establish accountability benchmarks to address inequity. This would likely include
                        a basic conference staff that doesn’t change every year to ensure some level of
                        continuity and to serve as an institutional memory of why things are the way they

                        additionally, it would be more effective than having to ask past PC chairs, a

                        their unpaid service to the organization. Additionally, should the conference

                        change? We all agreed to be program committee chairs because we felt we were part
                        of a community and could contribute to the conference organization process.
                        Helping shape a year’s discussion is, indeed, a privilege. Yet, as this article
                        has outlined, there are bureaucratic procedures that can hamstring program
                        committee chairs and that can exact a mental and emotional toll. </div>

                        conference organization served to hinder rather than advance our commitment to
                        ADHO and curtailed our professional accomplishments in the field. For most of us,
                        the experience serving as program chairs led to a range of alienating experiences,
                        the severity of which varied for each person: implicit and explicit harassment
                        included bullying; social media and email harassment and threats; anxiety and
                        depression; and professional burnout lasting years beyond the conference years as
                        a result of the levels of work
                        expected. These experiences are
                        not one-offs; they are symptoms of systemic and ongoing problems. These costs to
                        us are in addition to the impact of this work on our curriculum vitae, where the
                        years serving as conference chairs are reflected gaps within our professional
                        trajectory. We request that our experiences and concerns be recognized as
                        systemically induced and addressed as such, particularly given that some
                        perpetrators of these actions include people, mostly men, who remained in
                        leadership roles in ADHO and the constituent organizations and flourish within the
                        field. These frequently gendered encounters have not been recognized within
                        conference processes and are instead often framed as personal failures of women
                        chairs rather than issues of governance and accountability. </div>
