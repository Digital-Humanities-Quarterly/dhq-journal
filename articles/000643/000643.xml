				<!--Include a brief abstract of the article-->
				<p>Academic conferences are considered central to the dissemination of research
					and play a key role in the prestige systems of academia. And yet the
					organization of these, and the power systems they maintain, have been
					little discussed. What is a conference supposed to achieve? Who and what is
					it for? The annual Alliance of Digital Humanities Organization (ADHO)’s
					Digital Humanities conference is a central occasion in the digital
					humanities academic calendar, and, as an international, interdisciplinary,
					regular, long-standing, large-scale event, it provides an ideal locus to
					consider various aspects of contemporary academic conference organization,
					and how this impacts the shape and definition of a scholarly field.
					Examining this annual event allows us to clarify ADHO’s policies and
					procedures to consider how they frame the digital humanities at large. This
					paper approaches the annual Digital Humanities conference via a
					Reflection-in-Action and Reflection-on-Action approach encompassing the
					experiences of various people formally involved in organizing the
					conference over the past decade. Considering the last seven years of the
					conference as well as its broader history, we argue that conferences are
					central mechanisms for agenda setting and fostering a community of digital
					humanities practitioners. Through analyses of the selection of Program
					Committees, the choosing of conference themes, the preparation of calls for
					papers, the peer review process, and the selection of keynotes, we contend
					that existing structures and processes inadequately address concerns around
					representation, diversity, multilingualism, and labor. Our recommendations,
					including aligning the conference budget with its priorities, fostering
					fair labor practices, and creating accountability structures will be useful
					to those organizing future Digital Humanities events, and conference
					organizers throughout academia interested in making academic conferences
					more inclusive, welcoming environments that encourage a plurality of voices
					to fully partake in academic discourse. </p>

				<p>The annual <ref target="https://adho.org/">Alliance of Digital Humanities
						Organizations (ADHO)</ref> conference is, for many digital humanities
					scholars, the one event in the academic calendar at which their research
					can be appreciated in all its interdisciplinary glory.<note>This article
						capitalizes Digital Humanities when it refers to the Alliance of
						Digital Humanities Organizations and the Digital Humanities
						conference; we use lowercase to denote the field of digital humanities
						more generally.</note> The slow and uneven uptake of digital research
					methods in many traditional humanities disciplines makes the conference a
					place of refuge for some; an opportunity to <q>nerd out</q> with
					like-minded colleagues despite otherwise evident differences in academic
					backgrounds. The Digital Humanities (DH) conference in this sense has
					adopted something of a <q>Big Tent</q> ethos (indeed, this was the official
					conference theme of DH2011); it is a meeting site where a wide spectrum of
					scholarship can be articulated and heard. </p>
				<p>The metaphor of the <q>Big Tent</q> has been debated as a defining feature of
					the digital humanities itself. In one of the earliest of the <q>Big
						Tent</q> reflections, William Pannapacker momentarily switches
					metaphors to ponder, <cit><quote source="#pannapacker2011b" rend="inline"
							>The digital humanities may seem like a lifeboat amid the
							wreckage of higher education in the humanities, but it’s not
							large enough to hold everyone who’s still in the water</quote>
						<ptr target="#pannapacker2011b"/></cit>. For Pannapaker, the question
					of inclusion at the DH conference is one of <q>scale</q> (however
					impossible that may seem to resolve). But as Ethan Watrall has noted, the
					issue is also one of <q>curation</q> or gatekeeping: <cit><quote
							source="#watrall2016" rend="inline">Whatever the perspective on
							the <q>Big Tent,</q> the metaphor has inevitably led to debate as
							to who is in this <q>tent</q> and who is not</quote>
						<ptr target="#watrall2016"/></cit>. Watrall focuses his attention on
					the absence of relevant disciplines, in particular archaeology, at the
					annual event. Others have taken digital humanities data techniques and
					applied them to the conference itself to assess just how encompassing the
					Big Tent really is.<note>Bryan Alexander and Rebecca Frost Davis (2012)
						point to conferences, particularly the ADHO conference, as a site of
						knowledge production that can exclude (or not reflect) digital
						humanities research and pedagogy at liberal arts schools and smaller
						institutions. Alexander and Frost Davis note that in 2009 (Maryland),
						only <quote rend="inline">five presenters and two posters from a total
							of three hundred and sixty participants were scholars at [North
							American] small liberal arts colleges</quote>
						<ptr target="#alexander_etal2012" loc="372–373"/>; in 2010 (London),
							<quote rend="inline">of the one hundred and forty institutions of
							various types listed on the program, only two were North American
							small liberal arts colleges</quote>
						<ptr target="#alexander_etal2012" loc="372"/>.</note>
				</p>
				<p>In their article <title rend="quotes">What’s Under the Big Tent?</title>
					Scott Weingart and Nickoal Eichmann find that, although the conference has
					consistently grown, this expansion has not necessarily equated to a
					commensurate increase in the diversity of topics, disciplines, or
					participants <ptr target="#weingart_etal2017"/>:</p>
				<quote source="#weingart_etal2017" rend="block">The data show that over the last
					decade, ADHO’s international conference has become slightly more
					collaborative and regionally diverse, that text and literature currently
					reign supreme, and that women are underrepresented with no signs of
					improvement thus far. </quote>
				<p>As Élika Ortega noted in <title rend="quotes">Zonas de Contacto: A Digital
						Humanities Ecology of Knowledges,</title> there is a <quote
						rend="inline" source="#ortega2019">latent tension between the digital
						humanities that takes place in the <q>centers of gravity,</q> such as
						the Digital Humanities annual conference…and the digital humanities
						that is happening outside of such centers</quote>
					<ptr target="#ortega2019"/>. </p>
				<p>As the largest and most recognized global conference in the field of digital
					humanities, it is critical to reflect on what it is the conference is
					supposed to <emph>do</emph>, and who and what it is <emph>for</emph>? As
					more digital humanities conferences emerge with various national, regional,
					linguistic, thematic, disciplinary, methodological, and other foci, we
					believe that our international organization should rethink the point of the
					conference through the perspective of diversity, equity, inclusion and
					decolonization. Similarly, the conference’s stated purpose for <quote
						source="#adhoc" rend="inline">the benefit of its members and for the
						advancement of research and scholarship in the variety of disciplines
						and professions they represent</quote>
					<ptr target="#adhoc"/> is overdue for a reconsideration that centers
					justice rather than merit, equity rather than innovation, polyvocality
					rather than canons, differences rather than standards, and inclusion rather
					than gatekeeping. This article provides guidelines as a basis for future
					conference organizers to shape upcoming conferences.</p>
				<p>Such a reconceptualization of the conference has the potential to strengthen
					the diversity of the field from its very foundation, not just as a factor
					of language or nationality.<note>For more on the value of diversifying
						academic disciplines including its conference, as well as potential
						steps forward, see work undertaken in the discipline of communication
						studies including <ptr target="#gardner2018"/> and <ptr
							target="#mayer_etal2018"/>.</note> Further, an approach to
					conference organizing based on these principles would also clarify what
					position the ADHO conference occupies in the growing (and sometimes
					conflicting) ecology of digital humanities conferences. To allow <title
						rend="quotes">Digital Cultural Empowerment</title> (DH2014), to
					encourage <title rend="quotes">Global Digital Humanities</title> (DH2015),
					to address <title rend="quotes">Digital Identities: the Past and the
						Future</title> (DH2016), to provide <title rend="quotes"
						>Access/Accès</title> (DH2017), to build <title rend="quotes"
						>Bridges/Puentes</title> (DH2018), to consider <title rend="quotes"
						>Complexities</title> (DH2019), to meet at <title rend="quotes"
						>Carrefours/Intersections</title> (DH2020): these official themes of
					DH conferences past all speak in support of the principles that we advocate
					here, but that we argue have been implemented inconsistently and with
					varying degrees of success. The realities of the conference processes do
					not always align with the themes.</p>
				<p>The DH conference represents the good intentions of many actors (ADHO
					organizations, program committee, local organizers, and so forth) to
					welcome people to the conference and expand the digital humanities
					community. And yet, despite these best motivations, the conference suffers
					high levels of inaccessibility, language restrictions, poor distribution of
					knowledge and lost research. The cost of the conference is high, as is true
					of almost all such academic events - not just fiscally but also
					environmentally (all those air fuel miles...) and personally for those who
					give up valuable years of an academic life to deliver an event of limited
					or uncertain personal and community benefit. Indeed it might be argued that
					the real, underlying work that the conference does is to create curriculum
					vitae lines that recognize service rather than meet the intellectual needs
					of the field. </p>
				<p>In the shadows, behind the conference tent is an opaque, hierarchically
					regulated, global bureaucracy which distributes decision-making in ways
					that make meaningful interventions for change difficult to imagine. Which
					bodies answer to whom? Who can assert their authority and in which
					contexts? When something goes wrong, who takes responsibility for answering
					the emails, and who addresses the issue publicly? When something goes
					right, who gets the credit? </p>
				<p>We write and reflect on these questions as a group of digital humanities
					practitioner-scholars who have experienced the vagaries of the annual ADHO
					conference organization first hand. In this article, we use our front-row
					insights to explore the ways in which the conference is articulated,
					organized, and facilitated through conference protocols and processes. The
					conference protocols, which are bureaucratic documents established to guide
					the conference process, outline workflows and encode the principles of the
					organization. The essay generally follows the temporal flow of the
					conference organization process, but a number of crucial value-based themes
					(probably the most central themes of this essay) are woven throughout:
					multilingualism; equity, representation, and diversity; visibility and
					labor issues; and others. We start with a brief presentation of these
					themes, then point back to them throughout the essay as they arise in the
					course of conference organization. </p>
				<p>While some aspects of the international DH conference exist because they have
					been thoughtfully decided by multiple committees, other elements are
					retained because of past practice. There is an assumption written into the
					conference processes that conference committee members, authors, and
					participants are familiar with the protocols and will be held to them
					equally. The reality is that few are familiar with the protocols at the
					level needed to have a seamless conference process. A lack of transparency
					in how ADHO and its conference works is also deeply felt by many digital
					humanities community members. Although efforts have been made to remediate
					a general lack of understanding of just how ADHO functions, this continues
					to be an issue. This essay challenges us to reflect not only on past
					practice but also on what should be carried forward — and what changes
					could be made to better reflect the values discussed here. Throughout the
					essay, we detail how issues such as equity around gender and
					representation, and multilingualism play out within the ADHO Digital
					Humanities conference space. We recognize that these two threads are not
					inclusive of all forms of equity and representation including race,
					ability, sexuality, ethnicity, class and all the intersectional dimensions
					of these that are articulated in the conference process. However,
					multilingualism and gender have received extensive attention from ADHO
					officers, conference organizers, and attendees. As such, we launch our
					analysis by positing that equity, particularly gender equity and
					multilingual representation, are not questions of proportional
					representation where the conference should reflect gender <q>balance</q> or
						<q>proportional</q> participation from the various multilingual
					constituencies. Rather, conference organizers should discuss what
					constitutes gender equity and make the results of that conversation public.
					Equity should, of course, be based on reparative action and restorative
					approaches to conference organization. These actions and approaches would
					require identification of all who have been harmed in previous conference
					work, conference attendance, and the spheres of influence created through
					conference processes. </p>
				<p>ADHO, as with many other scholarly organizations, is driven by unpaid
					volunteers who work diligently to create a scholarly community and an
					international conference that reflect the current trends and advances in
					scholarship. This article recognizes this scholarly labor while also
					pointing to the structural challenges that these volunteers face. It
					suggests that conference organizing is not merely an act of service but is
					a scholarly activity that should be treated as such. From this perspective,
					then, we are obligated to study and critique the conference as a site of
					cultural production. The issues we discuss here are grounded in the digital
					humanities but speak to broader academic practice within academic
					conferences. Acknowledging these complicated challenges is the first step
					to rectifying them in order to create an equitable and welcoming
					environment for conference organizers and attendees alike.</p>

				<head>Methodology: Digital Humanities in the Hall of Mirrors</head>
				<p>Despite their centrality to academic communication, circulation of research,
					and their use as a measure of prestige within tenure and promotion
					dossiers, academic conferences are an understudied sociological phenomenon.
					Some publications about conferences are conference reports that reflect on
					the events and programs of a given conference; other publications consider
					the practical elements such as <quote source="#pedaste_etal2021"
						rend="inline">value, management, timing, program, people, protection,
						scaffolds, and money</quote>
					<ptr target="#pedaste_etal2021" loc="92"/>.<note>For more articles that
						offer practical advice on conference organizing, but with a focus on
						sciences, see, for instance, <ptr target="#reshef_etal2020"/> and <ptr
							target="#sarabipour_etal2021"/>.</note> The little research on
					conferences as sites of academic knowledge production centers on four key
					functions: <quote source="#gross_etal2011" rend="inline">intellectual
						communication, professional socialization, the reproduction of
						academic status hierarchies, and the legitimation of new subfields or
						paradigms</quote>
					<ptr target="#gross_etal2011" loc="153"/>. The sociologists Cole and Cole
					pay attention to the fact that intellectual communications allocate more
					status and prestige to some members of the academic community than to
					others <ptr target="#cole_etal1974"/>. Miné de Klerk points to academic
					conferences as sites of networking that lead to <quote
						source="#deklerk2021" rend="inline">academic career advance, to spark
						research collaborations, or even lead to future employment</quote>
					<ptr target="#deklerk2021" loc="116"/>. Our article draws on conference
					organizing experience to consider how practical and organizational
					structures impact accessibility and diversity. Joining these two
					perspectives allows us to understand how knowledge production and
					intellectual community are rendered through conference organization.</p>
				<p>A more recent paper by Ayesha I.T. Tulloch <ptr target="#tulloch2020"/>
					evaluating the actions and policies of conferences held by international
					academic societies for ecology and conservation found that while <quote
						source="#tulloch2020" rend="inline">Conferences are important for
						professional learning and for building academics’ reputations and
						networks</quote> the quantity and quality of initiatives to promote

				<p>The ADHO annual conference is an ideal conference to study as an example of
					academic conferences. It is interdisciplinary and international in nature.
					It is a large-scale conference that has grown rapidly throughout the past
					decade. It has doubled in size, now regularly attracting more than 1000
					attendees. Additionally, much of the materiality of the conference
					including portions of its documentation from previous conferences are
					available online. This paper details the results of Reflection-in-Action,
					Reflection-on-Action, and Action Research discussions from individuals who
					have all held organizational roles within the Digital Humanities annual
					conference. Writing as program chairs, some of this article’s authors have
					also served in multiple roles including Local Organizers and Alliance of
					Digital Humanities Organizations Conference Coordinating Committee members. </p>
				<p>Reflection-in-Action, and its counterpart, Reflection-on-Action, provides a
					methodological framework commonly used in Information Science and Human
					Computer Interaction to identify <quote source="#schon1983" rend="inline"
						>features of the practice situation – complexity, uncertainty,
						instability, uniqueness and value conflict</quote>
					<ptr target="#schon1983" loc="18"/>. Given the experience of the authors, a
					structured set of reflections upon the experience of working on the ADHO
					conference, and access to their contemporary notes, emails, and reports
					written during the conference process, were essential to the success of our
					task. A complementary Reflection-on-Action process, comparing and
					contrasting time spent volunteering when organizing past conferences, noted
					best (or improper) practice, and elicited the practical and theoretical
					knowledge gained. This helped the authors process and note both their
					experiences and actions, and understand and revisit underlying power
					structures and protocols. An Action Research recursive methodology <ptr
						target="#stringer2013"/>, overlapping with collaborative
					self-ethnography approaches <ptr target="#clapp2017"/>, allowed us to
					synthesize previous records of the decision making mechanisms for
					conference organization and the discussions that surround them (including
					decisions implemented via conference management software, emails, and
					minutes, many of which resided in author’s own personal archives). In
					practical terms, this was achieved through regular online meetings and
					discussions on structured topics over a six month period, with high levels
					of note-taking using shared online tools, interspersed with recursive
					co-creation, writing, and editing, using timed sprints and agreed
					deadlines, often setting aside periods of time to recover or locate
					dispersed information related to the conference that had never before been
					brought together, or that had not been institutionally archived. Other
					members of the community were contacted for records and to check details,
					where needed (although many chose to remain anonymous). A coordinated
					writing sprint brought together these various strands. Together, these
					collaborative, digitally mediated (and enabled) approaches elicited the
					history, analysis, and interpretation of the organization of the Digital
					Humanities annual conference, allowing full documentation, and presenting
					key findings which will be of use both to others in digital humanities, but
					also to others considering academic conference organization in other
					domains. </p>

				<head>Background: The History and Organizational Framework of the ADHO
					Conference</head>
				<p>The international Digital Humanities conference convenes a community of
					digital humanities practitioners and scholars annually. The initial DH
					conference was held in 1989 at the University of Toronto and brought
					together two existing events, the 16th annual meeting of the Association
					for Literary and Linguistic Computing (ALLC, now the European Association
					for Digital Humanities, <ref target="https://eadh.org/">EADH</ref>) and the
					ninth annual meeting of International Conference on Computers and the
					Humanities (ICCH), which was sponsored with and by the <ref
						target="https://ach.org/">Association for Computers and the Humanities
						(ACH)</ref>
					<ptr target="#adhoc"/>. Subsequent conferences included participants from
					additional organizations that became part of the Alliance as it exists
					today. This international collaboration was what led, in part, to the
					creation of the Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations (ADHO) in 2005
						<ptr target="#unsworth2007"/>, <quote source="#adhoa" rend="inline">an
						umbrella organization whose goals are to promote and support digital
						research and teaching across arts and humanities disciplines, drawing
						together humanists engaged in digital and computer-assisted research,
						teaching, creation, dissemination, and beyond, in all areas reflected
						by its diverse membership</quote>
					<ptr target="#adhoa"/>. In 2007, the international conference took the name
					Digital Humanities [year], often abbreviated to DH[year] and seen on social
					media as #DHyyyy. </p>
				<p>The annual DH conference is the result of extensive labor from a changing
					group of people each year, who are involved in a complex committee
					structure that is governed by a conference organizing protocol. As Márton
					Demeter points out, <quote source="#demeter2020" rend="inline">conference
						organizers and committees</quote> are <quote source="#demeter2020"
						rend="inline">collective agents,</quote>
					<quote source="#demeter2020" rend="inline">in the sense that they have an
						impact, or at least are capable of having a significant impact on
						other agents</quote>
					<ptr target="#demeter2020" loc="43–44"/>. The committee structure and
					workflows have evolved over years, in an attempt to define — from the top
					down — the discipline and its labor through a <q>global</q> conference. In
					2020, ADHO published a new and revised conference protocol on their site
					that outlines some of the workflow towards the conference <ptr
						target="#adhocp"/>. The conference organization is as follows: a group
					of people write a proposal to host the conference; these bids are vetted by
					ADHO’s Conference Coordinating Committee (CCC).<note>As recently as the
						call to host the 2022 conference, ADHO referred to <quote
							source="#adhocfh" rend="inline">the three-year regional rotation
							schedule adopted by the ADHO steering committee in 2014,</quote>
						which cycles through North America, Europe, and the rest of the world
							<ptr target="#adhocfh"/>. Eve Ng and Paula Gardner, writing about
						the International Communication Association (ICA) conference, note the
						importance of de-centering Western conference locations and
						emphasizing accessible conference locations in order to foster
						participation from diverse scholars <ptr target="#ng_etal2020"/>. See
						also <ptr target="#gardner2018"/> on the value of regional conferences
						for an international community of scholars.</note> If selected, the
					people who proposed to host become the Local Organizers (LO). When the
					location is selected, a constituent organization of ADHO is assigned as
					host. That organization’s leadership proposes two Program Committee (PC)
					chairs who have to be approved by the Conference Coordinating Committee and
					ADHO governing boards; until 2017 there was a single PC chair per
					conference. At least one of these individuals must have served previously
					on a Digital Humanities conference program committee in order to be
					confirmed as chair. </p>
				<p>The division of labor for the conference is complicated and ADHO offers
					copious policy documents that attempt to describe the key requirements. The
					Local Organizers are in charge of the budget (including sponsorship),
					receptions, venues, excursions, website, and other details such as ensuring
					accessibility, keynote translation, etc. The Program Committee handles the
					creation of the call for papers, selection of keynotes (with approval by
					the Local Organizers),<note>The selection of keynotes was unequally applied
						between 2014 and 2020. In 2020, the Conference protocols were
						officially revised to specifically note that the selection of the
						keynote is the responsibility of the Program Committee (versus chairs
						of the Committee or Local Organizers, either of which had undertaken
						that task in some years).</note> peer reviewing the academic program,
					scheduling the academic program, and publishing the selected proceedings.
					While this list of tasks might seem a simple division of labor, in
					practice, there are many gray areas, such as coordinating the publication
					of the book of abstracts which is separate from a proceedings volume of
					full essays. Many conference elements — for instance, coordinating special
					interest group (SIG) workshops require the Local Organizers to work closely
					with the program committee chairs. Cooperation, communication, and goodwill
					between the Local Organizers (LO) and Program Committee (PC) chairs is
					essential and each conference entails subtle variations in how tasks are
					negotiated and allocated between them. </p>
				<p>Further, the conference is facilitated by the <q>backstage</q> volunteer
					labor of hundreds of digital humanists who lend both their digital
					humanities expertise and their linguistic and scholarly capacities as
					reviewers and attendees. Little attention is given to the volunteerism that
					is required to organize, facilitate, and ultimately complete a full
					conference cycle. Committee members, chairs, reviewers, moderators, on-site
					staffing, etc. are each essential to realizing the conference. Yet, there
					is little to no attention paid to how this unpaid labor structure is
					enacted, inscribes inequities, alters career trajectories, and impacts
					personal lives. </p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<head>Step Right Up: Representation on the Program Committee</head>
				<p>The program committee for the annual Digital Humanities conference is
					composed of representatives from each of the constituent organizations,
					with the goal of each organization having equal representation in the
					development of the academic program.<note>For a list of ADHO’s constituent
						organizations: <ptr target="#adhoa"/>. </note> Each association brings
					its own organizational interests, as does each representative. Yet, the
					lack of standardization of organizations within ADHO creates two
					intertwined problems: 1) the conflation of diverse perspectives within
					individual associations because of the limitations on representation and 2)
					the lack of perspectives beyond those held by those already reflected
					within a constituent organization.<note>For more on the geographical and
						disciplinary differences in expectations when it comes to conferences
						(such as length of abstracts and prestige of
						presentations/publications), see Estill and Guiliano forthcoming in
							<title rend="italic">Digital Studies/Le Champ Numerique</title>
						<ptr target="#estill_etal"/>.</note> Tension exists between
					individually-held perspectives and positions and those of one’s constituent
					organization. Is a representative's responsibility to contribute their own
					perspectives or is it to reflect those of one’s organization? Additionally,
					what exactly is one’s duty on the program committee? Is it to read and
					review submissions? Set policies related to the academic program? Establish
					the conference schedule? These and many other questions arise with the
					installation of the program committee and its members.</p>
				<p>We offer a few brief examples of how these problems play out when the current
					PC structure mirrors ADHO’s constituent organization structure. On the one
					hand, one of ADHO’s constituent organizations, the European Association of
					Digital Humanities (EADH) spans an entire multilingual and multicultural
					continent yet only has one or two representatives. This flattens the
					differences and competing interests among the scholars inside the
					association that might present unique perspectives. EADH itself is
					comprised of associate and partner organizations, including national
					societies such as the <ref target="http://www.aiucd.it/">Associazione
						Informatica Umanistica e Cultura Digita</ref> (AIUCD); one partner
					organization, <ref target="http://dhnb.eu/">Digital Humanities in the
						Nordic and Baltic Countries </ref> (DHNB), itself represents DH
					practitioners from multiple nations. EADH thus has many voices often
					represented as one. On the other hand, ADHO has multiple nationally-based
					societies as the <ref target="https://csdh-schn.org/">Canadian Society for
						Digital Humanities/Société canadienne des humanités numériques</ref>
					(CSDH/SCHN) and the <ref target="http://tadh.org.tw/en/">Taiwanese
						Association for Digital Humanities</ref> (TADH), which are smaller
					organizations with fewer members. While equal representation ensures a
					balance of power in decision-making, it does not allow for nuanced
					representation of the differing communities and interests that might
					diverge from the majority position within an organization. The lack of
					nuance, particularly of representation of those who are not represented by
					a constituent organization, undercuts the values articulated by ADHO.</p>
				<p>Two organizations represented on the program committee are not formally based
					on national or continental borders: <ref target="https://dhcenternet.org/"
						>CenterNet</ref> (which represents digital humanities centers) and
						<ref target="http://www.humanisti.ca/">Humanistica</ref> (which unites
					francophone digital humanists from around the world). Ultimately, however,
					both CenterNet and Humanistica are almost always represented by
					well-established scholars from North America or Europe. In part, this is
					because the barrier to participation in CenterNet is not just having a
					center but it is also having the local financial resources to support
					CenterNet membership. For newly-established centers or those whose
					existence are locally precarious, the likelihood that a non-Western
					early-career-scholar based at a digital humanities center can both be a
					member of CenterNet and would be selected for this service is quite low.
					Humanistica offers a similar challenge in that much of the association’s
					membership is concentrated in North America and Europe rather than
					French-speaking regions outside North America and Europe. As a result,
					representation from non-geographically-based organizations amplifies
					representation of interests in those geographical regions.</p>
				<p>We note, furthermore, that the program committee is heavily weighted towards
					faculty representation from established academic institutions and with
					already recognized professional trajectories. Part of this may lie in the
					issues of workload and labor where those in precarious positions or without
					seniority may not be able to fully participate because of the unfunded
					nature of the work. This is, after all, how the academy works generally.
					But within digital humanities, it may also be a result of being able to
					situate yourself within the organization previously. Those without records
					of participation or active long-term investment in digital humanities
					leadership may struggle to gather the needed support to be appointed to the
					position. This tendency has implications for the program committee’s ethnic
					representation as well, given the dire statistics on race, gender, and the
					academy. For example, it wasn’t until 2018 that a woman of color occupied
					the co-chair position in the program committee for the first time.
					Importantly, though, the appointment deviated from ADHO procedures. DH2018
					was the <quote rend="inline">first to be organised ‘outside’ ADHO,</quote>
					noted Karina van Dalem-Oskam, chair of the Steering Committee.<note>Glen
						Worthey on behalf of the ADHO Steering Committee, email message to
						Élika Ortega, Ernesto Priani, and Isabel Galina. June 2, 2016. </note>
					Thus Élika Ortega was appointed explicitly in a <quote rend="inline"
						>non-voting vice chair in an advisory role,</quote> a position created
					by ADHO’s Steering Committee — the first, and only such appointment. It was
					only later that Ortega, a junior scholar, was granted the title of
						<q>co-chair</q> with decision-making and voting authority equal to
					that of Glen Worthey, her white, male, senior colleague.<note>The role of
							<q>PC Co-Chair</q> was an entirely new one at the time. The model
						of electing two PC Co-Chairs has continued since then — a rather
						modest innovation with positive outcomes that we support
						wholeheartedly.</note> Additionally, the long duration of the
					appointments — generally 24 months minimum — makes participation by those
					occupying staff and non-faculty positions particularly challenging. When
					committee members are not appointed by the beginning of the two-year term,
					it impacts the functionality of the program committee. As Manfred Thaller
					notes in his official report, DH2016 struggled with the constituent
					organizations’ late-appointments of program committee members less than a
					year prior to the conference which meant there wasn’t sufficient time to
					determine collective conference priorities for the program.<note>The
						Alliance for Digital Humanities Organizations does not publicly make
						available reports from the program committee, local organizing
						committee, or the conference coordinating committee. For the purposes
						of this article, the authors solicited copies of past reports from the
						program committee chairs who then agreed to have their work made
						available for this article. (<ref target="#conclusion">See our
							conclusion</ref> for recommendations on transparency and
						consistency in documentation.)</note> The adoption of at-large
					positions is one potential way forward that might address issues of rank,
					diversity, and representation beyond the academy by allowing anyone within
					the digital humanities community the opportunity to serve. But so too would
					addressing the need for compensation for the work of the program committee.
					Solving structural imbalances in the composition of the program committee
					goes beyond the conference program committee and its chairs, but needs to
					be acknowledged in the conference’s decision making processes.</p>

				<head>The Greatest Show of All: Setting the Tone with Conference Themes</head>
				<p>Although conference themes might not initially seem as important as
					logistical factors of venue, budget, and local resources that are taken
					into consideration as much when teams bid to host the conference, we
					believe them to be crucial as guiding principles in decision making
					processes. For example, the theme of the 2018 conference, <title
						rend="quotes">Bridges/Puentes,</title> strongly influenced the
					crafting of the call for papers (CfP) and the inclusion of topics such as
					the collaborative relationships between scholars from the Global North and
					the Global South; different practices and epistemologies across
					geopolitical realities, and others. Similarly, this theme guided the
					gathering of presentations over the basis of a shared topic, approach, or
					methodology rather than by language as it was historically done. This
					yielded, for example, a session in art history with presentations in
					English, Spanish, and Portuguese, instead of, for instance, a session in
					Spanish on a multitude of topics. In addition to being hosted in a large
					French-speaking city, DH2017’s theme <title rend="quotes"
						>Access/Accès</title> also signaled the bilingualism of the conference
					which included not only a French language keynote, but also sessions where
					all the presentations were in French. Likewise, DH2020’s theme <title
						rend="quotes">Carrefours/Intersections</title> signaled the
					conference’s commitment to emphasizing and supporting French-language
					digital humanities scholarship, reflecting <quote source="#dh2020cd"
						rend="inline">the geographical and cultural heritage of Ottawa, a
						bilingual city in unceded Algonquin territory</quote>
					<ptr target="#dh2020cd"/>.<note>Please see the full CFPs, archived at Laura
						Estill, Jennifer Guiliano, Élika Ortega, Melissa Terras, Deb
						Verhoeven, and Glen Worthey, <title rend="quotes">Alliance for Digital
							Humanities Digital Humanities Conference Calls for Papers:

						of the in-person DH2020 event, the organizers offered the wish that
							<quote source="#dh2020c" rend="inline">ADHO, and all of its COs,

							responsible to do so</quote>
						<ptr target="#dh2020c"/>.</note> Conference themes, by virtue of being
					one of the first choices made about a conference, are one way that the
					conference signals its priorities. </p>
				<p>While much of the content of the CfP is mandated by policy, the conference
					theme is handled separately. At the time of bidding for the conference, the
					local organizers select a theme that resonates either locally with their
					digital humanities community or that they feel best serves the interest of
					the digital humanities communities at large. That theme is shared with the
					executive committee of ADHO and can be subtly shifted based on their
					feedback. As a result, the theme is often prescribed for the Program
					Committee prior to its creation. This can cause tension within the Program
					Committee as the theme should guide the academic program; yet the
					representatives appointed to the Program Committee have no authority to
					change or revise the theme. In the best scenario, the local organizers
					consult with the Program Committee after their appointment on explanations
					and definitions of the theme that will be incorporated into the call for
					papers. At the end of the 2018 conference, DH2019 announced the main theme
					of <title rend="quotes">Complexities</title> which <quote
						source="#dh2019cfpe" rend="inline">suits the very diverse situation in
						Europe and DH at large, and captures the challenge to develop across
						regions and represent more inclusive, global perspectives on
						scholarship and teaching</quote>
					<ptr target="#dh2019cfpe"/>. Local organizers then launched a parallel
					theme of <title rend="quotes">Focus on Africa</title>
					<ptr target="#dh2019foa"/> that was intended to build on their existing
					collaborations with African scholars. While they noted that this was an
					effort to <quote source="#dh2019foa" rend="inline">help open up the
						conference to scholars from an area that is still very much
						underrepresented in the DH community,</quote> concerns quickly arose
					around cost of attendance, that scholarships would only partly cover costs
					of travel and attendance, and that participants in the Africa workshop were
					somehow outside the main conference process. It did not help that the
					announcement was <quote rend="inline">clumsy</quote> as program chairs
					noted. It also was problematic that the workshop was discussed as a <quote
						rend="inline">satellite</quote> event rather than part of the
					conference proper and began a full week prior to the conference workshops
					(thereby increasing housing and meal costs for attendees who hoped to
					attend both). One digital humanist noted their skepticism on <quote
						source="#krautli2019" rend="inline">how a ‘Focus on Africa’ will
						really empower underrepresented communities</quote>
					<ptr target="#krautli2019"/>. Another attendee noted via twitter that there
					were <quote rend="inline" source="#kandeh2019">few perspectives from Africa
						on Africa</quote> at the conference <ptr target="#kandeh2019"/>. The
					carving-off of a portion of conference events to a separate event is not
					unique to 2019. Indeed, there is a track record of portions of the
					conference program being isolated from the main conference including being
					held in separate buildings by themselves (2016’s panel on inclusion and
					accessibility, for instance).</p>
				<p>For DH2020, the local organizing committee and the program committee chairs
					co-drafted a document explaining the theme which was then discussed,
					modified, and endorsed by both full committees. The collaborative work on
					the theme helped ensure that no committee saw it as an imposition. Given
					the broad range of digital humanities topics and interests, the theme is a
					way to narrow the selection of possible keynote presenters as well as to
					signal to potential presenters topics that they might engage with. Most
					themes incorporate a set of sub-themes or topics. This can take the form of
					bullet-pointed lists or, as 2020 did, a set of values statements around
					selected sub-disciplines: of digital first nations and indigenous studies;
					public digital humanities; and open data. Rather than articulate all of
					these details in the main CfP, DH2020 elected to publish a conference
					themes document on the conference website that provided an explanation of
					each sub-discipline and its relationship to the topic of <title
						rend="quotes">Carrefours</title>
					<ptr target="#dh2020cd"/>. The program committee chose the sub-disciplinary
					interests and outlined capacious definitions so potential presenters could
					position their ongoing work within the theme. For DH2020, the program
					committee had planned to go forward with three themed special journal
					issues that would reflect each of the areas outlined, however, because of
					COVID-19, the Ottawa conference did not take place; as such, neither did
					the special issues that would have emerged from that gathering.</p>
				<p>As the most recognized annual international conference in digital humanities,
					the DH conference also welcomes presentations on ongoing research
					regardless of its connection to the conference’s theme. This manifests a
					tension between submissions that adhere to the conference theme and those
					that do not. It is the determination of the program committee what value,
					if any, to assign submissions that align to the theme. For DH2020, the
					program committee, in consultation with the local organizers, conference
					coordinating committee, and executive board, chose to weight the theme as
					ten percent of the consideration for peer reviewing applications. The
					Program Committee wished to directly acknowledge the three sub-disciplinary
					areas as vital to the intellectual breadth and depth of the conference.
					Part of the rationale for this was the local appeal to scholars working on
					these topics; chairs also wanted the digital humanities community to
					consider these sub-disciplines as a coherent set of interests. The decision
					to weight <q>theme</q> at ten percent was ultimately frustrating for both
					the Program Committee and the submitters. A handful of individuals pushed
					back against measuring submissions in relation to theme, preferring a
					nominal theme that is not actually considered in relation to submissions.
					In some cases, the discontent stemmed from long-standing digital humanists
					not seeing their research interests reflected in the three sub-disciplines
					chosen for that year’s conference; others noted that past practice had not
					evaluated submissions in relation to conference themes. This concern was
					expressed in direct emails from participants and peer reviewers as well as
					in peer reviewers’ uneven deployment of the category <q>relation to
						theme</q> from the peer review rubric. Uneven evaluative actions were
					not reserved for thematic weighting alone; previous Program Committees have
					expressed similar sentiments about evaluation in other categories. The
					rubric (including the criteria on which submissions were evaluated and
					their weight) was circulated in advance so that everyone submitting could
					tailor their applications accordingly. Yet, attempts to align submission
					abstracts to review criteria varied widely. </p>
				<p>In the future, the Conference Coordinating Committee, Local Organizers, and
					Program Committee will need to decide on the value and purpose of having a
					themed conference, or perhaps decide to jettison the notion of themes
					altogether. While the first would make it easier for submitters and the
					program committee to complete their work, the lack of a theme may guide the
					conference away from coherence. For scholars invested in emerging fields
					that are reflected in the sub-themes, the loss of the opportunity for the
					larger digital humanities community to consider their importance can be
					quite damaging. Ultimately, conference themes such as DH2011’s <title
						rend="quotes">Big Tent Digital Humanities,</title> can spawn debate,
					affect public discourse beyond the conference itself, and may have long
					lasting reverberations.</p>
				<p>We recommend that program committee chairs (perhaps in concert with the
					conference coordinating committee and the local organizing committee)
					establish and publish their conference’s guiding principles, which can then
					be incorporated into the theme and CfP. We further recommend that program
					committee chairs publicly share the conference’s anticipated and actual
					outcomes based on the established theme. Ultimately, we view conference
					themes as an opening through which ADHO and annual organizers can reach out
					to scholars and scholarship that may have been overlooked or outright
					ignored.</p>

				<head>Come One, Come All: Reaching the Community with the Call For Proposals
					(Call for Papers/Call for Presentations)</head>
				<p>A vital part of conference planning is the solicitation of participation to
					potential attendees, both those who are existing members of the association
					and those who might join in order to participate in the conference.
					Generally, membership enrollment spikes for organizations who are
					supporting the conference occuring in their geographical locale. The CfP
					serves as the first element of outreach to participants. It guides
					potential attendees in understanding both the mechanics of the conference
					(dates, submission formats, etc.) as well as the placement of the
					conference within the ecosystem of disciplinary conventions. These
					practices are not just ethical questions related to submitting one’s own
					original work and participating in single-anonymous, double-anonymous, or
					open peer review;<note>For more on inclusive terminology about peer review,
						see <title rend="quotes">Editorial</title> in <ptr
							target="#gough_etal2021"/>).</note> they are also statements that
					communicate values around diversity, inclusion, and accessibility. Does the
					conference welcome submissions in multiple languages, or formats? Does the
					call include statements related to codes of conduct and guidance on the
					accessibility of presentation materials? And, as importantly, does the call
					for papers clearly articulate how submission decisions will be reached? Do
					submissions need to comply with criteria such as racial, gender,
					representation, or status balance on panels or forums? Does it welcome
					submissions by those outside academic ranks? Each of these questions serves
					to broaden or limit the potential pool of participants. </p>
				<p>At the annual international digital humanities conference, the call for
					papers process is prescribed and supervised by ADHO’s Conference
					Coordinating Committee (CCC). The CCC provides to every program committee a
					template that outlines not just what content should be included in the CfP
					but also the placement of elements within the CfP in relation to one
					another. It is guided by the <q>Conference Protocols</q> which were created
					in order to standardize conference procedures from year to year and also to
					help organizers, who come to the position new each year. The conference is
					organized on a rolling basis. As such, at any given time, there are three
					conference planning groups running: the current conference process, the
					past conference teams as they close out their activities such as publishing
					proceedings, and future conference groups who are learning about the
					activities they will need to participate in. While there is overlap in
					representation from the same organizations, very rarely is there overlap
					with the individual members assigned. As such, conference protocols are
					designed to reduce potential errors or issues, both known and unknown, for
					organizers, committee members, and participants as they move through one of
					the three stages. Manfred Thaller noted that <quote rend="inline">the
						relationship between [the program committee and the conference
						coordinating committee] has been rather vaguely defined</quote>
					<ptr target="#thaller2016"/> , particularly in relation to when the PC
					needs to seek approval from the CCC. He further highlights the
					inconsistency of involvement of the chair of the conference coordinating
					committee in supervising program committee work. In 2019, Diane Jakacki and
					Brian Croxall, chairs of the Conference Coordinating Committee, undertook
					the task of rewriting the conference protocols: the new protocols were to
					be applied to the 2021 conference (which, due to COVID-19, has been pushed
					back a year); yet, even with ongoing revisions to the protocols, the
					ongoing debate over the relationship between the conference coordinating
					committee, the local organizing committee, and the program committee
					continues. The kinds of questions covered by the conference protocols
					include: What types of presentations will the conference have? Is there a
					conference theme or set of topics that will guide conference interests? How
					will submissions be reviewed? By whom will the program ultimately be
					decided? While these may seem simple mechanistic questions that are
					formulaic, the reality is that each of these questions is situated within a
					set of conventions that implicitly and explicitly communicate disciplinary
					standards and value-systems. Every member who participates in the process
					brings with them their own disciplinary and personal predispositions to
					organizing the conference. </p>
				<p>Any changes to the template, be it language of publication, variation to
					submission deadline dates, the introduction of new formats or criteria for
					submission, or the excision of elements from the template, have to be
					reviewed and approved by the CCC who generally consult with the Executive
					officers. The ADHO CfP is created each year by the program committee, whose
					chairs and members change for every conference. Each program committee
					draws on previous years’ CfPs: as you can see from the appended calls from
					2015-2020, some sections were retained over the years. This was a
					purposeful policy on ADHO’s part in order to minimize the labor of
					translating the call into multiple languages; however, it also constrained
					program committees from innovation, acknowledging the rapid changes in the
					field, or even addressing existing challenges. So, for example in 2015, the
					program committee was expressly forbidden from varying the CfP in their
					content or structure. Translation of new material would be too costly and
					time-consuming; this despite the fact that ADHO does not fund translation
					activities and that program chairs often must use their own personal
					resources to fund translation. Coupled with this, in 2015, even without
					variation to the CfP, there were no translators available for some
					languages. Translation may also be limited at the request of local
					organizers. In 2019, local organizers declined to have the call for papers
					translated into Dutch claiming that <quote source="#ciotti_etal2019"
						rend="inline">most of the academic communication in the Netherlands
						happens in English</quote>
					<ptr target="#ciotti_etal2019"/>. While this was likely correct, the
					question of whether the lack of translation to Dutch limited potential
					contributions from those outside the English-speaking academic community
					remained unanswered.</p>

				<head>Three Ring Circus?: <q>Peer,</q>
					<q>Review,</q> and Peer Review</head>
				<p>It may not be immediately obvious, but important opportunities to enact any
					kind of changes to the conference program, including adherence to the
					theme, linguistic, regional, and disciplinary diversity, rely on the peer
					review process.<note>For more on the challenges with peer review, including
						anonymity, quality of reviewed work, and reviewer behavior, see <ptr
							target="#eve_etal2021"/>.</note> Peer review offers potential
					that is matched with unexpected risks for failure. Conference protocols,
					developed by ADHO’s Conference Coordinating Committee and used for planning
					the event, dictates that program committees are unable to implement changes
					in the peer review process without approval. This has included in previous
					iterations of the protocols limiting the expansion of the reviewer pool to
					a biannual process despite need for new reviewers, as well as mandating a
					process of <term>review bidding</term> that was implemented to encourage
					participation by reviewers, but may have had unintended negative
					consequences, such as favoritism. For example, most of the procedural
					changes implemented for DH2018 in Mexico City (e.g., expanding the reviewer
					pool during an <q>off-cycle</q> year; abandoning the review bidding phase;
					and moving to double-anonymous peer review) were motivated specifically by
					the desire to make space for scholars from Latin America in the program.
					The existing approved review pool had limited Spanish-speaking reviewers so
					an expansion of the pool was clearly in order; Latin American scholars who
					had previously submitted to the conference had received hostile or
					uncollegial reviews. Moving to an expanded pool of reviewers and the
					double-anonymous review process was intended to alleviate those issues. </p>
				<p>Complicating all peer review processes for the DH conferences is the use of
					the <ref target="https://www.conftool.net/">ConfTool</ref> management
					system, which utilizes both a manual and automatic review assignment
					process <ptr target="#conftool"/>. ConfTool is a commercial service that
					ADHO licenses each year. Every year, the previous year’s ConfTool database
					is imported into a new ConfTool instance, a functionality that has
					advantages for organizers and participants. Past participants don’t need to
					create a new login account or state their review expertise topics;
					organizers have a ready-made mailing list and review information already
					available to the program committee. Carrying over this database, however,
					also reiterates outdated user information (such as the use of deadnames,
					that is, original birth names after an individual has altered their name)
					as well as biases (listing some subfields and not others) that may have
					been incorporated in previous conference processes. For example, there may
					be missing expertise fields, scholars may not update their expertise to
					align to new areas of work, or there may be reviewers who remain within the
					reviewer pool despite issues around code of conduct. Noting below how
					ConfTool shapes the organization and the DH conference, we are also aware
					that every conference management tool will have its own issues. However,
					there has been no systematic evaluation of how ConfTool structures affect
					decision-making, organization, labor issues, and other crucial conference
					functions.</p>
				<p>In ConfTool, once all submissions have been received with keywords selected
					and all reviewers have been marked with reviewer status, the automatic
					assignment system identifies conflicts of interests between submissions and
					potential reviewers. When conflicts have been identified, the algorithm
					tries to find <quote source="#conftool" rend="inline">the best reviewers
						for each paper (so not the best papers for each reviewer)</quote>
					<ptr target="#conftool"/>. In some years, this includes considering
					reviewer preferences (known as the <q>bidding process</q>) for particular
					review assignments. Most years, though, the algorithm moves directly to
						<quote source="#conftool" rend="inline">matching topics according to
						the areas of expertise</quote> (counting down from the highest number
					of matches to one, e.g., five, four, three, two, one matches between areas
					of expertise and topics selected by the authors). Finally, the algorithm
					attempts to assign to those with the fewest number of reviews assigned to a
					given reviewer. While this sounds logical, the algorithm is limited in
					three key ways. First, the algorithm does not accommodate submissions and
					reviewer expertise outside of the English language. Thus, you cannot assign
					Spanish-language submissions, for example, only to reviewers who are fluent
					in Spanish. Instead, you must manually match those with multilingual
					expertise to those submissions that are in that language adding significant
					labor to the work of program chairs. Second, complicating manual assignment
					is that ConfTool has no specific mechanism for differentiating the language
					of presentation from the content of the submission. As a result, program
					chairs have to incorporate language proficiency in the default user
					profiles and then manually match that information to the topical fields
					related to language. Because many authors either fail to mark the language
					of presentation, assume that the system will automatically identify
					multilingual submissions, or confuse the topic of research (on Mexico, for
					example) with the desire to submit and present in Spanish, program chairs
					either must review all submissions to ensure the correct languages are
					selected or, as most program chairs have done, manually assign all
					non-English submissions first outside the algorithmic assignment process.
					While in some languages there may only be a handful of submissions,
					depending on the year and location the number of non-English submissions
					can be quite large. This leads to the third problem which is that there is
					no way to weight or sequence the algorithm processing of topical keywords.
					Program chairs cannot prioritize matching linguistic proficiencies first
					before topics such as discipline or geography. As a result, the algorithm
					may identify a high match of four or five topics and none of them relate to
					linguistic ability resulting in a reviewer being unable to review a
					submission. While individually these issues can be resolved through
					creative solutions and human engineering, the underlying issue of the
					algorithm illustrates an English bias that undermines diversity efforts.
					Given the international nature of the conference, the inability of the
					ConfTool system to accommodate multilingualism and complexity in reviewer
					assignment and submission information is quite problematic. As Elena
					Pierazzo and Fabio Ciotti noted in their 2019 chairs report, <quote
						source="#ciotti_etal2019" rend="inline">no automatic system will solve
						all the problems, nor an absolute and mechanic reliance on external
						peer review is acceptable in all cases</quote>
					<ptr target="#ciotti_etal2019"/>.</p>
				<p>The manual assignment of reviewers and the expansion of the multilingual
					reviewer pool are invisible to most but are key for the success of the
					review process. These two efforts can have positive repercussions in the
					acceptance of proposals that under different review bodies with particular
					merit standards might not be ranked positively, in the overall composition
					of the program, and ultimately in the overall proceedings of the
					conference. Difficulties to enact changes such as these include making
					proposals to the CCC that justify a deviation from the protocols and usages
					at the time. That is in addition to the work of reaching out to reviewers,
					vetting them, and maintaining good communication. These are challenges for
					every conference but are especially pressing for conferences being hosted
					for the first time by a member association. DH2018, the first to take place
					in the Global South, was especially burdened as missteps in the conference
					process would impact both future hosting abilities as well as the potential
					growth of local membership.</p>
				<p>For many years, the standard modality of peer review for the international DH
					conference was single-anonymous: anonymous reviewers were able to see the
					names of proposal authors. This practice not only was fairly non-standard
					in academia, but also entailed a lack of balance and equity between
					reviewers and submission authors <ptr target="#okike_etal2016"/>; <ptr
						target="#tompkins_etal2017"/>. Although at various times,
					single-anonymous reviewing was questioned in the ADHO community, there was
					considerable resistance (and perhaps marginal or marginalized motivation)
					to change it. Because participants in the conference come from varied
					institutional, geographic, and disciplinary backgrounds, however, many
					people bring different expectations for peer review to the conference
					itself.</p>
				<p>Changes to the single-anonymous model have been used to try to mitigate these
					concerns, which were widely, if too often quietly, acknowledged by
					conference organizers, delegates, and other practitioners. Uncollegial and
					outright rude review tone, implicit bias, and inappropriate deference to
						<q>stardom</q> were known problems for years. In DH2018, for example,
					the shift to double-anonymous peer review helped prevent both the implicit
					negative biases that might arise from a reviewer reacting to a
					linguistically or culturally coded author’s name or from an institutional
					affiliation. It also addressed an unconscious (or perhaps conscious)
					positive bias in response to seeing a very well-known author. Some of these
					biases were further exacerbated by the <term>review bidding</term> phase
					where potential reviewers had the chance to choose what and whose work to
					evaluate (this practice between 2013 and 2017 has been abandoned). The
					problem of uncollegial tone in reviews was sadly not resolved by the
					double-anonymous approach for 2018. However, double-anonymous peer review
					did have an impact in closing the scoring gaps between well-known scholars
					and newcomers to the conference for both DH2018 and DH2019. Fabio Ciotti
					and Elena Pierazzo noted that double anonymous <quote
						source="#ciotti_etal2019" rend="inline">seems to lower the authority
						bias and help younger and less known scholars to get good
						scores.</quote>
					<ptr target="#ciotti_etal2019"/> DH2019 did, however, experience issues
					around the anonymity of submissions. Some authors failed to properly
					anonymize their contributions while others were overly-anonymized by
					limiting access to websites and other supporting citations that might
					strengthen their contributions <ptr target="#ciotti_etal2019"/>. DH2020
					enacted open peer review where both the reviewer and submitter names were
					known to each other and to the program committee (but reviews were not
					publicly posted). DH2020’s open peer review was met with both criticism and
					praise. Some participants in the digital humanities conference are
					committed to only undertaking open peer review, whereas others can be
					skeptical of its scholarly rigor. Future program committees will need to
					judiciously choose their peer review modality (open, single-anonymous, or
					double-anonymous); and, regardless of the style of peer reviewing selected,
					will need to work to ensure that the review process does not simply
					reinforce existing biases and axes of privilege that cut across the
					conference and community.</p>
				<p>The selection process and the making of the program is the stage of the
					conference where the Program Committee exerts the most power and situates a
					year’s conference in regards to the field. Although the selection process
					might seem to be a mechanical one where a <q>cutoff point</q> in scoring
					separates accepted proposals from those not accepted, in reality, this
					exercise involves a large degree of give and take. There are a variety of
					factors that must necessarily guide the process including the number of
					submissions in various presentation categories (poster, panel, long or
					short paper, etc.); physical limitations of the venue; temporal limitations
					of the conference calendar; diversity of participants (discipline and
					approach; career stage; geographical, linguistic, and cultural background).
					The merit and quality of a proposal may be perceived to be the deciding
					factors, as though the selection process was a competition and acceptance
					to the conference was the prize, one that could signal membership to the
					digital humanities community and room in the <q>Big Tent.</q> Complicating
					the question of acceptance is the rapidly increasing scale of the
					conference which has seen exponential growth in both the number of
					submissions and the number of individuals involved in the conference
					process through reviewing. DH2015, for example, as the table below
					outlines, saw 426 submissions with 371 approved reviewers. DH2019, just
					four years later, saw 893 submissions with an active reviewer pool of 661
						individuals.<note>Importantly, DH conferences held in Europe tend to
						trend higher in submissions while the number of reviewers remains
						relatively consistent. This is both a factor of the growth of DH in
						the many European nations as well as the proximity of the conference
						to various European nations. See Table 1 and Table 2 for an overview
						of submissions by type and the number of reviews.</note>

				<p>A rejection notification is sometimes met with push-back, privately and/or
					publicly, arguing for the quality of a proposal, the precedent of having
					been accepted in previous years, or, from another stance, the gatekeeping
					of the field and the lack of diversity. As has been proven, merit in the
					academy is not an equitable measurement of success or rewards, but rather a
					skewed one where resources are allocated to those who already have them.
					Thus, an assumption of the fairness of rewarding merit can only lead to a
					feedback loop where success is granted only (or mostly) to those who are
					already successful <ptr target="#weingart2016"/>. Should merit then be
					centered as the deciding factor of acceptance? We contend that it
					shouldn’t. Instead, program committees should prioritize a deliberate
					curatorial approach: a local language, under-recognized academic
					approaches, justice and equity, etc. Conference themes (discussed above)
					might assist in that effort; however, without thematic alignment being
					represented in the review criteria, thematic efforts might be ignored. A
					look at the history of the conference offers examples of both.</p>
				<p>In 2018, for example, the program co-chairs centered the location of the
					conference, which afforded many digital humanists in Latin America the
					possibility of attending due to proximity, fewer (or no) visa requirements,
					and lower costs, in their curation of the program. Rather than relying on
					the metrics of merit (scoring) alone, the program chairs focused on
					ensuring that the percentage of presentations accepted from practitioners
					based in Latin America roughly matched the percentage of submissions
					initially received from the region. This labor was strongly facilitated by
					the work already done by the reviewers who not only had various linguistic
					and disciplinary backgrounds, but also, crucially, came from varied
					academic cultures so that a single notion of merit, quality, or value did
					not dominate. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the single notion that dominated
					prior efforts in addressing inequity in review was the centering of
					tenure-track and tenured faculty who sought to uphold the privilege of
					degree, access to publication venues, and the reification of citational
					privilege. As the 2018 chairs learned from this example, evaluation must
					not only deal with linguistic competency, but must also consider cultural,
					contextual, and citational practices fairly. We suggest that there is no
					innate, universal knowledge that all scholars should have; rather, we are
					suggesting that the notion of what is appropriate academic practice varies
					greatly and can be weaponized against those who are not engaged with North
					American and European digital humanities as led by the tenured and those on
					the tenure track.</p>

				<p>Although protocols outline that the program committee determines conference
					acceptance, in practicality members of the ADHO Executive have had
					significant interest in acceptance rates. For instance, in 2020, ADHO
					provided suggested baseline thresholds for acceptance and rejection without
					examining the submissions or their reviews; in 2015, there was significant
					tension around acceptance rates given the venue location (Sydney,
					Australia). Further, there is a disconnect between the desire by ADHO to
					maintain a stance of exclusivity in relationship to acceptance and
					rejection rates and the inverse desire for the conference to serve as a
					gathering opportunity for the entirety of the field that generates revenue.
					There are significant financial implications to exclusivity as it limits
					the potential income of the conference. As conference income is dispersed
					among the member organizations, choices to cap the number of presenters
					also limit the amount of disbursements to organizations in the year
					following. This can then directly impact the constituent organizations and
					their activities.</p>
				<p>A centering of what might seem priorities alternative to merit for the
					selection and crafting of the program has important ramifications for the
					scholarly dialogue not just across disciplines, methodologies, but also
					academic cultures. All conferences are exclusionary in some way. But
					awareness of that exclusion needs to be not only attended to but also
					openly addressed where possible. Successive Digital Humanities conferences
					have consistently attempted to just add more concurrent sessions as if that
					would address issues of exclusion and merit; yet, in our experience and
					analysis, additional sessions do not necessarily translate into a more
					diverse conference program, rather it provides more opportunities to those
					already centered within the field. Ultimately, centering specific
					disciplines, themes, or locales can offer new points of departure for our
					initial questions, what is the conference supposed to <emph>do</emph>, and
					what is it <emph>for</emph>? </p>

				<head>Just the Tonic?: Keynote Speakers at the ADHO Conference</head>
				<p>The word <term>keynote</term> is derived from the practice of playing a note
					at the outset of a musical performance in order to establish the key <ptr
						target="#oed2021a"/>. Typically, this would be the lowest note (the
					tonic) of the musical scale. From the early 1900s, the noun has been used
					as a verb to describe presentations which set the prevailing tone or
					essential ideas of a meeting <ptr target="#oed2021b"/>; <ptr
						target="#kelly2016"/>. Built into the very idea of the keyote then, is
					a sense of establishing or leading the development of harmonious
					relationships, of providing the conditions for collaborative expression at
					scale. </p>
				<p>Academic conferences carry this meaning into the organization of keynotes or
					plenary speakers. A keynote speaker is expected to represent leadership in
					a given field, signaling both evident accomplishment and simultaneously
					pointing to the directions that the discipline (and more specifically the
					conference) might follow. Keynotes are a matter-of-course event within the
					format of many intellectual meetings. Yet there have been few analyses
					undertaken of either the selection or content of keynote speeches, and how
					they both signify and enact prestige, power, hierarchy, and direction of
					travel for the discipline.<note>See Di Chiro for an analysis of keynote
						talks that mention the Anthropocene <ptr target="#dichiro2016"/>. We
						have found no other such analysis around particular themes or topics.
					</note> In complex, manifold fields such as the Digital Humanities there is
					a tradition of inviting two to three (and in some years up to five) keynote
					speakers to cover developments in the many distinct strands of research
					undertaken by the scholarly community. Typically, a keynote address is
					delivered by a soloist and there is no competing program event to distract
					conference attendees. The presenter is expected to speak authoritatively on
					their area of expertise for forty to forty-five minutes with a short
					opportunity for questions from the floor.</p>
				<p>The selection of ADHO keynote speakers is one of the first and one of the
					trickiest tasks of the conference programming committee after CfP creation
					for a number of reasons. In order to attract keynote speakers the
					conference covers travel, accommodation and registration fees. As there is
					no guarantee that the speaker(s) desired most by the Program Committee will
					agree, the complex logistics of these arrangements require invitations to
					be sent early. The announcement of keynote speakers is crucial in promoting
					the conference and attracting attendees — the earlier they are confirmed
					the higher the potential impact on the budget that pays their way by
					encouraging registration of potential attendees. The proposed keynotes are
					then required to satisfy both the expectations of the programming committee
					(to be of sufficient academic standing in relation to the conference themes
					and lines of enquiry) and the local organizers (to be sufficiently
					recognizable to market the conference and generate registrations). This can
					give rise to delicate, and not always harmonious, negotiations between the
					Chair(s) of the Programming Committee and the Local Organizer(s). The
					intensity of these negotiations are directly proportional to the stakes for
					the organizers which extend beyond the terms of the conference itself. For
					example, there are implicit career and professional network benefits to
					conference organizers in a position to offer keynotes to more senior and
					influential figures in the field. Often organizers garner individual or
					small group type activities with speakers that can foster collaboration or
					reciprocal invitations. There can also be a sense of obligation to invite
					specific individuals based at the university hosting the conference or
					located in the country in which it takes place. Not inviting a leading
					figure at one’s university or national network can have professional
					consequences. There are also professional opportunities for invited
					keynotes that they might otherwise not have. These types of presentations
					for tenure, or promotion, are taken as an indicator of value and prestige
					within the academic system. Often, speakers will then be invited to give
					additional talks at other conferences and institutions by those in
					attendance as a result of having seen them speak.<note>Discussing academic
						conferences in general, Demeter contends, <quote source="#demeter2020"
							rend="inline">we should abandon the pathetic practice of inviting
							only central keynote speakers to plenary sessions while enrolling
							our regional peers in parallel sessions, and abandon the myth
							that these practices ensure the value of an international
							conference….International conferences should be international in
							terms of keynote speakers as well, irrespectively of the location
							of the conference</quote>
						<ptr target="#demeter2020" loc="176"/>. </note> There is, then, a
					significant amount of power in both the choosing of academic speakers and
					also for those who accept to speak: the allocation of this power dynamic
					has hitherto been underexplored in digital humanities.</p>
				<p>The strenuous contestation over keynote selection is not surprising given the
					symbolic weight of the keynote as an exemplar of how the digital
					humanities, and academia more broadly framed, is seen to define
						<q>merit</q> in a value judgment that has real-life implications for
					the CVs and career progressions of those offered keynote slots and the
					networks and reputational affordances for those that select them. This
					extends to the awarding of annual prizes at the Digital Humanities
					conference as well. These power issues often have a gendered
						aspect.<note>Please note that while our analysis here focuses on
						gender, there is also a need to undertake an intersectional analysis
						of DH keynote speakers that addresses issues of race, ability, rank,
						and more. We also wish to acknowledge the limitations of the binary
						gender framework within this portion of our analysis which should be
						further explored from a non-binary persepctive.</note> For example,
					the 2013 conference in Nebraska was sharply rebuked by attendees when
					almost all the awards and keynote addresses were offered to those
					identifying publicly as men. It has been noted that although, in binary
					terms, there is near gender parity across attendees of Digital Humanities
					conferences, there is a far higher concentration of men presenting standard
					papers <ptr target="#eichmannkalwara_etal2018"/>. But, given that the
					conference is made up of parallel sessions, each conference participant can
					only attend a select number of these and it is impossible to personally
					experience the power disparity at full scale. Keynote and plenaries are a
					different matter since there are no competing events and all conference
					attendees can be in the room for the one session. On the first day of
					proceedings at the 2015 conference, in which only men were seen on stage
					(nine of them, one after another), a vigorous backchannel twitter
					discussion arose in response to what was described as the <quote
						rend="inline">parade of the patriarchs</quote> (<ref
						target="#figure01">See Figure 1</ref>). </p>

				</figure>
				<p>We used a <term>Content Analysis recursive methodology</term>
					<ptr target="#krippendorff2018"/> to look at gender distribution in the
					keynotes of Digital Humanities conferences. For 31 years of ADHO
					conferences (1990-2020 inclusive) we analyzed the gender of invited keynote
					speakers (assessed by pronouns used by the speakers themselves in the
					published record). To the best of our knowledge there were no explicit
					non-binary keynote speakers, an omission which itself demands reflection
					and redress. There were 73 keynote speaker slots (counting repeating
					individuals and <q>duets</q> in which two speakers filled a slot): these
					went to men 51 times, and women 22 times. There were 67 unique speakers (47
					men, and 20 women). 5 individuals had been asked to deliver a keynote
					multiple times: Burrows (3), Drucker (2), Queman (2), Aguera (2) and
					McCarty (2). There were 12 conferences with men-only keynotes: 3
					conferences with women-only keynotes, and 7 conferences where there were
					equal numbers of keynotes. If we were to aim to achieve parity, assuming
					that there will be only two unique keynote speaker slots at future
					conferences, we would need to program women-only keynotes for the next 15
					years of conferences, until 2035. This deficit persists despite the fact
					that gender disparities in keynote addresses have improved in more recent
					times: in the first 8 years of conferences in our data only men gave
					keynotes. Since 2012 there has been at least one woman keynote speaker at
					each of the conferences. In some instances, this opportunity has been
					created by expanding the number of keynotes presented rather than not
					including men speakers. In other words, there haven't been fewer men. The
					last all-men keynote line-up was 2011 which had four men keynote speakers
					(including a closing keynote presented jointly by two men). But, as noted,
					the pace of change is not enough to deliver on the promise of parity for
					some time to come. </p>
				<p>The homophily of keynote invitations is further underscored in an analysis of
					the institutional affiliations of speakers. Of the 73 keynote speaking
					roles — with some keynote sessions involving two speakers — 72 reported an
					institutional (almost always academic) affiliation. Over a third (25)
					worked for European institutions and it should be noted that 50% (36) were
					located at universities and research institutes in the USA and Canada. The
					entire, vast and various, rest of the world (ROW) contributed only 11
					speakers. Many of these 11 were programmed in the most recent three
					conferences. To put that a different way: in the first 22 years of the
					conference (1990-2011) there were only two keynote presentations in which
					the speaker was affiliated with an institution outside Europe and North
					America — and both those presentations were given by the same man (John
					Burrows from the University of Newcastle in Australia). Four years later,
					in 2015, the conference was finally located, for the first time, outside
					either Europe or USA/Canada in Sydney (Australia). By this time (including
					the 2015 Sydney conference) the accumulated ROW keynotes numbered seven,
					three of which had been delivered by the one man, again — John Burrows. Men
					are uniformly overrepresented as a proportion of speakers in this
					geo-locational analysis — the same percentage (72%) of the speaking roles
					in the Europe/UK and USA/Canada cohorts respectively were filled by men. As
					a proportion of the ROW women make up 36% of the total speaker slots which
					expands to 44% if we adjust for <q>Burrowing,</q> i.e. the effect of
					repeated keynote appearances by John Burrows. Based on an analysis of the
					aggregate numbers alone, if you want to secure selection as a keynote
					presenter at an ADHO conference, it would help to be a white man, ideally
					based at a North American institution and preferably named John (or a
					variation thereof).</p>
				<p>The practice of equity and diversity is something to be publicly enacted,
					modeled, and celebrated: to be put <q>center stage</q> (both literally and
					figuratively). Some conference organizers but to our mind, not nearly
					enough have worked consciously to ensure that people from historically
					under-represented groups occupied prominent positions at the conference,
					including the delivery of keynotes. Most often, and despite the best
					efforts of these individual conference chairs, the program has not
					delivered on rudimentary equity and diversity baselines, notably in terms
					of keynote speakers. We must ask the community: why? </p>
				<p>In part, the selection of keynotes often relies on issues of academic
					prestige and rank. Senior scholars who are overwhelmingly male and white
					within digital humanities contexts have, as we’ve demonstrated, been
					rewarded with keynote opportunities. There is a general reluctance for
					keynotes to be assigned to those who aren’t well-known within national or
					global digital humanities. This then reproduces their notoriety.
					Problematizing the selection of keynotes is the requirement that local
					organizers have input on keynote selection. This can manifest in conflicts
					over whether a potential speaker will be appealing enough to encourage
					people to register for the conference. It can also manifest in local
					organizers strongly desiring a given speaker to recognize someone from
					their own national contexts. Neither program committees nor local
					organizers are without blame in this dynamic; the conflict between them is
					baked in through the conference protocols where the local organizers budget
					for the keynote which leads them to further want input into the selection.
					While the keynote is technically part of the academic program, the
						<q>sale-ability</q> of the person is of utmost concern as there is a
					perception that the keynote might attract participants who otherwise might
					not attend. </p>
				<p>Equity is both an outcome <emph>and</emph> a process. Without greater
					transparency and accountability, justice for underrepresented communities
					will not be delivered by the ADHO conference. It is not without some small
					measure of irony that a Digital Humanities conference system is unable to
					apply even a small number of data-driven approaches to implementing open
					decision making and transparent answerability to the digital humanities
					community. In addition to the regional and linguistic profile of speakers,
					we support an intentional effort to bring to the forefront practices that
					are not necessarily in the current core of the field. To our minds, some of
					the most memorable keynote speeches have shared an interest in presenting
						<emph>other</emph> ways of seeing, understanding, and computing the
					world. They have also had in common an emphasis on how digital technologies
					can be used for ethnic, cultural, epistemological, and sometimes physical
					survival. We therefore suggest that it should be a prerequisite in
					conference organization protocols to pledge to have a multiplicity of
					genders across keynote invitations, with weighting towards non-male members
					of academic staff, to give them access to the prestige mechanisms which
					exist within our scholarly societies, that will go on to impact their
					careers. </p>

				<head>Cirque Magique: Multilingualism </head>
				<p>Historically, English has been the default working language of The Alliance
					of Digital Humanities Organizations and, therefore, of the conference and
					of the program committee. As Quinn Dombrowski and Patrick Burns note, the
					field of digital humanities itself has an <quote
						source="#dombrowski_etal2022" rend="inline">English problem</quote>
					<ptr target="#dombrowski_etal2022"/>.<note>For more on the (lack of)
						multilingualism in digital humanities: <ptr target="#spence_etal2021"
						/>, <ptr target="#horvath2021"/>, <ptr target="#dombrowski"/>, and
						others. There was also a DH2019 workshop on the topic <title
							rend="quotes">Towards Multilingualism in Digital
							Humanities</title>
						<ptr target="#lee_etal2019"/>.</note> Acknowledging the hegemony of
					English and the academic cultures it represents, ADHO has for a long time
					had a stated purpose of fostering and increasing the representation of
					ethnic, racial, linguistic, gender, and national digital humanists. The
					creation of the Committee on Multi-Lingualism &amp; Multi-Culturalism
					committee (MLMC) in 2005 is evidence of this aspiration <ptr
						target="#adhomlmcc"/>. For ADHO’s annual DH conference, in particular,
					the Conference Code of Conduct directs us to <quote source="#adhoccoc"
						rend="inline">work actively toward the creation of a more diverse,
						welcoming, and inclusive global community of digital humanities
						scholars and practitioners</quote>
					<ptr target="#adhoccoc"/>. The creation of MLMC and a lack of other bodies
					tasked with overseeing equity in terms of gender, ability, career stage,
					etc. signals how linguistic diversity and multiculturalism have been used
					as shorthand for <q>general</q> diversity. At its best, if actually coupled
					with multiculturalism, linguistic diversity could serve as a proxy for
					regional and epistemological diversity, but there has already been a
					struggle to enact that alignment.</p>
				<p>For one, the centrality of these principles and the concrete ways they are
					applied has rested with the conference organizing and program committees,
					which change personnel and priorities on a yearly basis. Moreover, MLMC has
					ex officio representation on these committees but has no budget and no
					direct responsibility or authority for the actions of the committee — or of
					ADHO in general. Indeed, the responsibilities of the MLMC for the
					conference have been narrowly focused on coordinating the translation of
					the CfP from English to ADHO’s other four official languages: French,
					Spanish, German, and Italian. Translations into other languages – Polish in
					Krakow 2016 <ptr target="#dh2016"/>, Portuguese in 2018 <ptr
						target="#dh2018"/>, and Anishinàbemiwin/Algonquin in Ottawa 2020 <ptr
						target="#dh2020a"/> – have often fallen onto program committee chairs
					or local organizers to do themselves or to obtain funding to pay for
					translation services. The contradictory aspiration of diversity through
					multilingualism, the lack of influence from MLMC, and the annually
					diverging approaches of conference organizers have resulted not just on
					radically uneven results from one year to another but, worse, on
					disappointing measures. </p>
				<p>Despite procedures that could be expected to make a difference, as happened
					in DH2014 when the Call for Papers was published in twenty-three languages,
					multilingual participation was extremely low. As Martin Grandjean wrote in
					his report on the result of that appeal, submissions to the conference were
					in only six languages other than English, resulting in just 4.1% of all
					presentations being delivered in French, Spanish, Italian, or German <ptr
						target="#grandjean2014"/>. In this scenario, the aspirations for a
					multilingual conference failed to materialize, and also added additional
					overhead to the peer review process, including identifying and gathering
					enough reviews in minority languages. While those less knowledgeable might
					assume that the lack of participation was a result of an absence of digital
					humanities activities, or worse a deficiency in quality, in areas working
					in those languages, the reality is that the lack of submissions has likely
					been a result of systemic obstacles to multi-lingual participation. This
					includes the patent inadequacy of multilingual affordances in the
					conference management tool, the lack of resources allocated to translation
					efforts, the scarcity of identified peer reviewers willing or able to
					evaluate non-English abstracts, and a lack of outreach to multilingual
					communities who engage in digital humanities practices but do not strictly
					define themselves as digital humanists. </p>
				<p>More unfortunate, however, has been a lack of tolerance for presentations not
					in English from conference delegates. Accounts of conference rooms being
					partially vacated when presentations were offered in Spanish, French,
					German, or Italian have not been rare. This has occurred despite the
					origination and support for the DH Whispers campaign, implemented in 2014
					by Alex Gil and Élika Ortega. Attendees who were willing to help out
					translating to or from any language being used at the conference were able
					to wear a pin that demarcated their willingness to translate in support of
					presenters and audience members <ptr target="#ortega2014"/>. That work was
					incorporated into the Global Outlook: Digital Humanities’ Translation
					Toolkit, a set of recommendations for translation at conferences <ptr
						target="#godh2016"/>. The limitations of these efforts, though, reside
					in the unfunded mandate of this work as well as the linguistic limitations
					associated with the community itself <ptr target="#spence_etal2021"/>.</p>
				<p>Despite having to pay for translations costs, working on translations
					themselves, and having to present and answer questions in their second or
					third language, non-native English speakers have felt coerced into
					submitting proposals and delivering papers in English in order to receive
					the attention of their colleagues. This complex set of organizational and
					cultural attitudes towards multilingual conferencing poses challenges that
					despite concerted efforts have not always panned out. A review of
					conference acceptance data across years shows that while in 2018 (Mexico
					City), about 18% of the accepted papers and posters were in a language
					other than English, this was nearly double the next-highest levels of
					conference multilinguality: there were about 9% non-English proposal
					accepted to the two preceding conferences (Krákow in 2016 and Montréal in
					2017), but prior to 2016, the percentage of non-English papers was most
					often 0% or 1%, with a local high of just 4% in Lausanne in 2014. We have
					to look all the way back to the 2006 conference in Paris (which predates
					both ADHO and its official <q>DH</q> conference designation) to find
					similar linguistic diversity: it included about 10% non-English papers. And
					although the 2016-2018 percentages on multilingualism may appear to
					represent a strongly positive current trend, in fact these statistics have
					since returned to just above their previous extreme low: the 2019 (Utrecht)
					conference included about 2% non-English presentations, and 2020 conference
					(to have been in Ottawa, but canceled due to COVID-19) included about 3%
					non-English acceptances despite a strong local French-speaking digital
					humanities community. </p>
				<p>The most recent four years of the DH conference (2017–2020) offer case
					studies to examine the shifts in the implementation of the stated
					importance of linguistic diversity. DH2017 and DH2018, celebrated in
					Montreal and Mexico City respectively, were both officially bilingual. This
					included bilingual keynote presentations as well as panels that shared a
					topic or methodology but included papers in both languages. This was likely
					facilitated by having members in the program committees and/or the local
					organizers who were fluent in both languages and belonged to scholarly
					communities working across English-French and English-Spanish. We believe
					this may have encouraged submissions by reaching out to immediate networks.
					Conversely, the CfP for DH2019 in Utrecht explicitly stated that <quote
						source="#dh2019cfpe" rend="inline">The primary language of the
						conference will be English, but we warmly invite proposals written in
						other languages for which we have a sufficient pool of peer reviewers
						(German, Italian, French and Spanish)</quote>
					<ptr target="#dh2019cfpe"/>. With a less active approach to
					multilingualism, expectedly, DH2019 saw very low submissions in languages
					other than English. This was particularly pronounced as the accepted
					program was the largest to date in the history of the Digital Humanities
					conference. In contrast, DH2020 in Ottawa explicitly solicited submissions
					in all five required ADHO languages and centered multiculturalism rather
					than linguistic diversity, bringing to the forefront native, indigenous and
					decolonial studies, while also acknowledging Ottawa’s official
					bilingualism. Yet, there were no submissions in Anishinàbemiwin/Algonquin
					and few in French. As a result, <q>the primary language</q> defaulted to
					English despite efforts to welcome non-English submissions. </p>
				<p>As these examples suggest, despite the establishment of the MLMC and being a
					central concern within ADHO, the actual practice of multilingualism has
					varied widely and, unfortunately, has not yielded the diversity results it
					has been expected to — not in terms of linguistic diversity and certainly
					not in equity at large. It is undeniable that English continues to be a
					powerful and useful lingua franca in the field (which has been noted in
					other disciplines, however it has also been noted that this creates an
					excluding barrier in academic discourse in the conference setting <ptr
						target="#fregonese2017"/>. However, it is also one that encodes
					modalities of writing and epistemologies of the academies that use it and
					implied notions of merit. Thus, among the most important obstacles is the
					human infrastructure required to evaluate proposals appropriately as we
					have argued in the section devoted to peer review. Likewise lacking is a
					conference infrastructure capable of accommodating multilingualism at every
					step of the conference process: from the conference management, to the
					publication of the CfP, to the reviewing of proposals, to the proceedings
					of live presentations, and then to the publication of conference papers. </p>
				<p>The aspirations of the conference to be multilingual and for that
					multilingualism to be a conduit for equity and diversity are worth
					pursuing. Nevertheless, we believe that the prism of multilingualism that
					has been favored in ADHO, on its own, is not capacious enough to lead to
					more diversity, a just way of evaluating proposals, or a wider
					understanding of various academic cultures. Moreover, multilingualism is
					also too narrow to foster anti-hegemonic, anti-racist, anticolonial,
					gender-balanced conference practices and operations. Indeed, even in the
					instances where linguistic diversity was central to the conference, it
					alone has done little to address these parallel problems. Aside from
					instances where specific PC chairs have taken action, it has fallen upon
					groups outside of ADHO governance and of the various committees in charge
					of organizing the conference to bring these issues to the forefront. In
					recent years, Global Outlook::Digital Humanities (GO::DH), a special
					interest group, has advocated not just for incorporating multilingualism
					beyond the CfP itself and in presentations and other aspects of the
					conference but also underscored how equity and diversity are multiplex <ptr
						target="#godh"/>.<note>GO::DH’s stated mission is to <quote
							source="#godh" rend="inline">help break down barriers that hinder
							communication and collaboration among researchers and students of
							the Digital Arts, Humanities, and Cultural Heritage sectors in
							high, mid, and low-income economies</quote>
						<ptr target="#godh"/>.</note> A more expansive and deeper
					understanding of equity of diversity that does not rely on language
					representation needs to be deeply and thoroughly integrated into conference
					organization and ADHO governance. </p>
				<p>In consideration of these issues, we urge ADHO to designate funds to
					diversity efforts. This will involve rethinking the role, function, and
					ambit of the Multi-Lingual Multi-Cultural committee (MLMC). Multilingualism
					is not capacious enough for diversity and equity aspirations nor has it
					been evenly applied at past conferences. Similarly, we encourage Local
					Organizers to budget funds for equity and diversity measures from the
					beginning. Elements which should be considered in the budget include live
					and printed translation costs, accessibility measures (<ref
						target="#conclusion">see below</ref>), and funding to support
					participants from underrepresented communities. </p>
				<p>Lastly, we note that in order for ADHO to be accountable when it comes to its
					stated diversity commitments, the conference must gather data on diversity
					and equity and set clear timelines for goals, assessments, and
					consequences. ConfTool could be used to gather data related to biographical
					and demographic details. A standardized post-conference survey, which has
					not been utilized in previous years, could also be useful to gather
					information about what initiatives were effective or not in a given year.
					Further, initiatives demonstrated to be successful must have continuity,
					permanent financial support, and not be abandoned by future PC Chairs when
					they diverge from opinions held by chairs or their constituent
					organizations. </p>

							precedence, and past report authors’ expectations of privacy. Our
							requests and the responses serve to confirm the importance of
							publicly releasing reports and retrospectively releasing
							information from previous conferences.</note> At an absolute
						minimum, these reports should be made available to current and future
						conference organizers at the start of their term. This should include
						information on acceptance statistics and the planning process. </p>
					<p> We also note that ADHO has been <q>risk averse</q> when it comes to
						data practices and conference programming but NOT risk averse when it
						comes to other forms of hazard that it seems completely oblivious to.
						Without a complaints or conflict resolution process the conference is
						exposed to reputational and even legal risk. There is little
						consideration to broader definitions of risk such as the Environment,
						Social and Governance (ESG) risk frameworks that are now widely
						adopted in other sectors. In particular we are concerned that there
						has not been an environmental impact audit of the conference. We also
						must consider more broadly the conflict between specific policies (for
						example data governance) and local hosting institutions whose local
						laws may supersede ADHO policies. </p>
					<p>We recommend that ADHO create a digital preservation policy for
						conference materials, including the books of abstracts, conference
						schedule, reviewer pool, and recordings of keynote talks. Ideally,
						this digital preservation policy would be retrospective where
						possible, allowing the books of abstracts from past conferences to be
						findable from a single place, and, ideally, searchable. In order to
						facilitate this digital preservation, we recommend standardizing
						formats and submission procedures, which could also help with the
						workload involved in creating these materials. We note that having a
						paid ongoing ConfTool administrator would help facilitate this
						standardization.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<head>Budget and Infrastructure</head>
					<p>Despite the finances of the conference being intimately tied to the
						financial health of ADHO constituent organizations, the conference
						budgeting and ADHO finances as a whole are remarkably opaque. An
						assessment is needed regarding how budgets are constructed and aligned
						to organizational values with particular attention to unpaid labor.
						Final budget documents should be made available publicly. Clarity and
						accountability on conference profits and losses are not currently
						discussed publicly; as a result, there needs to be transparency around
						financial models and their implementation, particularly given the
						tension around conference fee costs. Conferences should be transparent
						about the profits versus loss and should identify where all profits
						are being distributed and how they might be used. </p>
					<p>We encourage conference organizers to create and share financial models
						used for conferences. Budgets should reflect the organizations’
						commitments to, for instance, early career scholars, underrepresented
						populations, other precariously employed people, and those who are
						differently-abled. These commitments should be itemized and easily
						identified so that organizations can be held accountable for their
						use. Doing so will not only foster accountability with potential
						communities and partnership but will also allow for reparations for
						previous prejudices and discrimination in the field. We suggest that
						ADHO create paid conference support staff positions whose employment
						is evaluated based on the successful implementation of values and
						priorities. We also suggest that additional funding be devoted to
						deploying and preserving conference websites by ADHO.</p>
					<p>The ConfTool conference system, for all of its powerful capabilities,
						needs to be developed further to address issues around multi-lingual
						submissions, multilingual reviewers, and the review assignment
						algorithm. Given ADHO’s commitment to this tool, there is a need to
						not only have a ConfTool administrator who works across conference
						years but also funds to address the algorithmic bias.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<head>Accessibility</head>
					<p>Each year, the conference hosting venue should undertake a full
						accessibility audit for a range of both visible and invisible
						disabilities and access requirements, such as set out in the UK Event
						Accessibility Guide <ptr target="#broadbent2017"/>. This should be
						broadly framed, from microphones to the requirement for accessible
						buildings, bursaries (students/underwaged/underrepresented), scaled
						registration fees (dependent on employment stage and institutional
						location), on-site support, lactation rooms, quiet rooms, and
						childcare. We recommend that this assessment be part of the selection
						of conference venues, so that accessibility is embedded into the
						choice of local hosts from the outset. We also suggest a
						post-conference assessment on accessibility to ensure accountability
						for these accommodations.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<head>Ethical Labor</head>
					<p>As we’ve noted throughout this article, the ADHO conference would not
						exist without volunteer labor of organizers, reviewers, on-site staff
						etc. Yet, there is little sense regarding the scale of labor being
						used and how that labor might be reproducing inequities — particularly
						for women and Black, Indigenous, Latinx, and other underrepresented
						individuals. ADHO must conduct a study of labor associated with the
						conference to both quantify the amount of time devoted to the
						conference throughout the multiyear cycle but also address how
						volunteer labor might be compensated in the future. That report should
						be made publicly available and must establish accountability
						benchmarks to address inequity. This would likely include a basic
						conference staff that doesn’t change every year to ensure some level
						of continuity and to serve as an institutional memory of why things
						are the way they are. This would be more effective than tasking
						temporary (two-year) volunteer program committee members with learning
						and implementing things anew; additionally, it would be more effective
						than having to ask past PC chairs, a practice that many of us relied
						on when completing our work, that further extends their unpaid service
						to the organization. Additionally, should the conference proceed with
						volunteer labor, that labor should be clearly recognized and
						compensated with in-kind services (for example: free conference
						registration, reduced or free membership in a constituent organization
						for a set number of years, etc.) This is particularly important if
						student-based unpaid labor and those who are precariously employed are
						incorporated into the conference. </p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<head>Embracing Digital Innovations</head>
					<p>Academic conferences were founded in a pre-modern model of knowledge
						exchange that embraced in-person presentation to stimulate sharing.
						This, though, does not address any of the innovations of digital
						sharing which might supersede the in-person event <ptr
							target="#deklerk2021" loc="esp. 124–28"/>. Throughout its long
						life, the ADHO Conference (until the COVID-19 crisis) has been
						belligerently non-digital. The entire organization of the event is
							<q>surprisingly manual</q>. Paper givers are expected to
						physically attend the event — whatever the cost. Posters are expected
						to be printed and pinned to a noticeboard. COVID-19 has given us an
						opportunity to put the <q>digital</q> back into the ADHO conference;
						COVID-19 has also demonstrated the opportunities that can be afforded
						by digital dissemination and virtual gathering models. Taking time
						zone differences into account, however, will be pivotal to make a
						truly global online networking experience.</p>
					<p>To date, many of the complaints about the conference have appeared on
						social media (including Twitter) — in part because reporting
						guidelines are unclear and there is a perception that complaints
						raised directly to the organization are not addressed, or worse,
						hidden. We recommend that conference organizers embrace social media
						as a venue for conversation. An initial step might include a published
						social media policy, an explicitly-identified member of the CCC who is
						charged with social media management, and a public archive of all
						social media associated with the conference. ADHO must recognize that
						formal conference processes can be alienating and thus the community
						and ADHO must embrace both formal and informal complaint processes,
						such as those offered by social media users. </p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<head>Conclusion: Who and How?</head>
					<p>Above, we have outlined some suggestions for what can be done in the
						future, yet, without a consideration of who and how these changes can
						be enacted, the recommendations themselves are for naught. As some
						people may have heard many times, ADHO does not have members; rather,
						ADHO is composed of constituent organizations, which, in turn, have
						members. So then, how do we effect meaningful change? We all agreed to
						be program committee chairs because we felt we were part of a
						community and could contribute to the conference organization process.
						Helping shape a year’s discussion is, indeed, a privilege. Yet, as
						this article has outlined, there are bureaucratic procedures that can
						hamstring program committee chairs and that can exact a mental and
						emotional toll. </p>
					<p>In our shared personal experience, immersing ourselves in the various
						facets of conference organization served to hinder rather than advance
						our commitment to ADHO and curtailed our professional accomplishments
						in the field. For most of us, the experience serving as program chairs
						led to a range of alienating experiences, the severity of which varied
						for each person: implicit and explicit harassment included bullying;
						social media and email harassment and threats; anxiety and depression;
						and professional burnout lasting years beyond the conference years as
						a result of the levels of work
						expected<!-- <ptr target="#earhart2016"/>(Earhart 2016) -->. These
						experiences are not one-offs; they are symptoms of systemic and
						ongoing problems. These costs to us are in addition to the impact of
						this work on our curriculum vitae, where the years serving as
						conference chairs are reflected gaps within our professional
						trajectory. We request that our experiences and concerns be recognized
						as systemically induced and addressed as such, particularly given that
						some perpetrators of these actions include people, mostly men, who
						remained in leadership roles in ADHO and the constituent organizations
						and flourish within the field. These frequently gendered encounters
						have not been recognized within conference processes and are instead
						often framed as personal failures of women chairs rather than issues
						of governance and accountability. </p>
					<p>We call on both the ADHO Constituent Organization Board (COB) and
						Executive Board (EB) to be mindful of the labor, opportunities,
						benefits, and issues we have highlighted here around conference
						organization and hosting, to create a top-down (structural) approach
						to improving the conference for all involved.<note>In the spirit of
							collaboration and dialogue, we sought pre-publication feedback on
							this article from current ADHO officers. These requests for
							feedback were denied. </note> We also call on individual members
						of ADHO constituent organizations to raise issues and pledge support
						for increased conference diversity via their constituent
						organizations, to create a ground-up approach. In particular, senior
						academics in tenured (or similar) positions need to utilize the power
						that they have to bring these issues and suggestions to both ADHO and
						their CO. The issues raised here will not be solved once and for all
						overnight, but will require ongoing vigilance and monitoring to be
						sure that the <q>Big Tent</q> is as open to all as it can possibly be.
						This, in itself is labor — which conference organizing institutions
						should respect. </p>
					<p>Conferences are collaborations that can shape the future of academic
						fields, and individual academic careers. We invite more conferences to
						reflect critically on their practices and how they can best support
						their communities, and believe that the recommendations we have
						provided here for ADHO will be applicable to, and should be considered
						for, most academic events.</p>
