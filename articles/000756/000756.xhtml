                  <p>As commercial tabletop and video games become increasingly popular throughout the
                     world, traditional board games are becoming a form of endangered intangible cultural
                     heritage, and in many places what were once widely played games have largely been
                     abandoned. The Digital Ludeme Project applies artificial intelligence and
                     computational techniques to the incompletely documented rules of traditional board
                     games from 3500 BCE until the present to help preserve accurate knowledge of these
                     games. The project engages with the historiography of knowledge about traditional
                     games, determining which parts of the rules are provided by various textual,
                     archaeological, artistic, and ethnographic sources. To document this knowledge and
                     situate it geographically and chronologically, the Ludii Games Database provides the
                     first comprehensive and rigorous Open Access database of scholarship on the global
                     history of board games. Furthermore, the database is used as a source for data for
                     the Ludii general game system, which makes the games playable and provides the
                     analytical tools that will be used in future reconstruction work. Finally, the
                     database may also serve as a reference tool for scholars pursuing research on
                     games-related topics.</p>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly utilized in historical and
                     archaeological research as a method for examining persistent questions within these
                     disciplines. Games are a particular type of cultural heritage that are amenable to
                     AI
                     research, and have received a considerable amount of attention by AI scholars. In
                     contrast, games have not been a particular focus of study in archaeology,
                     anthropology, and history, though the disciplines are centuries older than AI
                     research. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">Despite this, there is a hunger for information on games of the past, and books and
                     websites about games have emerged in the public sphere which cover the topic.
                     However, the material often does not accurately engage with the historical and
                     archaeological record, since much games-related research is very old or not easily
                     accessible. </div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">Though games have been a part of human life for at least the past 5500 years, the
                     disciplines studying human society and its past (anthropology, archaeology, history,
                     among others) have largely ignored games in favor of other areas of human life, such
                     as power relations, economics, and religion. As a result, research on games is
                     hindered by a lack of methodological and theoretical development that have
                     characterized other topics of inquiry. There has been a reliance on certain key works
                     that are outdated in their approaches, and the information they contain has
                     proliferated in the Digital Age, leading to a situation where a large amount of
                     information is readily available online but outdated, not referenced, or unreliable.
                     The appetite for information and historical data on the games of the past is
                     palpable, but historians, archaeologists, and anthropologists have not provided easy
                     access to this information to the public, and so gamers and game enthusiasts have
                     relied on old data and conclusions that are uninformed by theoretical and
                     methodological advances. One salient example is the repeated assertion, from Henry
                     Parker’s Ancient Ceylon [<a class="ref" href="#parker_1909">Parker 1909</a>], that incised patterns on the
                     roof of the Mortuary Temple of Seti I at Qurna are evidence for the presence of games
                     such as Mancala, Nine Men’s Morris, and Alquerque in New Kingdom Egypt and thus
                     dating to the middle of the second millennium BCE, despite the fact that they appear
                     alongside graffiti with Christian iconography [<a class="ref" href="#sch%C3%A4dler_2021">Schädler 2021</a>]!</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">In addition, starting in the twentieth century, the increased global market for
                     proprietary tabletop and video games has changed the ways that people play around
                     the
                     world, and many traditional board games have been lost since then.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">While early research on games largely used hyper-diffusionist paradigms to pinpoint
                     origins and used imaginative reasoning to reconstruct the rules of games (e.g. [<a class="ref" href="#murray_1951">Murray 1951</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#tylor_1879">Tylor 1879</a>]), over the last thirty years
                     research on the games of the past has received considerable more theoretical and
                     methodological rigour (see [<a class="ref" href="#de_voogt_1995">de Voogt 1995</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#finkel_2007">Finkel 2007</a>]) . Moving past these topics, more attention was paid to board morphology,
                     examining games as social processes [<a class="ref" href="#crist_et_al_2016">Crist et al 2016</a>], and using
                     quantitative methods to calculate similarities and classifications of games [<a class="ref" href="#de_voogt_et_al_2013">de Voogt et al. 2013</a>]. Now, with modern computational methods, it is
                     possible to address some of the older research questions within a scientific
                     framework. This was not possible before the advent of the techniques available to
                     modern AI researchers, and provides not only another avenue for examining daily life
                     in the past, but also the possibility to preserve this form of intangible cultural
                     heritage. </div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">All of these challenges and new opportunities present the need for a centralized,
                     well-referenced database that records the known traditional games of human history,
                     placing them within their geographic and chronological context, while clearly stating
                     what rules are known to have been part of them. The Ludii Games Database [<a class="ref" href="#digital_ludeme_project_2022">Digital Ludeme Project 2022</a>] was created to document the knowledge of
                     these traditional games to serve as a resource for anyone interested in games, and
                     to
                     function as a knowledge base for proposing reconstructions of incompletely preserved
                     games using AI. Defining games is, nevertheless, not always straightforward,
                     especially when games are mechanically identical but geographically or
                     chronologically distant. The Ludii Games Database takes a cultural and
                     game-mechanical approach to defining games, which not only helps to highlight the
                     different versions of similar games played by disparate cultures, but which also
                     provides an analytical framework to examine the variability in games through time
                     and
                     space. </div>

                     traditional games is large, the project focuses on board games, which have been the
                     most comprehensively documented form of traditional game for the last 5500 years of
                     human history The Ludii general game playing software [<a class="ref" href="#piette_et_al_2020">Piette et al. 2020</a>], which was

                     as
                     card and domino games as well. As of this writing, the project has documented 1035
                     board games for which enough information has been preserved to contribute to this

                     understand ludemes to be any aspect of a game that is transferable between

                     1970], can be thought of as game memes, even though their usage pre-dates the
                     invention of the meme [Dawkins 1976], as both represent units of cultural information
                     that are transmitted from person to person. And just as memes composed of multiple
                     sub-memes are called memeplexes, we define ludemeplexes as compound structures of
                     ludemes that combine fortuitously to provide a useful higher-level game concept. For
                     example, the following ludemeplex describes the action of adding a piece to an empty
                     site on the board, which is a concept used in many games and so convenient to wrap
                     up

                     adopt and alter the rules of play requires a conceptualization of games based on
                     their means of transmission. The process of cultural transmission has been recently
                     demonstrated as a valuable framework under which processes of change can be examined
                     over large timescales [de Voogt et al. 2013]. The process of cultural transmission
                     of
                     games is dependent on the oral or experiential mechanism by which people learn games.
                     That is to say, that for the vast majority of human existence, games were, and still
                     are, taught and learned by teaching another person the rules, either by explaining
                     them or through playing together. This practice is largely the reason why the rules
                     for most ancient and historical games are lost. They were rarely written down because
                     people learned the games from others, and the vast majority of people who played
                     could not write. Written rules did not become a major force for the cultural
                     transmission of games until the Industrial Era, when games became a focus for
                     commercial activity and were invented or appropriated for profit. Writing down rules
                     creates a defined standard, fixed form of play that is refereed by a corporation,
                     inventor, or governing body, which is drastically different from how games were more
                     traditionally governed, which is by consensus of the players. The traditional form
                     of
                     transmission allows for changes to take hold through time and across cultures,
                     creating different forms which are locally and, often, culturally bound.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p25">Nevertheless, pieces of information that provide details about the rules of play for
                     some of humanity’s traditional games have survived in other media. Game equipment
                     (boards, playing pieces, randomizers) have survived from antiquity, authors have
                     discussed games and used rules of play as metaphors, artists have depicted games in
                     their works, and ethnographers have documented games they observed or were taught,
                     and, in rare occasions, historians and authors with particular interests in games
                     have written treatises on game strategies and documented rules of games. In some
                     cases, such as the ancient Egyptian game Senet, there are hundreds of references to
                     the game and artifacts which survive (see [Piccione 1990]); others, such as
                     Aksadyuta, are only known from one source (in this case, the Mahabharata, an Indian
                     saga [Syed 2020]).</div>

                     rules knowledge for each game to determine what is known and what is absent. Under
                     the Digital Ludeme Project, for the purposes of game reconstruction and for the
                     purposes of software implementation, games are conceived as a collection of ludemes.
                     The artifacts, artistic representations, texts, and ethnographic accounts of game
                     rules provide information about which ludemes were used in any given game. For the
                     purposes of this project, any source which provides a ludeme or which places a game
                     chronologically or geographically is referred to as evidence. The suite of evidence
                     for a particular game provides an honest accounting of what is known about the rules
                     of a particular game, and where and when that knowledge is situated in time and space
                     (Figure 1). This allows for the identification of what knowledge is missing for the
                     game to be playable, as well as allowing for comparison with games in similar times
                     and places, which could suggest ludemes for reconstruction purposes.</div>

                     identified from evidence. The game is known from Roman sources, and was played
                     between the second century BCE until possibly the seventh century CE. Varro (De
                     Lingua Latina 10.22) indicates that the game is played on a quadrangular board; Ovid
                     (Tristia 2.477–478) states that a piece is captured when it is between two of the
                     opponent’s pieces, and pieces move along a straight path and can move backwards. The
                     anonymous author of Laus Pisonis 192–193 states that the pieces are placed on an
                     empty board to begin play, indicating the existence of a placement phase in the game
                     (i.e. there is not a fixed starting position). Actual boards have been found in many
                     parts of the Roman Imperium stretching from the Antonine Wall in Britain to Egypt’s
                     southern border, consisting of a rectangular board with of a grid between six and
                     ten
                     squares per side, the sides sometimes being equal but often, unequal — six-by-seven,
                     six-by-eight, eight-by-eight, and eight-by-nine are some that are attested (see
                     [Crist et al. in press], [Schädler 1994]). The game also appears in art. A terracotta
                     model of a Ludus Latrunculorum game from the Fayyum Oasis of Egypt depicts a
                     six-by-seven board with seventeen pieces placed in the squares of the board [Petrie
                     1927], showing that the pieces were placed in the squares rather than on the corners
                     (as is the case with some games), and that there were at least seventeen pieces in
                     the game, assuming that the uneven number represented shows that some have been
                     captured.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p30">These lines of evidence provide crucial information about board geometry, piece
                     movement and capture, and the starting position of the game, but they are incomplete.
                     The number of pieces is unknown, the manner of placement (one, two, or more at a
                     time) is not stated, the distance of movement (one space at a time or multiple
                     spaces) is ambiguous, and the winning condition is unclear. Identifying these holes
                     then allows for game reconstructions by proposing rules that could fill in those
                     gaps, and testing them with AI playouts. Because of the state of game research, much
                     of what is known about the games of the past is obscured by assumptions,
                     misconceptions, and overly imaginative interpretations that have become repeated as
                     fact, particularly in publicly-accessible resources. Thus, secondary texts are not
                     very reliable when they report on the history and known rules for games. Indeed,
                     sites such as BoardGameGeek and Wikipedia, which contain a great deal of information
                     about games, typically rely on popular works with outdated methodological approaches
                     and data such as A History of Board Games Other than Chess by H.J.R. Murray [1951],
                     or those which do not consistently report the source of their information about
                     games, such as R. C. Bell’s Board and Table Games of Many Civilizations [Bell 1979].
                     For this purpose, a database of the games from humanity’s past, connecting them to
                     the evidence for what their rules are and placing them within their chronological
                     and
                     geographic context, is required to first be able to identify what is known and what
                     needs to be reconstructed. This database will not only function as a data source for
                     the Digital Ludeme Project, but also as an Open Access resource for anyone

                        defining boundaries between discrete games becomes a challenge. Although games are
                        largely defined based on mechanical considerations, i.e., the rules of play; there
                        is some question of when to determine that a game is different enough from another
                        to consider it a separate game. Furthermore, there are many simple games which are
                        identical in their rules, but which are separated in time and/or space to such a
                        degree that cultural transmission seems to be an implausible explanation, and thus
                        should not be considered the same game because they could have been independently
                        invented or the product of convergent evolution. Therefore, the Ludii Games
                        Database takes a hybrid cultural- functional approach to defining games. A game is
                        considered different from another game if it has non-trivial rule differences from
                        another game, or if two games are separated from one another chronologically or
                        geographically in such a way that combining the history of the games as played in

                        identical in their rules [Malaby 2003], and though they are very obviously
                        connected to each other in some way, it does not make sense to connect the history
                        of Backgammon in England with that in Greece, because the history of these places
                        is subject to different cultural interconnections and nearby gaming cultures that
                        could have contributed to changes in game play. Furthermore, Chess in medieval
                        Europe is virtually identical to the game Shatranj as it was played in Southwest
                        Asia at the same time, and undoubtedly Chess was derived from Shatranj itself
                        [Murray 1913]. Though the rules are identical, Chess in Europe had a different
                        history, with different social connotations and divergent future developments into

                        with a game. They are considered differently from games because, for the purposes
                        of game reconstruction, games may have multiple rulesets. For example, the game

                        historical accuracy and playability. Functionality allowing multiple rulesets per
                        game makes this possible. In addition, during the process of game reconstruction,
                        it will be necessary to consider multiple possible rulesets as potential
                        reconstructions. It is likely that some games will have multiple plausible
                        reconstructions, which will be considered as separate rulesets associated with one
                        game, rather than as separate games unto themselves.</div>

                        ludemes. Multiple ludemes can also be combined together into ludemeplexes, which
                        describe certain aspects of a game such as a piece of equipment, or a rule for how
                        a player moves. In a similar manner, each ruleset is made up of many of these
                        ludemeplexes. Due to similar mechanics being present across multiple games, many
                        of our rulesets will share ludemeplexes, and many of these ludemeplexes will share
                        ludemes. As such, the ludemes portion of the database records which ludemplexes
                        are associated with each ruleset, as well as the ludemes which are used in these
                        ludemplexes (and by extension the rulesets as well). Ludemeplexes can also be
                        associated with specific mathematical keywords (e.g. addition, subtraction,
                        rational numbers, etc.) and gameplay-based concepts (e.g. stochastic,

                        reconstruction and cultural heritage preservation relates to the evidence.
                        Evidence consists of primary sources of information that provide information about
                        where, when, how, and by whom a game was played. Evidence is crucial to
                        empirically document which ludemes can be included as part of particular games,
                        which allows for the identification of candidate ludemes to fill in lacunae during
                        the game reconstruction process. It also allows us to identify which cultures
                        played certain games, and to position them in time and space.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p44">Because the game reconstruction process will also trace games geographically and
                        chronologically, each piece of evidence must provide geographical or chronological
                        information, which can be expressed either as a point/date or region/date range.
                        This can be, for example: the date and findspot of an artifact, the date a
                        manuscript was written and the place it was written (or describes), the place
                        where a person observed a game and the dates they were there. This is the minimum
                        amount of information required for a piece of evidence, which will only identify
                        the presence of a game in a particular place and time. Evidence which provides
                        information about game rules, such as board geometry, number of pieces, type of
                        randomizer used, starting position of the pieces, capturing and movement rules,
                        and so forth, are more important for determining the rules for games. Preference
                        is given to collecting this kind of evidence in the database, where it is
                        possible. </div>

                        collected. Because the Digital Ludeme Project is interested in tracking the
                        dispersal of ludemes through person-to-person contact, it must be recognized that
                        games were sometimes restricted to people by social class, age, gender, and other
                        social factors. Documenting these will allow us to account for situations where,
                        for example, a game played by non-elite children in one culture is less likely to
                        be connected to one played by elite adults in a neighboring culture than another
                        game that was also played by elites or adults. </div>

                     inform the user about the game. References are linked either to the original
                     document, when they are available in an Open Access digital format, or to their
                     WorldCat entry. Information such as period and region are calculated from the

                     itself, a particular state that occurs during gameplay, or a move played. They can
                     be

                     of game research, while also handling the complexity of defining boundaries between
                     games. The relationships between entities in the database allow us to easily tie
                     games, rulesets, and evidence to one another, but also provide flexibility in
                     situations where we decide that ancient or historical evidence should actually be
                     associated with separate games or rulesets, rather than one. For example, boards from
                     the Roman Empire were originally connected to the English game Nine Men’s Morris
                     because they shared the same board, but it was later decided that the Roman material
                     should be considered separately, and the existing evidence tied to the newly entered
                     game "Roman Merels" instead. Such flexibility allows for easy changes that will occur
                     as analysis of different games progresses, as the project anticipates identifying
                     connections between different games that may indicate that two separate games should
                     be considered the same, or that one should be separated into two different ones. </div>

                     of the knowledge that is preserved about ancient games. By tying the specific pieces
                     of evidence to relevant games and reporting the specific rules which that evidence
                     provides, the database is intended to serve as an authoritative reference guide for
                     board games. Others which exist online, such as BoardGameGeek
                     (https://boardgamegeek.com), also provide wide-ranging information about the games
                     of
                     the world, but it is not academic in nature, often not providing references for the
                     information contained therein, thus rendering their data impossible to verify.
                     Others, such as Mancala World (https://mancala.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page), can be
                     well-referenced but focus specifically on a certain type of game. The Ludii Games
                     Database has the benefit of being a comprehensive database of games from around the
                     world with referenced data that is also geographically and chronologically situated.
                     Future work can also include card and domino games in a similar format, as the
                     database and Ludii software is compatible with these game types as well. </div>
