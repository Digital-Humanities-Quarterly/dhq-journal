                  <p>As commercial tabletop and video games become increasingly popular throughout the
                     world, traditional board games are becoming a form of endangered intangible cultural
                     heritage, and in many places what were once widely played games have largely been
                     abandoned. The Digital Ludeme Project applies artificial intelligence and
                     computational techniques to the incompletely documented rules of traditional board
                     games from 3500 BCE until the present to help preserve accurate knowledge of these
                     games. The project engages with the historiography of knowledge about traditional
                     games, determining which parts of the rules are provided by various textual,
                     archaeological, artistic, and ethnographic sources. To document this knowledge and
                     situate it geographically and chronologically, the Ludii Games Database provides the
                     first comprehensive and rigorous Open Access database of scholarship on the global
                     history of board games. Furthermore, the database is used as a source for data for
                     the Ludii general game system, which makes the games playable and provides the
                     analytical tools that will be used in future reconstruction work. Finally, the
                     database may also serve as a reference tool for scholars pursuing research on
                     games-related topics.</p>

                        study in archaeology, anthropology, and history. Despite this, there is a hunger
                        for information on games of the past, and books and websites about games have
                        emerged in the public sphere which cover the topic. Even where this information is
                        available, such research often does not accurately engage with the historical and
                        archaeological record, since much games-related research is very old or not easily
                        accessible. Furthermore, the recent explosion of game studies as a discipline of
                        research in its own right, as well as the thirst for games knowledge among gaming
                        communities and the interested public, demonstrate that there is an audience for
                        research on games. Because of this, we developed the Ludii Games Database to
                        document the preserved knowledge of board games. The database functions as the
                        basis for the Ludii general game system, which uses a human-readable programming
                        language to digitally model these games to make them playable. Importantly, this
                        software facilitates research on games using AI-driven playout simulation. This
                        paper discusses the need for a database of games and situates its construction
                        around the task of modeling games digitally, while explaining how the Ludii games
                        database solves many of these issues and provides a reliable knowledge base to
                        seed future research on games in cultural and computational fields. </div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p2">Such a task is not without challenges considering the history of games research.
                        Though games have been a part of human life for at least the past 5500 years, the
                        disciplines studying human society and its past (anthropology, archaeology,
                        history, among others) have largely ignored games in favor of other areas of human
                        life, such as power relations, economics, and religion. As a result, research on
                        games is hindered by a lack of methodological and theoretical development that
                        have characterized other topics of inquiry. There has been a reliance on certain
                        key works (e.g., [<a class="ref" href="#murray_1951">Murray 1951</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#bell_1979">Bell 1979</a>]) that
                        are outdated in their approaches, and the information they contain has
                        proliferated in the Digital Age, leading to a situation where a large amount of
                        information is readily available online but outdated, not referenced, or
                        unreliable. The appetite for information and historical data on the games of the
                        past is palpable, but historians, archaeologists, and anthropologists have not
                        provided easy access to this information to the public, and so gamers and game
                        enthusiasts have relied on old data and conclusions that are uninformed by
                        theoretical and methodological advances. One salient example is the repeated
                        assertion, from Henry Parker’s <span class="hi italic">Ancient Ceylon</span>
                        [<a class="ref" href="#parker_1909">Parker 1909</a>], that incised patterns on the roof of the Mortuary
                        Temple of Seti I at Qurna are evidence for the presence of games such as Mancala,
                        Nine Men’s Morris, and Alquerque in New Kingdom Egypt and thus dating to the
                        middle of the second millennium BCE, despite the fact that they appear alongside
                        graffiti with Christian iconography [<a class="ref" href="#schadler_2021">Schädler 2021</a>]!</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p3">In addition, starting in the twentieth century, the increased global market for
                        proprietary tabletop and video games has changed the ways that people play around
                        the world, and many traditional games have been lost since then [<a class="ref" href="#komariah_salim_2019">Komariah and Salim 2019</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#fabian_2023">Fabian 2023</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#appadurai_1995">Appadurai 1995</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#mukherjee_in_press">Mukherjee in press</a>].</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p4">While early research on games largely used hyper-diffusionist paradigms to
                        pinpoint origins and used imaginative reasoning to reconstruct the rules of games
                        (e.g. [<a class="ref" href="#murray_1951">Murray 1951</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#tylor_1879">Tylor 1879</a>]), over the last
                        thirty years research on the games of the past has received considerable more
                        theoretical and methodological rigour (see [<a class="ref" href="#de_voogt_1995">de Voogt 1995</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#mackenzie_finkel_2004">Mackenzie and Finkel 2004</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#finkel_2007">Finkel 2007</a>]). Moving past
                        these topics, more attention was paid to board morphology, examining games as
                        social processes [<a class="ref" href="#crist_et_al_2016a">Crist et al. 2016a</a>], and using quantitative

                        possible to address some of the older research questions within a scientific
                        framework. This was not possible before the advent of the techniques available to
                        modern AI researchers, and provides not only another avenue for examining daily
                        life in the past, but also the possibility to preserve this form of intangible
                        cultural heritage [<a class="ref" href="#crist_soemers_2023">Crist and Soemers 2023</a>].</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p5">All of these challenges and new opportunities present the need for a centralized,
                        well-referenced database that records the known traditional games of human
                        history, placing them within their geographic and chronological context, while
                        clearly stating what rules are known to have been part of them. The Ludii Games
                        Database [<a class="ref" href="#dlp_2022">Digital Ludeme Project 2022</a>] was created to document the knowledge of these
                        traditional games, to serve as a resource for anyone interested in games, and to
                        function as a knowledge base for proposing reconstructions of incompletely
                        preserved games using AI. Defining games is, nevertheless, not always
                        straightforward, especially when games are mechanically identical but
                        geographically or chronologically distant. The Ludii Games Database takes a
                        cultural and game-mechanical approach to defining games, which not only helps to
                        highlight the different versions of similar games played by disparate cultures,
                        but which also provides an analytical framework to examine the variability in

                        change in play [<a class="ref" href="#browne_2022">Browne 2022 </a>]. This can include not only the rules

                        inherent geometry has a fundamental impact on the game. The following example

                        adopt and alter the rules of play requires a conceptualization of games based on
                        their means of transmission. The process of cultural transmission has been
                        recently demonstrated as a valuable framework under which processes of change can
                        be examined over large timescales [<a class="ref" href="#de_voogt_et_al_2013">de Voogt et al. 2013</a>]. The
                        process of cultural transmission of games is dependent on the oral or experiential
                        mechanism by which people learn games. That is to say, that for the vast majority
                        of human existence, games were, and still are, taught and learned by teaching
                        another person the rules, either by explaining them or through playing together.
                        This practice is largely the reason why the rules for most ancient and historical
                        games are lost. They were rarely written down because people learned the games
                        from others, and the vast majority of people who played could not write. Written
                        rules did not become a major force for the cultural transmission of games until
                        the Industrial Era, when games became a focus for commercial activity and were
                        invented or appropriated for profit. Writing down rules creates a defined
                        standard, fixed form of play that is refereed by a corporation, inventor, or
                        governing body, which is drastically different from how games were more
                        traditionally governed, which is by consensus of the players. The traditional form
                        of transmission allows for changes to take hold through time and across cultures,
                        creating different forms which are locally and, often, culturally bound.</div>

                        authors have discussed games and used rules of play as metaphors, artists have

                        of game rules provide information about which ludemes were used in any given game.
                        For the purposes of this project, any source which provides a ludeme or which

                        identified from evidence. The game is known from Roman sources, and was played
                        between the second century BCE until possibly the seventh century CE. Varro (<span class="hi italic">De Lingua Latina</span> 10.22) indicates that the game is played on
                        a quadrangular board; Ovid (<span class="hi italic">Tristia</span> 2.477–478) states that
                        a piece is captured when it is between two of the opponent’s pieces, and pieces
                        move along a straight path and can move backwards. The anonymous author of <span class="hi italic">Laus Pisonis</span> 192–193 states that the pieces are placed on an
                        empty board to begin play, indicating the existence of a placement phase in the
                        game (i.e. there is not a fixed starting position). Actual boards have been found
                        in many parts of the Roman Imperium stretching from the Antonine Wall in Britain
                        to Egypt’s southern border, consisting of a rectangular board with of a grid
                        between six and ten squares per side, the sides sometimes being equal but often,
                        unequal — six-by-seven, six-by-eight, eight-by-eight, and eight-by-nine are some
                        that are attested (see [<a class="ref" href="#crist_et_al_2024">Crist et al. 2024</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#schadler_1994">Schädler 1994</a>]). The game also appears in art. A terracotta model of
                        a Ludus Latrunculorum game from the Fayyum Oasis of Egypt depicts a six-by-seven
                        board with seventeen pieces placed in the squares of the board [<a class="ref" href="#petrie_1927">Petrie 1927</a>], showing that the pieces were placed in the squares
                        rather than on the corners (as is the case with some games), and that there were
                        at least seventeen pieces in the game, assuming that the uneven number represented
                        shows that some have been captured.</div>

                        defining boundaries between discrete games becomes a challenge. Although games are
                        largely defined based on mechanical considerations, i.e., the rules of play; there
                        is some question of when to determine that a game is different enough from another
                        to consider it a separate game. Furthermore, there are many simple games which are
                        identical in their rules, but which are separated in time and/or space to such a
                        degree that cultural transmission seems to be an implausible explanation, and thus
                        should not be considered the same game because they could have been independently
                        invented or the product of convergent evolution. Therefore, the Ludii Games
                        Database takes a hybrid cultural-functional approach to defining games. A game is
                        considered different from another game if it has non-trivial rule differences from
                        another game, or if two games are separated from one another chronologically or
                        geographically in such a way that combining the history of the games as played in

                     <div class="ptext" id="p20">For example, the English game Backgammon and the Greek game Portes are nearly
                        identical in their rules [<a class="ref" href="#malaby_2003">Malaby 2003</a>], and though they are very
                        obviously connected to each other in some way, it does not make sense to connect
                        the history of Backgammon in England with that in Greece, because the history of
                        these places is subject to different cultural interconnections and nearby gaming
                        cultures that could have contributed to changes in game play. Furthermore, Chess
                        in medieval Europe is virtually identical to the game Shatranj as it was played in
                        Southwest Asia at the same time, and undoubtedly Chess was derived from Shatranj
                        itself [<a class="ref" href="#murray_1913">Murray 1913</a>]. Though the rules are identical, Chess in
                        Europe had a different history, with different social connotations and divergent
                        future developments into the modern game, so these games are catalogued separately

                        games. Rulesets, however, function as medium-level descriptions of how the games
                        were played. Rulesets describe the specific equipment and rules of play associated
                        with a game. They are considered differently from games because, for the purposes
                        of game reconstruction, games may have multiple rulesets. For example, the game
                        Alquerque, known from medieval Spain, was described differently by two different
                        authors, Alfonso X [<a class="ref" href="#golladay_nd">Golladay n.d.</a>] and Covarrubias [1674]. The rules
                        are compatible with each other, but Covarrubias describes capturing in greater
                        detail than Alfonso X. Because it cannot be assumed that these capturing details
                        were played in Alfonso’s time, these rulesets are considered distinct for the
                        purpose of analysing the game.</div>

                        historical accuracy and playability. Functionality allowing multiple rulesets per
                        game makes this possible. In addition, during the process of game reconstruction,
                        it will be necessary to consider multiple possible rulesets as potential
                        reconstructions. It is likely that some games will have multiple plausible
                        reconstructions, which will be considered as separate rulesets associated with one

                        ludemes. Multiple ludemes can also be combined together into ludemeplexes, which
                        describe certain aspects of a game such as a piece of equipment, or a rule for how
                        a player moves. In a similar manner, each ruleset is made up of many of these
                        ludemeplexes. Due to similar mechanics being present across multiple games, many
                        of our rulesets will share ludemeplexes, and many of these ludemeplexes will share
                        ludemes. As such, the ludemes portion of the database records which ludemplexes
                        are associated with each ruleset, as well as the ludemes which are used in these
                        ludemplexes (and by extension the rulesets as well). Ludemeplexes can also be
                        associated with specific mathematical keywords (e.g. addition, subtraction,
                        rational numbers, etc.) and gameplay-based concepts (e.g. stochastic,

                        Evidence consists of primary sources of information that provide information about
                        where, when, how, and by whom a game was played. Evidence is crucial to
                        empirically document which ludemes can be included as part of particular games,
                        which allows for the identification of candidate ludemes to fill in lacunae during
                        the game reconstruction process. It also allows us to identify which cultures
                        played certain games, and to position them in time and space.</div>

                        chronologically, each piece of evidence must provide geographical or chronological
                        information, which can be expressed either as a point/date or region/date range.
                        This can be, for example: the date and findspot of an artifact, the date a
                        manuscript was written and the place it was written (or describes), the place
                        where a person observed a game and the dates they were there. This is the minimum
                        amount of information required for a piece of evidence, which will only identify
                        the presence of a game in a particular place and time. Evidence which provides
                        information about game rules, such as board geometry, number of pieces, type of
                        randomizer used, starting position of the pieces, capturing and movement rules,
                        and so forth, are more important for determining the rules for games. Preference
                        is given to collecting this kind of evidence in the database, where it is
                        possible. </div>

                        collected. Because the Digital Ludeme Project is interested in tracking the
                        dispersal of ludemes through person-to-person contact, it must be recognized that
                        games were sometimes restricted to people by social class, age, gender, and other
                        social factors. Documenting these will allow us to account for situations where,
                        for example, a game played by non-elite children in one culture is less likely to
                        be connected to one played by elite adults in a neighboring culture than another
                        game that was also played by elites or adults. </div>

                           these based on their cultural, geographical, and conceptual proximity [<a class="ref" href="#stephenson_et_al_2023">Stephenson et al. 2023 </a>] to the original game rules. This process
                           enables Ludii to generate comprehensive rulesets, which are then filtered to
                           align with established board game concepts and the evidence gathered for these
                           games.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p46">Because the Ludii Games Database was built specifically to support Ludii in achieving
                     the Digital Ludeme Project’s AI-based game reconstruction research, there have been
                     challenges in translating game-related evidence from historical and archaeological
                     data in ways that provide meaningful representations of what is known about a
                     particular game. For example, as described above, we considered games where evidence
                     documents identical complete rules in different cultures to be different games. This
                     model is difficult to apply in the deep past, where evidence is both sparse and
                     incomplete for games. One example is for the Egyptian game Senet, which was played
                     for roughly three thousand years in Egypt, Nubia, West Asia, and Cyprus, at various
                     points in time [<a class="ref" href="#crist_et_al_2016b">Crist et al. 2016b</a>]. For ancient games like this, we
                     decided to use a different model where a given piece of evidence may provide only
                     a
                     portion of the rules. For example, a limited selection of evidence for Senet
                     indicates the track along which the pieces move through the sequence of squares on
                     the board. We want this evidence to be considered as part of the game everywhere it
                     was found. Where there is evidence to suggest there may be variations in the way this
                     game was played, such as boards that are marked with distinct patterns in the playing
                     squares to presumably indicate certain gameplay events, these were separated into
                     different rulesets for Senet, so they can be considered separately from one another,
                     but still as part of the set of evidence that more broadly defines what we know about
                     this game.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p47">The structure of the Ludii Games Database allows for flexibility in different kinds
                     of game research, while also handling the complexity of defining boundaries between
                     games. The relationships between entities in the database allow us to easily tie
                     games, rulesets, and evidence to one another, but also provide flexibility in
                     situations where we decide that ancient or historical evidence should actually be
                     associated with separate games or rulesets, rather than one. For example, boards from
                     the Roman Empire were originally connected to the English game Nine Men’s Morris
                     because they shared the same board, but it was later decided that the Roman material
                     should be considered separately, and the existing evidence tied to the newly entered
                     game “Roman Merels” instead. Such flexibility allows for easy changes that will
                     occur as analysis of different games progresses, as the project anticipates
                     identifying connections between different games that may indicate that two separate
                     games should be considered the same, or that one should be separated into two
                     different ones. This demonstrates the flexibility of the database, as entries can
                     be
                     changed as new evidence for games emerges, so games can be redefined and evidence
                     reassigned.</div>

                     are many boards, objects, and brief accounts that may indicate the existence of board
                     games that are not easily defined into ludemes. For example, there are many finds
                     throughout the ancient world of singular or small groups of dice or playing pieces,
                     which cannot be defined as belonging to a particular game or as a meaningful ludeme.
                     Because the Ludii Games Database is built to use evidence to define the ludemes that
                     belong to a game, the documentation of these kinds of objects does not add knowledge
                     about particular games. Nevertheless, game-related material in a particular place
                     and
                     time still points to the presence of a game there. Such is the case, for example,
                     of
                     a recently-discovered group of pieces from Başur Höyük, Turkey [<a class="ref" href="#saglamtimur_2017">Sağlamtimur 2017</a>], which probably consist of several groups of pieces

                     considerable amount of documentation needs to be done to achieve the same level of
                     resolution of games knowledge across the globe. Particular regions of the world are
                     strongly represented in our database either because they are well-published in
                     Western European languages, (such as India and Sri Lanka) or because a particular
                     researcher took an interest in the games of a particular place and comprehensively
                     documented them (such as in Mongolia [<a class="ref" href="#kabzinska-stawarz_1991">Kabzińska-Stawarz 1991</a>] and the
                     Horn of Africa [<a class="ref" href="#pankhurst_1971">Pankhurst 1971</a>]). Eastern Europe, as well as East and
                     Southeast Asia, are areas which could particularly benefit from the collection of
                     further data, as the information from games in these areas is either primarily
                     published in local languages or not documented. South America is also a place which
                     historically has received little attention from games research, and recent work in
                     Argentina suggests there is a considerable amount of evidence for indigenous board

                     provides a powerful tool for AI-based research on games. In computer science, games
                     have been a particular focus of research, as games provide simple, discrete,
                     rule-based systems that can lead to the development of AI techniques [<a class="ref" href="#crist_soemers_2023">Crist and Soemers 2023</a>]. However, because of the lack of cultural data on
                     traditional games, AI research that attempts to use such games must rely on outdated,

                     researchers to study games by allowing AI agents to play games and generate
                     quantitative data that can help to answer research questions, but which would be
                     prohibitively time consuming to generate through human play. For example, we
                     conducted AI experiments to explore the archeological evidence for the Roman game
                     Ludus Latrunculorum, mentioned above. Using the concepts search menu, we manually
                     identified games (Kharebga [<a class="ref" href="#bellin_1964">Bellin 1964</a>] and Seega [<a class="ref" href="#davies_1925">Davies 1925</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#lane_1836">Lane 1836</a>]) that contained all of the
                     rules known to have been used in this game, and simulated play to determine their
                     playability on the wide range of sizes of rectangular or square boards found at
                     Roman-era sites. This research determined that boards smaller than ten-by-ten squares
                     are more likely to have been used for this game, and larger ones were probably
                     another game not discussed in the Roman sources, probably one played by the
                     indigenous population of Europe outside of Italy, since these boards were found
                     largely away from the urban centres of the empire [<a class="ref" href="#crist_et_al_2024">Crist et al. 2024</a>]. </div>

                     information on game rules is missing. Ludii then procedurally identifies potential
                     playable rule sets that might fit these gaps [<a class="ref" href="#crist_et_al_in_press">Crist et al in press</a>].
                     Calculations based on game distance — i.e., the vector distance between two or more
                     games using the shared concepts (rules, mechanics, design and strategies) they
                     contain [<a class="ref" href="#stephenson_et_al_2023">Stephenson et al. 2023 </a>] — can be coupled with other distance
                     measurements meant to model social change across time and space. This methodology
                     allows Ludii to match a game with closely related ones, using their rules as a basis
                     to propose new, quantitatively plausible rule reconstructions for historical games.
                     Work on this process is ongoing. We are also exploring the application of
                     AI-simulated play to attempt to identify play that replicates use-wear on
                     archaeological game boards, another method that could potentially aid in the

                     to play a particular game could inform research on time as experienced during play.

                     developed as a discipline largely focused on video games and driven by the commercial
                     success and cultural prevalence of that industry [<a class="ref" href="#mayra_2008">Mäyrä 2008</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#nieborg_hermes_2008">Nieborg and Hermes 2008</a>]. Despite the more than five thousand years of

                     when compared to video games which can be experienced as part of contemporary

                     of the games and cultures of play that surround them, so facilitating connection to
                     the sources that discuss the games in a given time and place is crucial to improving
                     future research. Research questions that have been discussed in particular cultural
                     contexts can then be explored in other cultures or even on a worldwide basis. For

                     resource for studying how traditional games change through time — an important
                     process of cultural transmission that can help us to model how ideas travel and
                     change that is not dependent on exchange of goods or materials [<a class="ref" href="#de_voogt_et_al_2013">de Voogt et al. 2013</a>]. Many of the games in the database were documented
                     in the nineteenth and early twentieth century, but few people have reviewed whether
                     these games are still played today. Are the rules different now? Do they vary from
                     community to community? The evidence in the database can serve as a starting point
                     from which scholars can gather new data on traditional games and then compare this
                     data to what was gathered in another time and place to explore change through time,
                     to examine cross-cultural contact or how cultural practices change within a
                     particular society. Modeling how games changed through time and how different social
                     processes affect rule changes could go a long way to creating models of cultural
                     change more broadly. These applications discussed here are not comprehensive, but
                     the
                     opportunities presented by having accessible data are great.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p56">The scope and content of the Ludii games database will continue to expand through
                     the
                     help of the COST Action GameTable: Computational Techniques for Tabletop Games
                     Heritage. This initiative brings together scholars with research backgrounds spanning
                     AI, cultural disciplines, mathematics and education to develop new ways to explore
                     the ways these fields intersect to study intangible tabletop games heritage [<a class="ref" href="#piette_et_al_2024">Piette et al. 2024</a>]. One of the main ways that this will expand the
                     database will be to include traditional card and domino games in a similar format,
                     as
                     these are crucial forms of tabletop games that are not yet represented and are
                     supported by the Ludii playing software [<a class="ref" href="#morenville_piette_2024">Morenville and Piette 2024</a>]. We
                     will also explore ways to mitigate the challenges indicated above, as well as to
                     incorporate more visual material. GameTable will also explore developing more
                     human-like AI algorithms, which will allow for AI-simulated play that more closely
                     imitates human behaviour rather than optimal play, thus providing scholars with a
                     better research tool for games research. It will also explore explainable search
                     techniques for playing agents and reinforcement learning approaches to discover
                     interpretable strategies for playing these games [<a class="ref" href="#soemers_et_al_2024">Soemers et al. 2024</a>].</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p57">Though the Ludii Games Database serves as a depository for information about
                     traditional games from around the world and is fundamentally designed to provide data
                     to be used by other researchers. Even more importantly, it is accessible to the
                     general public and non-specialists who are interested in traditional and historical
                     games from all around the world, presenting data on games honestly and transparently.
                     But most crucially, it provides a place online where information on traditional,
                     historical, and ancient games, many of which are no longer maintained by traditional
                     player communities, can be preserved and new communities could form around them,
                     since they are playable in Ludii. Through partnerships with museums and cultural
                     organizations, we are exploring strategies for further developing methods of
                     preservation of gaming heritage. There is also a considerable opportunity for the
                     use
                     of the database as a pedagogical resource, not only to teach about game studies, but
                     also in many relevant disciplines that could highlight games as cultural practices
                     of
                     historical importance. This comprehensive resource therefore contributes to the
                     validation of game studies as useful to people studying other kinds of cultural
                     phenomena, and provides a new strategy for the preservation of the threatened
                     intangible cultural heritage of traditional games. </div>
