                  <p>Trisha Campbell is a 4th year doctoral student at the University of Pittsburgh
                     in the English Department, where she teaches, researches, and practices new
                     materialist poetics and composing as method. Before her work at the University
                     of Pittsburgh, she acquired an MA in Rhetoric and Composition from Auburn
                     University, focusing on the future of invention in multimodal composing. She is
                     wholly dedicated to the work of creative-critical method(s) and future(s),
                     reading poetry just as often as philosophy, and making or composing from and
                     about digital, analog, and otherwise material objects. She is currently
                     developing the foundation for a new materialist method for Rhetoric and
                     Composition, which takes up local murder in Pittsburgh as its source in hopes
                     of raising questions of narrative, knowledge-making, ontological entanglements,
                     ethics and futurity. She can be found via email (tnc17@pitt.edu) or online

            <title rend="italic">The Computer Boys Take Over: Computers, Programmers, and the
               Politics of Technical Expertise</title> by Nathan Ensmenger</head>
         <p>Last summer, I sat for a Rails Girls Workshop. The room was small, the chairs
            multi-colored assortments ramming against rows of Macbooks. We all got T-shirts with
            digital hearts on them. Looking around the room, I noted more colors of hair than colors
            of chairs, from purple to pink, to none at all. These women, I thought, are the future
            of the computer programmer. But this kind of programmer, the funky girl programmer, is a
            relatively new innovation, stemming from a fraught history of the “computer boy,” as
            Nathan Ensmenger puts it in his part computational, part sociological study of the
            invention of the <soCalled>computer boys,</soCalled> or today’s <soCalled>IT
               guys.</soCalled> Ensmenger’s work explores how the social and technological
            developments of the twentieth century were made to happen through people, not impersonal
            processes, to socially re-construct the <soCalled>computer revolution</soCalled> as
            proffered via the computer boys. He offers a fresh history of the emergence of
               <soCalled>computer specialists</soCalled> as they began and sought to make an
            identity of their specialty through professionalization and organization into an agreed
            upon study. He does this by capturing the tension between what began as the craft of
            computer programming, then thought to be an art, and the growing
               <soCalled>scientization</soCalled> of programming in the 1970s. Tensions emerged
            between the craft-centered practices of vocational programmers (i.e. programming is
            poetry), the increasingly theoretical agenda of academic computer science, and the
            desire of corporate managers to control and routinize (i.e. what we know today as
            computer science) the process of software development. Eventually, amidst the tensions,
            a decision was made in the late 1960s to make the field more masculine. </p>
         <figure>
            <graphic url="resources/images/figure01.png"/>
         </figure>
         <p>Ensmenger’s work moves the focus off the technology and technological determinism of
            software studies, away from what has been falsely labeled the <q>computer
               revolution,</q> which implies a deterministic phenomenon brought about by the
            computer. Instead, he puts the emphasis on the people — <q>the computer boys</q> —
            building the software and the rhetoric surrounding job demands, aptitude tests, and
            images of the programmer. His text enters into a line of historical work on technology
            attempting to re-make a history that includes people (those seen and unseen), politics,
            economics, social elements and rhetoric. </p>
         <figure>
            <graphic url="resources/images/figure02.png"/>
         </figure>
         <p>As Ensmenger works through the <q>fault lines</q> in software development, he reveals
            how the <quote rend="inline" source="#ensmenger2010">points of tension between groups or
               individuals, differing perceptions of reality or visions for the future, and subtle
               hierarchies and structures of power relationships</quote> come out most notably in
            the disappearance of women from what is now the field of computer science/programming
               <ptr target="#ensmenger2010" loc="11"/>. This fault line in the history is a crucial
            underlying crack in the book and is implied, I think purposefully, by the moniker <q>the
               computer boys.</q>
         </p>
         <p>Ultimately, Ensmenger wants his readers not only to understand that software is socially
            constructed but also to imagine that the software crises pervading the industry now, if
            seen through the lens of social construction, can help explain why <cit>
               <quote rend="inline" source="#ensmenger2010">in an industry characterized by rapid
                  change and innovation, the rhetoric of crisis has proven so remarkably
                  persistent</quote>
               <ptr target="#ensmenger2010" loc="243"/>
            </cit>. Along with this, he proposes three solutions to the software crisis brandished
            upon his history and relies on an argument for heterogeneity. This heterogeneity,
            though, is only complicated by what it means to invent again: <cit>
               <quote rend="inline" source="#ensmenger2010">design in a heterogeneous environment is
                  difficult… The hardest single part of building a software system is deciding
                  precisely what to build</quote>
               <ptr target="#ensmenger2010" loc="241"/>
            </cit>. </p>
         <p>And therein lies my only problem with the book, and it is my same problem with many
            academic books; the thing is socially constructed and the pages of the text helped us
            get there, but <emph>how </emph>do we build from this heterogeneity. Is there a method?
            Perhaps this will be Ensmenger’s second book. Either way, I greatly enjoyed Ensmenger’s
            charming telling of <title rend="italic">Cosmopolitan</title>s aptitude surveys for
            women or the silly job ads from RCA. He does an interesting history of software, of the
            computer boys, of the missing computer girls (as <title rend="italic">Cosmo</title>
            dubbed them), and he prepares the way for those of us in the fit of this software crisis
            to re-think what we build, at the very level of invention. </p>
         <p>The book opens with Chapter 1, <title rend="quotes">Introduction: Computer
               Revolutionaries,</title> in which Ensmenger presents a term he does a lot with, both
            in the book and on his website (<ref target="http://thecomputerboys.com/"
               >http://thecomputerboys.com/</ref>): <emph>the computer people</emph>. Computer
            people, for Ensmenger, are those people neglected by history and discourse in the
            chatter about the computer. This is in part, he says, the <q>conventions of the
               genre,</q> but it has to do with the traditional bias of the computer and the history
            of the <emph>computer, </emph>rather than the history of the computer people. Ensmenger
            uses the figure of <q>computer people</q> to trace a history of software through the
            computer boys as they sought to make a role for themselves and to get at the invention
            of the computer user: <cit>
               <quote rend="inline" source="#ensmenger2010">Historians have long suggested that
                  technological innovators, including the designers of electronic computers, also
                  invent the kind of people they expect to use their innovations</quote>
               <ptr target="#ensmenger2010" loc="13"/>
            </cit>. </p>
         <p>In Chapter 2, <title rend="quotes">The Black Art of Programming,</title> Ensmenger
            continues his peopled computer history with the story of how programming became magical
            black art. He maps the origin of computer programming from the 1950s through the 1960s,
            particularly 1968, when it was decided at a NATO Conference on Software Engineering that
            programming had come to be perceived as <q>too artistic.</q> This was an attempt to
            steer programming into something more scientific and masculine. This chapter is full of
            interesting old ads from RCA and stories of agents flowing in and out of how we perceive
            of programming today. </p>
         <p>Chapter 3, <title rend="quotes">Chess Players, Music Lovers, and Mathematicians</title>
            and Chapter 4, <title rend="quotes">Tower of Babel,</title> discuss the aptitude testing
            rampant in the beginning of the computer revolution. The search for qualified people and
               <q>clever fellows</q> began with certain quirky criteria set out for what might make
            a good programmer. Programming at this time was thought to be an innate quality, where
            details, task-orientation, and anti-social tendencies seemed to equal a good programmer.
            Gender again shows up, because even while <title rend="italic">Cosmopolitan</title> put
            out aptitude tests for their female readers, the questions were slanted toward an
            antisocial, mathematically inclined male. </p>
         <p>From this masculinization of a profession and group of people came the disciplinization
            of modern computing, where computer programming became a computer <emph>science.
            </emph>Ensmenger explores the rise and <q>scientization</q> of the field in Chapter 5,
               <title rend="quotes">The Rise of Computer Science,</title> through the messy
            compromises involving what computing should or ought to look like. </p>
         <p>In Chapter 6, <title rend="quotes">The Cosa Nostra of the Data Processing
               Industry</title> we meet Herbert Grosch, who called programmers the <q>Cosa
               Nostra</q> of the computer industry: <cit>
               <quote rend="inline" source="#ensmenger2010">[programmers] are at once the most
                  unmanageable and the most poorly managed specialisms in our society. Actors and
                  artists pale by comparison. Only our mathematicians are as cantankerous, and it’s
                  a calamity that so many of them get recruited by simplistic personnel men</quote>
               <ptr target="#ensmenger2010" loc="137"/>
            </cit>. This chapter marks the break between managers and programmers and gives way to
            the invisible computer technician. </p>
         <p>Bit by bit and history by history, Ensmenger has re-composed the computer technician
            back into a body and personality. A body and personality, which he suggests, can be
            otherwise. In his final chapter, <title rend="quotes">Conclusion: Visible
               Technician,</title> he offers what to do with all the people — boys, to be exact —
            that created our current digital world and software situation. He asks where all the
               <q>computer girls</q> went, never quite settling on an answer to this question. He
            blames professionalization and the construction of a gender identity tied to the
            construction of the programmer identity. Yet the question of women still looms and seems
            to serve as a backdrop for many of his questions; it is the invention of the <q>computer
               user</q> as made by the invention of the computer technician, that Ensmeger gives us,
            which has become a one-to-one loop that leaves the invention of the woman out of the
            process. This is a wonderfully complex position to begin thinking about where all the
            women have gone. That said, he does give three crucial lessons to be learned in his
            history as it relates to software, which I will only adumbrate to wet your palate:
            design is heterogeneous and software is always about more than code, more than
            technology, and more than the professional and managerial dictions; it does at its very
            most and its very least affect human beings amidst a network of other agents. </p>
         <p>Nathan Ensmenger’s book is an impressive and engrossing historical work. He brings the
            crises and the peopling of computer programming alive. His historical artifacts become
            characters and a full picture of what this heterogeneous history looks like emerges. He
            adeptly weaves together competing voices in history with competing personalities to
            leave us with this haunting and antagonizing last line, echoed from the rhetoric of
            programming as created by the history: <cit>
               <quote rend="inline" source="#ensmenger2010">almost thirty years after the NATO
                  Conference on Software Engineering many programmers are still concluding that
                     <q>excellent developers, like excellent musicians and artists, are born, not
                     made</q>
               </quote>
               <ptr target="#ensmenger2010" loc="243"/>
            </cit>. Let us finally see that they have been made and can be re-made, like the hair of
            the Rails Girls, in various shades.</p>
