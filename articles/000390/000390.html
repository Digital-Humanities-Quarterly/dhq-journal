                  <p>The advent of handheld digital devices has proved to be revolutionary for the
                     teaching of art history. They make it possible to supplement, even replace, the
                     traditional format of lecturing and communal viewing of a single screen. On their
                     personal screens, students can enter a searchable world of thousands of virtual
                     images: what the radical art theorist and novelist André Malraux, more than half a
                     century ago, called “the imaginary museum.” For several years, I
                     have been experimenting with my art history classes, showing my students how to use
                     their laptops, tablets and phones to become active viewers and collaborators.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Multiple virtual images transform the content, as well as the environment, of
                     learning art history. Rather than being restricted to the illustrations in a
                     textbook, students can use their devices to engage with online image sources such
                     as
                     museum websites, image databanks, and auction houses. Portable digital technology
                     can
                     turn the art history classroom into a collaborative and dynamic experience
                     inconceivable a short time ago. Malraux himself, who believed in the power of art
                     to
                     transcend time and space, might be amazed at what is now not only possible, but
                     commonplace.

                  “A metaphor of the times,” was a common
                  lament, as almost a thousand people copied and shared the image within a day. The
                  photographer, Gijsbert van der Wal, later commented, “It went viral, with people often adding rather dispirited
                  captions: today’s youth is more interested in Whatsapp than they are in
                  Rembrandt.”

                  assignment on the painting [<a class="ref" href="#molloy2016">Molloy 2016</a>]. It is generally assumed that the
                  act of looking down at a phone instead of one’s surroundings shows inattention, a
                  surrender to distraction, a hopeless nullification of social and intellectual
                  engagement. But in fact, using a smartphone tablet, or laptop can be a way of connecting
                  privately, but actively, with the larger world of ideas and images.

               <div class="ptext" id="p3">I would like to discuss some ways I make use of that private connection for teaching
                  undergraduate art history, using personal digital devices in the classroom. My goal
                  is
                  twofold: to change the culture of the classroom space; and to expand the traditional
                  materials of teaching art history from a limited group of images to the vast,
                  ever-changing body of images on the Internet. Digital technology allows students to
                  hold
                  much of the known history of art in their hands: a contemporary version of what André
                  Malraux once called the imaginary museum.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">André Malraux (1901-1976) used his French government position as Minister of Cultural
                     Affairs to create an ambitious art-historical project, a multi-volume illustrated
                     collection of world art: <cite class="title italic">La musée imaginaire</cite>
                     (translated, into English, as “museum without walls”). Malraux’s original idea
                     was to create a museum of scale color reproductions, to distribute for display
                     throughout the French provinces. Since this proved unworkable, he ended up with the
                     idea of a book [<a class="ref" href="#grasskamp2016">Grasskamp 2016</a>, 145]. The vision of
                     photographically reproduced objects, removed from their chronological and cultural
                     context and made available to the general public, has obvious parallels with today’s
                     world of digital images.

                     during a single session in 1953. In one image, he is on the floor, in rapt
                     contemplation of a photograph of an artwork from among the many scattered around him.

                     users of digital technology: utter involvement, giving oneself over to a pictorial
                     display, and to seemingly infinite choice.

                     twentieth-century projects.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e256">[1]</a> Aby Warburg’s
                     Bilderatlas Mnemosyne (1927-29) assembled images, from disparate sources, displayed
                     without captions on panels [<a class="ref" href="#johnson2012">Johnson 2012</a>]. This taxonomy of universal
                     culture expressed as a visual repository extended beyond art history; for example,
                     the peace activist Paul Otlet created the Munduneum project of 1934, a world library
                     system that anticipated the field of information science [<a class="ref" href="#vanacker2011">Van Acker 2011</a>]. The notion of linear order, as well as that of classification by time and place,
                     could be undone by the leveling power of photographic reproduction on a large scale.
                     As Stefka Hristova and others have pointed out, digital technology simply increases
                     this capability, revealing the historiographic prescience of Warburg’s cultural
                     analytics [<a class="ref" href="#hristova2016">Hristova 2016</a>].<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e273">[2]</a></div>

                     the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were the forerunners of museums. Along with
                     objects and artworks of all kinds, they included reproductive prints, which
                     functioned as collectible works of art in their own right [<a class="ref" href="#impey2001">Impey and MacGregor 2001</a>].
                     Their catalogues and archives were, in a sense, the first true virtual museums. In
                     the eighteenth century a fashion developed for “paper museums” and
                     “portable galleries,” small-format bound books using printed
                     reproductions of artworks [<a class="ref" href="#bickendorf2010">Bickendorf 2010</a>]. These, like
                     twentieth-century photographic reproductions, were surrogates for physical museum
                     visits.

                     “museum” that exists in cyberspace, based on both physical
                     spaces and the “paper museums” or “portable
                     galleries” of the past; the democratization of images; and the
                     disruption of time and space which are the traditional organizing factors for the
                     teaching of art history. I also want to call attention to the pun on “imaginary”
                     – meaning images as opposed to actual physical objects. I can think of no better
                     homage to the past than the borrowing of Malraux’s concept for portable devices, with
                     the enormous amount of pictorial data, and hence power, they contain.

                     digital technology, after centuries of development as cultural edifices, to enhance
                     the experience of their audiences. In describing museums’ adoption of digital
                     technology (some with hesitation, others wholeheartedly) Hubertus Kohle points out
                     that standards of appropriateness for the consumption of art are constantly changing.
                     Printed books were once perceived as a threat to manuscripts. In academic lectures,
                     looking at slides of artworks was once considered “a betrayal of art… the digital file as the
                     most universal medium ought to stand at the head of the value chain”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#kohle2015">Kohle 2015</a>, 317, 319]. At this point, digital technology not only controls documentation, archiving,
                     sales, and auctions, but is a tool of cultural transformation, creating a ““change in the role of the museum
                     curator, namely from the status of unassailable preceptor to the position of
                     moderator, engaging with increasingly emancipated users”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#kohle2015">Kohle 2015</a>, 320].

                     includes thematic essays, are not only repositories but complex, interactive
                     educational sites, often used by educators to supplement or replace traditional
                     textbooks. Many museums have also opened their collections as searchable databases
                     and created tours on mobile phones. The ongoing Smithsonian Learning Labs explore
                     ways to help K-12 students gain access to previous inaccessible objects and engage
                     with them in and out of the classroom [<a class="ref" href="#milligan2017">Milligan et al. 2017</a>]. SF MOMA’s app,
                     Sendme SFMOMA, allows the public to make informal requests for types of images, using
                     keywords, or even an emoji. MOMA then sends the user a text of an image from its vast
                     collection. As the museum’s creative technologist writes: “When you say ‘Send me a landscape’

                     that were deemed acceptable to buyers and colleagues alike, or trying out into

                     technology. My students are more relaxed; their interest has increased; their
                     analytical skills have improved. (While there are always times when their attention
                     will wander, they usually are too busy using their devices for classroom work to text
                     or check news for very long.) In particular, their grasp of style is especially good;
                     when doing “unknown” identifications on quizzes, their performance
                     is very high. Their visual memories are apparently stimulated after several weeks
                     of
                     developing their digitally created banks of images. Their grades have gone up, on

                     explore the different areas of the museum, while answering a series of thematic
                     questions and choosing objects they encountered as examples. (For the unit on the
                     Baroque, for example: How was art affected by global trade and new scientific
                     knowledge about time and space? How did “passions” theory, the
                     Counter-Reformation, and the new study of classical archaeology affect the production
                     of art? What methods and devices did artists use to express political power and

                     common. As Harris and Zucker put it, “For the first time in history we can
                     reach beyond the walls of the university, and the limited distribution of
                     academic publishers, and we can do so at virtually no additional

                     classroom with movable chairs; this would be difficult in a more traditional
                     lecture hall, where the seats are bolted to the floor, imprisoning the students
                     and isolating them from one another. The issue of classroom design, beyond the
                     scope of this essay, has become more urgent due to advances in digital
