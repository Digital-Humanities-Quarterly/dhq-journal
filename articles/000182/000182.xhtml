               so that, if anything, the digitas now "thinks" us? The short answer to our
               question is as follows: we can think the digitas, but only if we consider it,
               firstly, as a kind of writing ("digital orthography") and,

               heralded the return of the image from its subjection to the linearity of written
               language. Here we extend his concept of the "techno-image"
               (successor of the pre-historical hand-drawn image and the historical printed word),
               to consider the digital image-text that today dominates reading and writing [<a class="ref" href="#flusser2004">Flusser 2004</a>, 40]. <a class="noteRef" href="#d3e227">[1]</a> When Flusser
               ponders this technological revolution in the "Future of
                  Writing", he concludes that old school reader-writers – like us – are
               unable to fathom the world into which we have been thrust because we are chained to a
                  "historical consciousness" based on the sequential, progressive logic of
               syntax and the sentence [<a class="ref" href="#flusser2004">Flusser 2004</a>, 63]. We take this supposed
               inability to come to terms with what Lisa Samuels has called the "digitas" – "civitas, digital acts, habitus, and the
                  digits we call our fingers"
               [<a class="ref" href="#samuels2008">Samuels 2008</a>, 1] – as our point of departure. Our question: Can
               we reader-writers think the digitas, or are we doomed to perform its functions in an
                  "automati[c]" or "robotiz[ed]" fashion [<a class="ref" href="#flusser1999">Flusser 1999</a>, 52], so that, if anything, the digitas now "thinks" us?</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">The idea that the digitas cannot be thought is part and parcel of "posthistory"
               [<a class="ref" href="#flusser2004">Flusser 2004</a>, 144]. Because we reader-writers are caught in a
               predigital "critical" consciousness, the nature of post-history necessarily
               eludes us, hence our anxiety about the loss of history, deep reading and critique
               itself – especially among "the young" (who roll their eyes at the lack of
               techno-savvy of their "olds"). As supposed digital natives fully attuned to the
               image-text, they manipulate the digitas, seemingly without angst, as "functions" of its apparatus [<a class="ref" href="#flusser2005">Flusser 2005</a>, 32]. Though the generational divide between such natives and we
                  "settlers" is often overstated [as in [<a class="ref" href="#prensky2001">Prensky 2001</a>]; see [<a class="ref" href="#sheely2008">Sheely 2008</a>], <a class="noteRef" href="#d3e313">[2]</a> the problem of
               thinking about this technological revolution from our side of the historical divide
               strikes us as real enough – and pressing, given the economic and educational
               implications of "digitisation". In this essay, by way of an answer to our
               question, one that is by virtue of its prophetic nature hypothetical, we reconstruct
               the epochal shift from word to image-text that made possible the world of the digitas
               to locate such other worlds as are possible within it. According to Deleuze, to
               reconstruct a "dispositif", or apparatus, like the digitas
               is to map its "lines of force and flight", that is, its
               constraints and, more importantly for us, its possibilities or "surplus-value"
               [<a class="ref" href="#deleuze1992">Deleuze 1992</a>, 160–161]. <a class="noteRef" href="#d3e342">[3]</a>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">For Flusser, the digital image-text works like the early Wittgenstein’s logical
               proposition. <a class="noteRef" href="#d3e380">[4]</a> It does not refer to
               anything outside of itself, but rather embodies, or "concretizes", a computation [<a class="ref" href="#flusser2005">Flusser 2005</a>, 15]. It is
               not a "thing in the world", but a flat picture-thing that
               concretizes code [<a class="ref" href="#heidegger1992">Heidegger 1992</a>, 188]. Nothing more can be said
               about it than it says itself; to write about it is merely to "illustrate" it – which is, Flusser would say, a reversal of the role that
               images have played for a millennium as illustrations of written texts [<a class="ref" href="#flusser2004">Flusser 2004</a>, 39–41]. Our construction of the digitas, however,
               works much like the later Wittgenstein’s problematising of his earlier work on
               logical propositions: we would argue that there <em class="emph">is</em> something to be said
               that cannot simply be shown – though the flat screen that typifies the digitas seems
               to suggest otherwise. <a class="noteRef" href="#d3e407">[5]</a> The short
               answer to our question, then, as to whether we reader-writers can think the digitas
               or are doomed to be thought by it is as follows: we can read living and lived worlds
               in the digitas, but only if we consider it, firstly, as a kind of writing
                  ("digital orthography") and, secondly, as a caricature of
               thinking, both impoverished and, dare we say it, <em class="emph">funny</em>
                  ("digital caricature"). To put it another way, to attend to
               digital caricature requires attention to writing as image, or impression.</div>

               otherwise, it remains incommunicado. An impression of any kind requires a medium and
               a tool to inscribe it. It is not a question of what it is "out there" or
               independent of us but of the role played in the self in the world by an
               intersubjective system of communication. This is not just a matter of language. The
               world does not press upon us; we are of a piece with it. Rather, a system of
               communication presses upon our relation to the world: on how we relate to it, how we

               service of the exchange of goods – and meanings – informs our interactions with
               others and the environment (in fact, alphanumeric writing began as an impression in
               clay for the purposes of accounting) [<a class="ref" href="#ezzamel2002">Ezzamel and Hoskin 2002</a>, 341–42]; see
                  [<a class="ref" href="#kittler1996">Kittler 1996</a>]. Interaction with the world and others gives rise to
               a perceptual apparatus, a sensorium, that takes on thing-like shapes and structures.
               But an "image", contra Locke’s well-worn argument in <cite class="title italic">An Essay Concerning Human Understanding</cite> for the mind as
                  <em class="emph">tabula rasa</em>, is not the result of the unmediated impact of things

               already been pressed – the physical form, for instance, of Locke’s words or works.

               it, "[t]he more texts one writes (and reads), the more textually
                     one thinks, and the more textually one thinks, the more one writes and

               language that is already pressed upon by the alphanumeric system, with its
               orthography (literally, "straight writing") of selves and things (subjects and
               objects) arranged according to a linear logic of cause and effect (predication). This
               system is the basis of our historical sense qua narrative: to quote Flusser, "the close connection of writing to speaking through the
                     alphabet had the distinctive result that the rules of thought were initially
                     posited as equal to the rules of writing (orthography) and then to the rules of
                     language (logic)"
                   [<a class="ref" href="#flusser2007">Flusser 2007</a>, 20]. However, the kind of discursive logic proposed by the early Wittgenstein,
               following efforts by Alfred Whitehead and Bertrand Russell to found philosophy in
               propositional language, has been superseded by the kind of algorithmic logic that is
               inscribed in our digital technologies [<a class="ref" href="#whitehead1997">Whitehead and Russell 1997</a>, 61–64]. For
               this reason, technology is often mistakenly metaphorized: today, the body is
                  "programmed"; the brain "computes"; etc. Without, then, reducing mental
               processes to the algorithmic operations of the digitas (because we wish to avoid
               technicity [<a class="ref" href="#stiegler1998">Stiegler 1998</a>, 16–17] as much as discursivity [<a class="ref" href="#foucault1998">Foucault 1998</a>, 217–19]), we can admit that what "presses" upon
               and increasingly shapes our mental processes today is digital orthography. No doubt,
               the more image-texts we see on screen, the more screen-wise we think: our Sumerian
               clay is the portable computer. But if our perceptual apparatus is today shaped by
               digitally generated impressions, firstly, how does the digital image-text differ from
               the analog text (assuming, for argument’s sake, that a strict binary exists); and,
               secondly, how can that difference be thought (assuming, once again, that we
               reader-writers can do so)?</div>

               Walter Benjamin, Flusser’s precursor, dwelled on the "aura" of a world in photography, for Flusser, the digital image-text is
               characterized by the loss of a world [<a class="ref" href="#benjamin2008">Benjamin 2008</a>, 22–27 (sections 4–7)]. Flusser argues that black-and-white photographs are
                  "more true" in this sense because they instantiate a
               photographic "proposition" that cannot be mistaken for the

               [<a class="ref" href="#deman1984">De Man 1984</a>, 264]). As he puts it, they "embody the magic of theoretical thought since they transform

               digitas and offering a critical meta-commentary upon its social practices and

               the terms of structural linguistics, the paradigmatic and syntagmatic axes) [<a class="ref" href="#derrida2004">Derrida 2004</a>, 23–25]. Its anti- or self-referential nature echoes
               his epistemologised world-text, the world "over-written",
               or discursified, by the language ("there is nothing outside of the text <span class="foreign i">il n’y a pas de hors-text</span>"
                   [<a class="ref" href="#derrida1997">Derrida 1997</a>, 158]). Derrida’s deconstruction is in this sense proto-digital. But whereas the

               embodies what Paul Virilio has called the "aesthetics of
                  disappearance", the way worlds of reference are collapsed by the speed of
               telecommunications [<a class="ref" href="#virilio1991">Virilio 1991</a>, 62]. More positively, from the
               perspective of Derridean deconstruction, it implies worlds of reference that
               disappear into the "play of différance"
               [<a class="ref" href="#derrida1997">Derrida 1997</a>, 109]. In any case, the world of screens makes the
               question of reference moot: the reader is no longer (or not only) interpreting text
               but (also) concretising code. The "play" of the screen unfolds possibilities
               latent to code and makes "reading" and the "reader" reality effects of a
               digital apparatus. Through their digits, the reader – or better, player – becomes a
               limb, a prosthesis, of the digitas, the functions of which proliferate through the
               feedback of multiple players. To grasp the effects that Flusser variously describes

               and the larger structures into which it is woven (paragraph, section, chapter, book).
               We read the images in series, as Flusser has it, "spooled"
               as scenes into stories and, more largely, histories [<a class="ref" href="#flusser2007">Flusser 2007</a>, 20]. <a class="noteRef" href="#d3e961">[15]</a> To "read" a digital image-text (e-book or online book,

               examples), <a class="noteRef" href="#d3e990">[16]</a> however, is to attend to it as a
               digital system. The meta-commentary of reading as interpretation (or critique) is
               replaced by "reading" as systems analysis (or digital aesthetics),
               the mapping of relations like juxtaposition and recombination, and intensities like
               speed and affect. (We scare-quote digital "reading",
                  "writing" and other descriptors of digital image-texts because
               these terms can only be analogies in the post-historical age.) In the printed text,
               the sentence is a string (hence "spooling"); it is linear and
               sequential, that is, historical. Thus, for Flusser, the function of writing is
               literally to de<em class="emph">line</em>ate images as it interprets them [<a class="ref" href="#flusser2004">Flusser 2004</a>, 66]. To read (or write) right – orthographically – is
               to discursify things in the world (to "script" them) in accordance
               with history. History, or the historical sense, is the physical condition of
               interpretation (to repeat: our sensorium is a scriptorium). But in the digital
               image-text, the "sentence" is a setting; it is taken in all at
               once, as a gestalt. To read (or write) for ideas (from the Greek <em class="emph">idea</em>,
                  "form, pattern", from <em class="emph">idein</em>, "to see"
               <a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1035">[17]</a>)
               – ideographically – is to concretize ideas (to "screen" them) as
               picture-things. Digital "reading" involves scanning the surface of
               the image; digital "writing" becomes mapping possibilities latent
               in code, constructing what might otherwise appear to be a cut-up or collage, a mix of
               text, image and even sound [<a class="ref" href="#kress2005">Kress 2005</a>, 6–11]. This accounts for
               the apparently dynamic nature of digital texts, the way in which they seem to invite
               re-imagination (Flusser calls digital "reading" and
                  "writing"
               "techno-imagination"
               [<a class="ref" href="#flusser2004">Flusser 2004</a>, 67]): we say "seem" because digital texts are
               no more dynamic than analog ones (think of the limited ways in which we can annotate

               rather than spacing the technical condition of the digital
                  "reading" experience. Digital "reading"
               takes no time, hence the negative ascriptions attached to online readers: they are
               merely "browsing", "glancing", "scanning", etc.; they are lazy and
               unable to sustain attention (not that old-school readers didn’t "skim" or
                  "leaf through" texts – or "dip into" their depths). The digital
               image-text is something "readers" look <em class="emph">at</em> and <em class="emph">around</em>,
               not <em class="emph">through</em> – it is shallow, or rather, depthless. The difference
               between this kind of scanning and what we have called scripting can be understood in
               terms of the difference between <em class="emph">parataxis</em> (Gk. "juxtaposition", or
               coordination) and <em class="emph">hypotaxis</em> (Gk. "subordination") in syntax. <a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1119">[18]</a> The former is a principle of
               looking and linking, or <em class="emph">scanning</em>; the latter, of en- and unfolding, or
                  <em class="emph">scripting</em>. Thus, to "read" digital "pages", or hypertext,
               is to look at and link to and from them paratactically; to read print pages, or text,
               is to look through and read "through" (into) them hypotactically. We draw this
               distinction between print and digital reading and writing starkly here, although
               digital "writing" often references print culture with its skeuomorphic lexicon
               of desktops, files, folders, scrolling, pages and so on, and digital "readers"
               often read online in something akin to the way print has always been read. But the
               digital "reader"
               <em class="emph">is</em> doing something significantly different from the print reader. The
               way they read, as they concretise code on the screen, is much like an encounter with
               concrete poetry, as writerly an experience as that seems.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p16">One approaches such an object first of all as an image. It is strictly unreadable as
               a collection of sentences whose overall sense one composes by reading in sequence.
               Instead, one scans the image as a whole and "interprets" it as a shape, rather
               than for its meaning. (Consider when, say, a bridge or shop or playground is
               encountered: seemingly, none require us to interpret them, or even think about them.)
               This takes no time – unlike the "thinking" of interpretation, which can take
               forever. Digital image-texts seem to involve no composition (or "writing") on
               the reader’s part. They appear all of a piece, and are "read", or rather
               received, as such. Concrete poetry responds to the technical revolution of
               mechanically reproduced imagery and presages the properly "digital" moment of
               electronic concretization. Perhaps not coincidentally, the Czech-born Flusser
               developed the insight that the digital image-text is "concretized" code in the
               1950s in Sao Paulo, whence he had emigrated to escape Nazi persecution, and where the
               Brazilian poets of the Noigrandes group (Augusto and Harold de Campos, Décio
               Pignatari and Ronald Azeredo) were developing concrete poetry (see [<a class="ref" href="#wurth2006">Wurth 2006</a>]). In this kind of poem, the concrete – material and visual –
               elements of the text communicate the "poem": it stands for itself, as does the
               digital image-text. It does not refer to anything outside of itself; it is a
               proposition that instances a state of affairs, and thereby concretizes code.</div>

               photography sought the "aura" of the icon in a photograph, and saw it as
               technicized painting, digital settlers seek the worldly "aura" of things in a
               code, and see it as technicized writing – hence our bookish terms for reading on
               screen [<a class="ref" href="#benjamin2008">Benjamin 2008</a>, 22–27 (sections 4–7)]. Yet mechanical
               reproduction is not the issue in the digitas that it is in photography: digital
               image-texts reproduce wildly without a "real-world" referent. Likewise with
               critique: as Flusser sees it, photography awakened for the bookish a
                  "phenomenological doubt" that what they were seeing represented the world
               adequately; the digitas does no such thing [<a class="ref" href="#flusser2005">Flusser 2005</a>, 38].
               While digital settlers might see it as delirium-inducing (we talk about
                  "addiction" and so on), natives simply immerse themselves in

               a caricature of an arm, the idea of digital caricature, we think, is worthy of
               thought. For instance, it prompts questions about the real abstraction in which our
               mental processes are caught up. Thinking as caricature is embodied in the
                  "drop-down menu-isation", or algorithmisation, of so much contemporary
               design: in social media, in architecture – and in teaching and learning. Social media
               programmes like Facebook and Twitter offer an extensive array of "drop-down"
               options to customize our "profile" (a "portfolio self," perhaps), but we
               cannot work outside the options they offer – and these options change based on
               feedback algorithms. <a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1716">[28]</a> Such a profile
               cannot but be a caricature, and literally so. The architectural design of teaching
               and learning spaces in universities often works similarly: in our university, such
               spaces – including our offices – are designed according to spatial algorithms derived
               from our benchmark institutions in the "Group of Eight"
               universities in Australia (single occupant of an office = <em class="emph">x</em> m<span class="hi superscript">3</span> with <em class="emph">y</em> m<span class="hi superscript">2</span>
               window and shelf space + a whiteboard or more shelves or a workbench based on the

               [<a class="ref" href="#sturmandturner2012">Sturm and Turner 2012</a>, 23–34] implied by such spaces is thus

               In one respect, this is <em class="emph">not</em> true of digital "writing" because the
               calculating power of computers now vastly exceeds that of the human brain. In what
               sense, then, do we mean that thinking is diminished by analogy with computation, or
               programming? Here, another sense of caricature becomes key, one that draws together
               Wittgenstein’s later work on rule-following [<a class="ref" href="#wittgenstein1953">Wittgenstein 1953</a>, 80–88 (sections 189-241)], Paulo Virno’s idea that jokes put into question
               the norms governing the application of rules [<a class="ref" href="#virno2008">Virno 2008</a>, 3–8],
               and passing remarks by Terrence Deacon on the evolutionary role of laughter, which
               both recapitulates and rearticulates the primitive bases of social norms of behaviour
                  [<a class="ref" href="#deacon1997">Deacon 1997</a>, 420–421]. The key figure here is the interpretant
               of a sign operation who will understand the caricature and, by seeing that it is
               paradoxical and contradictory, find it funny. If this moment is a critical-creative
               event that is crucial to innovation, indeed to the development of the human animal,
               as Virno suggests, the question is what is required to "get" the joke. </div>
                  <div class="counter">
                     <a href="#p31">31</a>
                  </div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p31">Caricature in this second sense thus refers to something that is conceivably a joke.
               For Virno, a joke "suspends" the norm that would ordinarily enable us to decide
               how the rule should be applied [<a class="ref" href="#virno2008">Virno 2008</a>, 6]. Thought this way,
               a joke suggests a "state of [linguistic] exception" that
               opens out a vertiginous regress [<a class="ref" href="#virno2008">Virno 2008</a>, 5]. What stops this
               regress, on Virno’s reading of Wittgenstein, is social consensus, or the "anthropological backdrop" (or "bedrock") of pre-existing
               social practices, an unspoken agreement that this is how "we" collectively
               understand things [<a class="ref" href="#virno2008">Virno 2008</a>, 5]. This same bedrock, however, is
               the stuff of more primitive drives or instincts, in terms of which a joke can be
               grasped: <blockquote>
                        <p>
                  The joke is the state of exception of discourse because it
                     suddenly edits, once again, the primary scene of every speaker: the grafting of
                     the clausal thought onto nonlinguistic drives. This grafting ... is not simply
                     an ontogenetic episode, but also a permanent dimension of linguistic
                     experience: that dimension, to put it plainly, in which our words imitate that
                     which they substitute (the cry or whatever), thus resembling a thoughtless
                     reaction. Jokes are habitual dwellers in that dimension. Precisely for this
                     reason, they have the appearance of a semi-instinctual drive or, as Freud says,
                     of an "involuntary idea".
                   [<a class="ref" href="#virno2008">Virno 2008</a>, 7]
               </p>
                     </blockquote> Caricature as joke requires this shared basis in the non-symbolic regions of
               drives, which is the accumulated product of the "natural
                  history" of our species [<a class="ref" href="#virno2008">Virno 2008</a>, 3]. With reference
               to Deacon’s <cite class="title italic">The Symbolic Species</cite> and his use of Charles
               Peirce’s triadic sign of symbol, index and icon [<a class="ref" href="#deacon1997">Deacon 1997</a>, 63–65, 74–78], <a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1829">[29]</a> we note that
               getting the joke requires situating, or concretising, the symbolic contradiction or
               paradox within an experiential field that is organised by sign operations that are
               iconic and indexical (that physically resemble their objects or indicate them via a
               sensible feature). Human beings constantly concretise symbolic meaning, in this way,
               cutting across a sharp distinction between mind and material, symbolic and
               non-symbolic species, human and other animals. The interpretant, however, the one who
               gets the joke, must share the biological substrate of the human-animal species in
               order to laugh. As Terrence Deacon says: <blockquote>
                        <p>
                  The ability of jokes and other forms of humour to elicit this
                     stereotypic call [a play signal in mock aggression] is the most curious feature
                     of all. Rather than a function under any selection pressure, it too has
                     probably evolved as an incidental correlate of ... other social functions and a
                     somewhat serendipitous connection to the peculiar symbolic pirouette that
                     constitutes humour.

               but as an intentional joke, we begin to see how the mathesis of a digital norm
               (calculation on the basis of data) has captured and reduced thinking. To think that
               this is "funny" is to presuppose an animal interpretant, or human community,
               that is predisposed to experiencing themselves in more corporeal terms. To put it
               differently, a computer cannot laugh because its sign operation remains strictly
               symbolic. To concretise such caricature in experiential terms requires that we field
               the "ill-logic" of the joke in experiential fields of indexical and iconic
               relations [<a class="ref" href="#sturmandturner2013">Sturm and Turner 2013</a>]. In doing so, the post-critical
               interpretant comes to occupy the position of Michel Serres’ "third man" in a digital pedagogy [<a class="ref" href="#serres1982">Serres 1982</a>, 67].
               Serres’s parasitical "third man" is the noise that must be
               excluded for message to be heard, the condition of the digitas: "The noise is a joker. It has at least two values, like the
                     third man: a value of destruction and a value of construction. It must be
                     included and excluded"
                   [<a class="ref" href="#serres1982">Serres 1982</a>, 67]. But, we would add, such noise requires an interpretant if it is to be taken
               to be a funny, not merely a random, interference. Finding something funny, say, the
               creative assignment of the student who spammed our mailboxes with a view to

               biologically evolved disposition to laugh (and Wittgenstein would add with respect to

               practice itself. The suspension of the norm also supplies, albeit negatively, the
               semiotic "missing link" that Deacon’s Darwinism refuses to allow him to
               identify. This is because, on his account, linguistic ability is always already
               favoured, and therefore "selected in". On this view, symbolic practice has
               always taken place rather than been triggered. It is impossible, we think, not to use

               characteristics that favour the rapid evolution of the linguistic animal, then, we
               must grasp the accident of the object of selection. The human-animal might better be
               described as "opportune", the species that maximises the interruption of a
               seamless experiential field. The "innovation" of the human, Virno might note,

               dialogically – as the effect of bodies on bodies − to generate alternative programs,
               for example, if we use spam "critically-creatively" (for credit, even!), as our
               student did. Spamming thus bears the same relation to the digital character as
               concrete poems do to poetry: where concrete poems foreground the materiality of the
               printed word, spamming foregrounds the digitality of binary code. Our post-critical,
               classroom- and body-based pedagogy thus gets at the comparative impoverishment of
               technical capitalism, despite the superficial allure and intensity of the digitas
