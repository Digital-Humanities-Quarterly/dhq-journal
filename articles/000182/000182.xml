            <head>Introduction</head>
            <p> For Vilém Flusser, philosopher of technology, the advent of photography heralded the
               return of the image from its subjection to the linearity of written language. Here we
               extend his concept of the <soCalled>techno-image</soCalled> (successor of the
               pre-historical hand-drawn image and the historical printed word), to consider the
               digital image-text that today dominates reading and writing <ptr
                  target="#flusser2004" loc="40"/>. <note> What Flusser calls a <cit><quote rend="inline"
                     source="#flusser2005">techno-image</quote><ptr target="#flusser2002" loc="40"/></cit>, or <cit><quote
                     rend="inline" source="#flusser2005">technical image</quote>
                  <ptr target="#flusser2005" loc="14"/></cit>, we call a <term>digital image-text</term>,
                  in order to capture better his sense of the <q>dialectic u[of] image/text</q>, the
                     <q>divorce between text and image</q> in <q>alphabetic culture</q>, that has
                  entered its <q>slow decadence</q> with the advent of digital image-texts [Flusser
                  2012, 1] – and the ambiguous position vis-à-vis the digitas in which predigital
                  reader-writers consequently find themselves. </note> When Flusser ponders this
               technological revolution in the <title rend="quotes">Future of Writing</title>, he
               concludes that old school reader-writers – like us – are unable to fathom the world
               into which we have been thrust because we are chained to a <q>historical
                  consciousness</q> based on the sequential, progressive logic of syntax and the
               sentence <ptr target="#flusser2004" loc="63"/>. We take this supposed inability to
               come to terms with what Lisa Samuels has called the <quote rend="inline"
                  source="#samuels2008">digitas</quote> – <cit><quote rend="inline"
                  source="#samuels2008">civitas, digital acts, habitus, and the digits we call our
                  fingers</quote>
               <ptr target="#samuels2008" loc="1"/></cit> – as our point of departure. Our question: Can
               we reader-writers think the digitas, or are we doomed to perform its functions in an
                  <q>automati[c]</q> or <q>robotiz[ed]</q> fashion <ptr target="#flusser1999"
                  loc="52"/>, so that, if anything, the digitas now <q>thinks</q> us?</p>
            <p>The idea that the digitas cannot be thought is part and parcel of <cit><quote
                  rend="inline" source="#flusser2004">posthistory</quote>
               <ptr target="#flusser2004" loc="144"/></cit>. Because we reader-writers are caught in a
               predigital <q>critical</q> consciousness, the nature of post-history necessarily
               eludes us, hence our anxiety about the loss of history, deep reading and critique
               itself – especially among <q>the young</q> (who roll their eyes at the lack of
               techno-savvy of their <q>olds</q>). As supposed digital natives fully attuned to the
               image-text, they manipulate the digitas, seemingly without angst, as <quote
                  rend="inline" source="#flusser2005">functions</quote> of its apparatus <ptr
                  target="#flusser2005" loc="32"/>. Though the generational divide between such
               natives and we <q>settlers</q> is often overstated [as in <ptr target="#prensky2001"
               />; see <ptr target="#sheely2008"/>, <note> For the liminal third category of the
                     <q>digital settler</q> (<q>digital natives</q> and <q>immigrants</q> being the
                  other categories), see <ptr target="#palfrey2008" loc="3–4"/>. </note> the problem
               of thinking about this technological revolution from our side of the historical
               divide strikes us as real enough – and pressing, given the economic and educational
               implications of <q>digitisation</q>. In this essay, by way of an answer to our
               question, one that is by virtue of its prophetic nature hypothetical, we reconstruct
               the epochal shift from word to image-text that made possible the world of the digitas
               to locate such other worlds as are possible within it. According to Deleuze, to
               reconstruct a <quote rend="inline" source="#deleuze1992">dispositif</quote>, or
               apparatus, like the digitas is to map its <quote rend="inline"
                  source="#deleuze1992">lines of force and flight</quote>, that is, its
               constraints and, more importantly for us, its possibilities or <cit><quote rend="inline"
                  source="#deleuze1992">surplus-value</quote>
               <ptr target="#deleuze1992" loc="160–161"/></cit>. <note>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#deleuze1992">Disposition</quote> – or construction
                  – looks at both lines of <quote rend="inline" source="#deleuze1992"
                     >visibility</quote>, <quote rend="inline" source="#deleuze1992"
                     >enunciation</quote>, <quote rend="inline" source="#deleuze1992"
                     >force</quote>, and <quote rend="inline" source="#deleuze1992"
                     >subjectification</quote>, and lines of <quote rend="inline"
                     source="#deleuze1992">fracture</quote> and <quote rend="inline"
                     source="#deleuze1992">flight</quote>
                  <ptr target="#deleuze1992" loc="160–161"/>: respectively, lines of <quote
                     rend="inline" source="#deleuze1992">stratification or sedimentation</quote>
                  (territorialization) and <quote rend="inline" source="#deleuze1992">lines

                     target="#deleuze1992" loc="165"/>. </note>
            </p>
            <p>For Flusser, the digital image-text works like the early Wittgenstein’s logical
               proposition. <note> For the <quote rend="inline" source="#wittgenstein2001">picture
                     theory</quote> of language, see <ptr target="#wittgenstein2001" loc="9–12"/>.
               </note> It does not refer to anything outside of itself, but rather embodies, or
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#flusser2005">concretizes</quote>, a computation
                  <ptr target="#flusser2005" loc="15"/>. It is not a <quote rend="inline"
                  source="#heidegger1992">thing in the world</quote>, but a flat picture-thing
               that concretizes code <ptr target="#heidegger1992" loc="188"/>. Nothing more can be
               said about it than it says itself; to write about it is merely to <quote
                  rend="inline" source="#flusser2004">illustrate</quote> it – which is, Flusser
               would say, a reversal of the role that images have played for a millennium as
               illustrations of written texts <ptr target="#flusser2004" loc="39–41"/>. Our
               construction of the digitas, however, works much like the later Wittgenstein’s
               problematising of his earlier work on logical propositions: we would argue that there
                  <emph>is</emph> something to be said that cannot simply be shown – though the flat
               screen that typifies the digitas seems to suggest otherwise. <note> For <quote
                     rend="inline" source="#wittgenstein1953">language games</quote>, see <ptr
                     target="#wittgenstein1953" loc="11–12 (section 23)"/>; for his repudiation of
                  the <quote rend="inline" source="#wittgenstein1953">picture theory</quote>of
                  language, see <ptr target="#wittgenstein1953" loc="43–50"/> (sections 94-125).
               </note> The short answer to our question, then, as to whether we reader-writers can
               think the digitas or are doomed to be thought by it is as follows: we can read living
               and lived worlds in the digitas, but only if we consider it, firstly, as a kind of
               writing (<soCalled>digital orthography</soCalled>) and, secondly, as a caricature of
               thinking, both impoverished and, dare we say it, <emph>funny</emph>
                  (<soCalled>digital caricature</soCalled>). To put it another way, to attend to
               digital caricature requires attention to writing as image, or impression.</p>

               </cit>), but we only know <q>it</q> by the impression that it makes upon us;
               otherwise, it remains incommunicado. An impression of any kind requires a medium and
               a tool to inscribe it. It is not a question of what it is <q>out there</q> or
               independent of us but of the role played in the self in the world by an
               intersubjective system of communication. This is not just a matter of language. The
               world does not press upon us; we are of a piece with it. Rather, a system of
               communication presses upon our relation to the world: on how we relate to it, how we
               go about in it and how we talk about it. <note>In this, we – and Flusser – differ
                  from Heidegger, who is concerned with the self (<quote rend="inline"
                     source="#heidegger1992">Dasein</quote> as <cit><quote rend="inline"
                     source="#heidegger1992">a self-interpreting, self-articulating entity</quote>
                  <ptr target="#heidegger1992" loc="302"/></cit>: where his concern is phenomenology, ours
                  is <quote rend="inline" source="#flusser2004">communicology</quote> (see
                  Flusser’s <title rend="quotes">On the Theory of Communication</title>
                  <ptr target="#flusser2004" loc="8–20"/>). </note> What <q>impresses</q> us is not
               so much the world as the various forms its impressions have taken.</p>
            <p>For we reader-writers, the development of the alphanumeric writing system in the
               service of the exchange of goods – and meanings – informs our interactions with
               others and the environment (in fact, alphanumeric writing began as an impression in
               clay for the purposes of accounting) <ptr target="#ezzamel2002" loc="341–42"/>; see
                  <ptr target="#kittler1996"/>. Interaction with the world and others gives rise to
               a perceptual apparatus, a sensorium, that takes on thing-like shapes and structures.
               But an <soCalled>image</soCalled>, contra Locke’s well-worn argument in <title
                  rend="italic">An Essay Concerning Human Understanding</title> for the mind as
                  <emph>tabula rasa</emph>, is not the result of the unmediated impact of things
               upon our perceptual apparatus that gives rise to impressions mentally compounded in
               the form of <quote rend="inline" source="#locke1996">simple</quote> and <quote
                  rend="inline" source="#locke1996">complex ideas</quote>
               <ptr target="#locke1996" loc="40"/>. Rather, an image, for our orthographical
               aesthetics, is shaped by writing systems into the service of which language has
               already been pressed – the physical form, for instance, of Locke’s words or works.
               Our sensorium is a <emph>scriptorium</emph>.</p>
            <p>What we call digital orthography (the digitas considered as writing, that is)
               concerns writing systems rather than language per se because the latter can be
               thought only through the former. Writing dominates modernity because, as Flusser puts
               it, <cit>

               the more image-texts we see on screen, the more screen-wise we think: our Sumerian
               clay is the portable computer. But if our perceptual apparatus is today shaped by
               digitally generated impressions, firstly, how does the digital image-text differ from
               the analog text (assuming, for argument’s sake, that a strict binary exists); and,
               secondly, how can that difference be thought (assuming, once again, that we

               of digital image-texts because these terms can only be analogies in the

                  <soCalled>spooling</soCalled>); it is linear and sequential, that is, historical.
               Thus, for Flusser, the function of writing is literally to de<emph>line</emph>ate
               images as it interprets them <ptr target="#flusser2004" loc="66"/>. To read (or
               write) right – orthographically – is to discursify things in the world (to
                  <soCalled>script</soCalled> them) in accordance with history. History, or the
               historical sense, is the physical condition of interpretation (to repeat: our
               sensorium is a scriptorium). But in the digital image-text, the
                  <soCalled>sentence</soCalled> is a setting; it is taken in all at once, as a
               gestalt. To read (or write) for ideas (from the Greek <emph>idea</emph>, <q>form,
                  pattern</q>, from <emph>idein</emph>, <q>to see</q>
               <note>For ideas and seeing, see <ptr target="#heidegger2002" loc="36–39"/>. </note>)
               – ideographically – is to concretize ideas (to <soCalled>screen</soCalled> them) as
               picture-things. Digital <soCalled>reading</soCalled> involves scanning the surface of
               the image; digital <soCalled>writing</soCalled> becomes mapping possibilities latent
               in code, constructing what might otherwise appear to be a cut-up or collage, a mix of
               text, image and even sound <ptr target="#kress2005" loc="6–11"/>. This accounts for
               the apparently dynamic nature of digital texts, the way in which they seem to invite
               re-imagination (Flusser calls digital <soCalled>reading</soCalled> and
                  <soCalled>writing</soCalled>
               <soCalled>techno-imagination</soCalled>
               <ptr target="#flusser2004" loc="67"/>): we say <q>seem</q> because digital texts are
               no more dynamic than analog ones (think of the limited ways in which we can annotate
               a PDF).</p>
            <p>It is this instantaneous recognition of the digital image-text that makes speed
               rather than spacing the technical condition of the digital
                  <soCalled>reading</soCalled> experience. Digital <soCalled>reading</soCalled>
               takes no time, hence the negative ascriptions attached to online readers: they are
               merely <q>browsing</q>, <q>glancing</q>, <q>scanning</q>, etc.; they are lazy and
               unable to sustain attention (not that old-school readers didn’t <q>skim</q> or
                  <q>leaf through</q> texts – or <q>dip into</q> their depths). The digital
               image-text is something <q>readers</q> look <emph>at</emph> and <emph>around</emph>,
               not <emph>through</emph> – it is shallow, or rather, depthless. The difference
               between this kind of scanning and what we have called scripting can be understood in
               terms of the difference between <emph>parataxis</emph> (Gk. <q>juxtaposition</q>, or
               coordination) and <emph>hypotaxis</emph> (Gk. <q>subordination</q>) in syntax. <note>

                     I am the light of the world</quote> [John 9:5]. </note> The former is a
               principle of looking and linking, or <emph>scanning</emph>; the latter, of en- and
               unfolding, or <emph>scripting</emph>. Thus, to <q>read</q> digital <q>pages</q>, or
               hypertext, is to look at and link to and from them paratactically; to read print
               pages, or text, is to look through and read <q>through</q> (into) them
               hypotactically. We draw this distinction between print and digital reading and
               writing starkly here, although digital <q>writing</q> often references print culture
               with its skeuomorphic lexicon of desktops, files, folders, scrolling, pages and so
               on, and digital <q>readers</q> often read online in something akin to the way print
               has always been read. But the digital <q>reader</q>
               <emph>is</emph> doing something significantly different from the print reader. The
               way they read, as they concretise code on the screen, is much like an encounter with
               concrete poetry, as writerly an experience as that seems.</p>

            <p>One approaches such an object first of all as an image. It is strictly unreadable as
               a collection of sentences whose overall sense one composes by reading in sequence.
               Instead, one scans the image as a whole and <q>interprets</q> it as a shape, rather
               than for its meaning. (Consider when, say, a bridge or shop or playground is
               encountered: seemingly, none require us to interpret them, or even think about them.)
               This takes no time – unlike the <q>thinking</q> of interpretation, which can take
               forever. Digital image-texts seem to involve no composition (or <q>writing</q>) on
               the reader’s part. They appear all of a piece, and are <q>read</q>, or rather
               received, as such. Concrete poetry responds to the technical revolution of
               mechanically reproduced imagery and presages the properly <q>digital</q> moment of
               electronic concretization. Perhaps not coincidentally, the Czech-born Flusser
               developed the insight that the digital image-text is <q>concretized</q> code in the
               1950s in Sao Paulo, whence he had emigrated to escape Nazi persecution, and where the
               Brazilian poets of the Noigrandes group (Augusto and Harold de Campos, Décio
               Pignatari and Ronald Azeredo) were developing concrete poetry (see <ptr
                  target="#wurth2006"/>). In this kind of poem, the concrete – material and visual –
               elements of the text communicate the <q>poem</q>: it stands for itself, as does the
               digital image-text. It does not refer to anything outside of itself; it is a
               proposition that instances a state of affairs, and thereby concretizes code.</p>

            <p>The historical image relies on objectivity, namely, the subject-object relation, and

               This apparent ontological convergence of zero and one is the basis of real
               abstraction, or concretization, the function of which is to de-world history and
               re-world it through the digital image-text as gestalt. <note> Compare <ptr

               presents – or projects – concepts as images, as ideographs, begins the end of the era
               of historical consciousness.</p>
            <p> Historical consciousness did not vanish all at once; indeed, we still tend to think
               about the digitas in historical terms. Digital settlers like us are prey to what
               might be called, after Walter Benjamin, <q>auratic</q> thinking: just as those new to
               photography sought the <q>aura</q> of the icon in a photograph, and saw it as
               technicized painting, digital settlers seek the worldly <q>aura</q> of things in a
               code, and see it as technicized writing – hence our bookish terms for reading on
               screen <ptr target="#benjamin2008" loc="22–27 (sections 4–7)"/>. Yet mechanical
               reproduction is not the issue in the digitas that it is in photography: digital
               image-texts reproduce wildly without a <q>real-world</q> referent. Likewise with
               critique: as Flusser sees it, photography awakened for the bookish a
                  <q>phenomenological doubt</q> that what they were seeing represented the world
               adequately; the digitas does no such thing <ptr target="#flusser2005" loc="38"/>.
               While digital settlers might see it as delirium-inducing (we talk about
                  <soCalled>addiction</soCalled> and so on), natives simply immerse themselves in
               the endless present of a code-world. </p>
            <p> The advent of the digital image-text that enables users to record information and
               manipulate it – in photography, film and then television (leaving aside audio
               production) <ptr target="#kittler1999"/> – foreshadowed a post-historical and
               post-industrial epoch dominated by programming and algorithms, that is, by
               calculation. <note> For calculation and calculability – or <emph>mathesis</emph> – as
                  characteristic of modern technicity, see <ptr target="#stiegler1998" loc="3–4"/>;
                  for the (unfortunate) nexus of the digitas and mathesis in the digital humanities,
                  see <ptr target="#drucker2009"/>. </note> Photographic images can thus be seen in
               two ways: firstly, as the product of light from the world of objects outside
               imprinted on celluloid inside the camera, creating an analog image – negative, but an
               exact copy nonetheless – that can be reproduced, that is, as mimetic; secondly, as a
               projection of information stored by the apparatus of the camera, creating a digital
               image-text that can be produced, that is, recalculated, according to different
               algorithms, hence as mathetic. Analog images signify objects; digital image-texts
               signify codes.</p>
            <figure>
               <head>The first digital scan, Russell Kirsch’s <emph>Walden</emph> (1957), which

            </figure>
            <p>We thus move from the copy/re-presentation, or abstraction, of an object to the
               projection/present-ation, or concretization (or <q>real abstraction</q>) of a code.
               And because the code is mathetic, number, not letter, is inscribed as the dominant
               means of measure in the post-historical age.</p>
            <p>The all-consuming digitas, increasingly a space where users are all consumers, or
                  <q>prosumers</q> who create digital <q>content,</q> expands capital exchange.
                  <note> See <ptr target="#ritzer2010"/>. The term <q>prosumer</q> is, of course,
                  Alvin Toffler’s from <emph>The Third Wave</emph>
                  <ptr target="#toffler1980" loc="265ff"/>. </note> But it is not technical
               capitalism per se, or enterprise, but rather the <soCalled>enhanced</soCalled>
               techniques of measurement that it permits – econometrics, or <q>e-conometrics</q>, if
               we take them to be marked by their digital nature – that are the real innovation and
               commodity of the age (and our real target). <note> For technical capitalism, or
                     <q>technocapitalism</q>, see <ptr target="#suarezvilla2009"/>. </note> One such
               econometric springs to mind: our university’s online and <q>in-line</q> (fully
               strategically <q>aligned</q>) <soCalled>Research Outputs Module</soCalled> tool
               designed to enable us to generate outputs via its <soCalled>PBRF tool</soCalled> to
               complete our PBRF <soCalled>evidence portfolios</soCalled>. <note> The
                  Performance-Based Research Fund (PBRF) is the New Zealand Government’s
                  performance-based block funding mechanism for research akin to the UK’s Research
                  Assessment Exercise (RAE) and Australia’s Excellence in Research for Australia
                  (ERA). </note> Such econometric programmes embody the self-referentiality of the
               digitas: their <soCalled>reference</soCalled> is simply a projected output, a
               yet-to-be-concretized possibility of their code. This is not to say that such
               programmes don’t have a very <q>real</q> effect on our <q>outputs</q> and <q>real</q>
               effects throughout the university: they generate ideographs that are vehicles not
               just for ideas but for ideology, ideographs that concretize not only concepts, but
               also the interests of capital. The idea that academics should create research and
               teaching portfolios – and increasingly e-portfolios – does not echo in name only the
               investment portfolios of technical capitalism: in such portfolios, we are tasked to
                  <q>package</q> our work and ourselves as <q>products</q> of and for the
               university, and to account for – to measure – our own <q>performance</q> in terms of
               its actual and potential <q>returns</q> on the university’s <q>investment</q> (of the
               buzzwords here, only <q>performance</q> would be official university parlance – as of
               now, at any rate).</p>
            <p>The corollary of the digital image-text, then, is technical capitalism: what presses
               on language today is not just digitalized code, but fully capitalized code. If, as we
               have noted, the digital image-text appears as a gestalt, so does the digital world in
               which we find ourselves immersed as soon as it appears; it is as if, to rephrase
               Derrida (or rather, Ricoeur), we were <emph>always already</emph> online <ptr
                  target="#ricoeur1990" loc="57"/>. The digitas thus enables capitalism to
                  <emph>re-world</emph> the many worlds we inhabit according to econometrics of
               productivity by which ideas must turn a profit, viz. a return on <q>capital</q>
               (literally, <q>head-count,</q> from the Latin <emph>caput</emph>, <q>head</q>). Or
               rather, the de-worlding of worlds of history and <q>re-worlding</q> of post-history
               involves a reconstruction of thinking to more acutely attune it to the delivery and
               measurement of outputs, or <q>outcomes</q>, be that GDP, GNP (Gross National Product)
               or GNH (Gross National Happiness) – or even PBRF or University rankings. Such
               thinking is not critical, but <emph>quantized</emph> (literally, <q>calculated</q>).
               To quantize, as Figure 8 suggests, is to approximate a continuously varying signal
               (here, the smooth analog wave) by one whose amplitude is restricted to a prescribed
               set of values, no matter how <q>lossless</q> (here, the jagged digital line, a.k.a.
                  <q>jaggie</q>). This is exactly what econometrics do.</p>

            <p>The linear, historical logic of written text and critique is giving way to the
               algorithmic, post-historical logic of computation and calculation (see <ref
                  target="#table01">Table 1</ref>). Similarly, representation is giving way to
               concretization; analog images, to digital (or technical) images (see <ref
                  target="#table03">Table 3</ref>). What we have is a new hieroglyphics of technical
               imagination, a digital orthography that is really an ideography; its <q>big idea</q>
               is technical capitalism, namely, business enterprise supplemented by a digitally
               enhanced system of measure, an <emph>e-conometrics</emph>. This new <q>language</q>
               of the digital character is embodied not only in media such as photography, film and
               television, which are considered iconic digital media (see <ptr target="#kittler1999"
               />), but also in designs (iconic brands) and environments (iconic buildings).</p>
            <p>Importantly, such digital icons don’t represent or refer to anything. Rather, they
               point to something we can <emph>do</emph>; they proffer a communicative world in
               which we find ourselves with others, acting out our objectives and enacting various
               effects – in other words, programming and being programmed. And they intensify the
               worlds they <q>iconise,</q> through the multiple (inter)activities of multiple users,
               hence the immediacy and intimacy of digital affect. This communicativity is a
               technical operation, continuously updating and upgrading itself by ever more accurate
               – or <q>efficient</q> – measurement of users’ (inter)activity. The icons of the
               digital character are thus inherently communicative. While it is a problem that the
               message digital icons communicate is monopolised by technical capitalism, it is the
               co-optation of the virtue of critical-creative thinking – now called
                  <q>innovation</q> – to link enterprise and technological development that is most
               concerning.</p>
            <p>One response to what seems a grim situation – the <soCalled>Flusser
                  problem</soCalled>, so to speak – is not to recall criticism to its hallowed role
               as social conscience and to reboot history: to speak truth to power (the
                  <soCalled>Foucault solution</soCalled>). <note> For such <soCalled>fearless
                     speech</soCalled>, see <ptr target="#foucault2001"/>. </note> To be heard at
               all today we must speak truth <emph>in</emph> power rather than truth <emph>to</emph>
               power, which is to say, inside communicative networks that are technically amplified
               by our talk <ptr target="#dean2010"/>. <emph>Post</emph>-criticism foregrounds the
               noise of digital <q>writing</q>, that which is neither discursive nor merely
               technical in writing, those values and worlds which are <q>screened out</q> by the
               digitas. It depends on caricature, not critique. We would argue that there are two
               senses of digital caricature: the first is digital caricature, in the sense of
               impoverished, or diminished, thinking, which is the tendency to think about thinking
               in terms of given technologies, namely, as programming. The second sense of digital
               caricature relies on Charles Peirce’s idea of an <q>interpretant</q>, or reader,
               someone for whom digital caricature might also be funny, or diverting in both senses
               of the word <ptr target="#pierce1974" loc="50–52"/>.</p>
            <p>Taking caricature in the first sense, consider Flusser on simulation <ptr
                  target="#flusser1999" loc="51–54"/>. <note> Compare Flusser on <q>electronic
                     memories</q> as simulations of <q>the memory
                     functions of the human brain</q>: <title rend="quotes">On Memory
                     (Electronic or Otherwise), </title><title rend="italic">Leonardo </title>23.4
                  (1990): 398 (397-99). </note> A lever, he suggests, simulates an arm: in one
               respect, namely lifting, a lever is an arm. In many other respects (texture,
               movement, pliability), it is a caricature of an arm. To think that a lever is an arm
               is to make the same mistake as thinking that the body is programmed (by DNA) or that
               the brain computes (by the firing of neurons), both of which mistakes caricature
               thinking. <note> For an example of this kind of work by a leading neuroscientist, see
                     <ptr target="#koch2013"/>. </note> For us, the technical operation of the
               digital character, or any attempt to ontologise that operation through an appeal to
               its mathetic substrate, is a caricature of thinking.</p>

            <p>Although digital <q>writing</q> may be as much a caricature of thinking as a lever is
               a caricature of an arm, the idea of digital caricature, we think, is worthy of
               thought. For instance, it prompts questions about the real abstraction in which our
               mental processes are caught up. Thinking as caricature is embodied in the
                  <q>drop-down menu-isation</q>, or algorithmisation, of so much contemporary
               design: in social media, in architecture – and in teaching and learning. Social media
               programmes like Facebook and Twitter offer an extensive array of <q>drop-down</q>
               options to customize our <q>profile</q> (a <q>portfolio self,</q> perhaps), but we
               cannot work outside the options they offer – and these options change based on
               feedback algorithms. <note> For the <q>portfolio self</q>, see <ptr
                     target="#king2007" loc="338"/>; elsewhere, he describes a <quote rend="inline"

                     loc="9–12"/>.</note> Such a profile cannot but be a caricature, and literally
               so. The architectural design of teaching and learning spaces in universities often
               works similarly: in our university, such spaces – including our offices – are
               designed according to spatial algorithms derived from our benchmark institutions in
               the <soCalled>Group of Eight</soCalled> universities in Australia (single occupant of
               an office = <emph>x</emph> m<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> with <emph>y</emph> m<hi
                  rend="superscript">2</hi> window and shelf space + a whiteboard or more shelves or
               a workbench based on the discipline of the occupant, etc.). The <quote rend="inline"

               <ptr target="#sturmandturner2012" loc="23–34"/> implied by such spaces is thus
                  <q>capsular</q> or generic <ptr target="#decauter2002" loc="275"/>, and thus
               caricatural.</p>

               <graphic url="resources/images/figure10.jpg"/>
            </figure>
            <p>Caricature may thus be considered a sketch, a diminished version of something else.
               In one respect, this is <emph>not</emph> true of digital <q>writing</q> because the
               calculating power of computers now vastly exceeds that of the human brain. In what
               sense, then, do we mean that thinking is diminished by analogy with computation, or
               programming? Here, another sense of caricature becomes key, one that draws together
               Wittgenstein’s later work on rule-following <ptr target="#wittgenstein1953"
                  loc="80–88 (sections 189–241)"/>, Paulo Virno’s idea that jokes put into question
               the norms governing the application of rules <ptr target="#virno2008" loc="3–8"/>,
               and passing remarks by Terrence Deacon on the evolutionary role of laughter, which
               both recapitulates and rearticulates the primitive bases of social norms of behaviour
                  <ptr target="#deacon1997" loc="420–421"/>. The key figure here is the interpretant
               of a sign operation who will understand the caricature and, by seeing that it is
               paradoxical and contradictory, find it funny. If this moment is a critical-creative
               event that is crucial to innovation, indeed to the development of the human animal,
               as Virno suggests, the question is what is required to <q>get</q> the joke. </p>
            <p>Caricature in this second sense thus refers to something that is conceivably a joke.
               For Virno, a joke <q>suspends</q> the norm that would ordinarily enable us to decide
               how the rule should be applied <ptr target="#virno2008" loc="6"/>. Thought this way,
               a joke suggests a <quote rend="inline" source="#virno2008">state of [linguistic]
                  exception</quote> that opens out a vertiginous regress <ptr target="#virno2008"
                  loc="5"/>. What stops this regress, on Virno’s reading of Wittgenstein, is social
               consensus, or the <quote rend="inline" source="#virno2008">anthropological
                  backdrop</quote> (or <q>bedrock</q>) of pre-existing social practices, an unspoken
               agreement that this is how <q>we</q> collectively understand things <ptr
                  target="#virno2008" loc="5"/>. This same bedrock, however, is the stuff of more
               primitive drives or instincts, in terms of which a joke can be grasped: <cit>
                  <quote rend="block" source="#virno2008">The joke is the state of exception of
                     discourse because it suddenly edits, once again, the primary scene of every
                     speaker: the grafting of the clausal thought onto nonlinguistic drives. This
                     grafting ... is not simply an ontogenetic episode, but also a permanent
                     dimension of linguistic experience: that dimension, to put it plainly, in which
                     our words imitate that which they substitute (the cry or whatever), thus
                     resembling a thoughtless reaction. Jokes are habitual dwellers in that
                     dimension. Precisely for this reason, they have the appearance of a
                     semi-instinctual drive or, as Freud says, of an <quote rend="inline"

               </cit> Caricature as joke requires this shared basis in the non-symbolic regions of

                  triadic definition of a sign as something that represents, or signifies, an object
                  to some interpretant in one of three ways: an <emph>icon</emph> physically
                  resembles its object (a picture of your face is an icon of you); an
                     <emph>index</emph> denotes its object by virtue of some sensible feature that
                  correlates with and thus <q>points to</q>, or indicates, it (your smile indicates
                  your happiness); a <emph>symbol</emph> denotes its object by virtue, primarily, of
                  a convention, agreement or rule – it is thus, in some sense, normative (the word
                     <q>smile</q> denotes a certain range of facial expressions in English) [after
                     <ptr target="#burks1949" loc="673–74"/>. </note> we note that getting the joke
               requires situating, or concretising, the symbolic contradiction or paradox within an
               experiential field that is organised by sign operations that are iconic and indexical
               (that physically resemble their objects or indicate them via a sensible feature).
               Human beings constantly concretise symbolic meaning, in this way, cutting across a
               sharp distinction between mind and material, symbolic and non-symbolic species, human
               and other animals. The interpretant, however, the one who gets the joke, must share
               the biological substrate of the human-animal species in order to laugh. As Terrence
               Deacon says: <cit>
                  <quote rend="block" source="#deacon1997">The ability of jokes and other forms of
                     humour to elicit this stereotypic call [a play signal in mock aggression] is
                     the most curious feature of all. Rather than a function under any selection
                     pressure, it too has probably evolved as an incidental correlate of ... other
                     social functions and a somewhat serendipitous connection to the peculiar

            </p>
            <p>While we do not share Deacon’s rigorous Darwinism, we agree that the joke requires a
               deeply acquired affective experience of other bodies. The accident of meaning that
               suspends the norm – as in the case of a joke − is grasped or graspable, because, as
               Catherine Malabou notes, we <cit>

               </cit>.</p>
            <p>When caricature is understood not as simply a diminished version of something else,
               but as an intentional joke, we begin to see how the mathesis of a digital norm
               (calculation on the basis of data) has captured and reduced thinking. To think that
               this is <q>funny</q> is to presuppose an animal interpretant, or human community,
               that is predisposed to experiencing themselves in more corporeal terms. To put it
               differently, a computer cannot laugh because its sign operation remains strictly
               symbolic. To concretise such caricature in experiential terms requires that we field
               the <q>ill-logic</q> of the joke in experiential fields of indexical and iconic
               relations <ptr target="#sturmandturner2013"/>. In doing so, the post-critical
               interpretant comes to occupy the position of Michel Serres’ <quote rend="inline"
                  source="#serres1982">third man</quote> in a digital pedagogy <ptr
                  target="#serres1982" loc="67"/>. Serres’s parasitical <quote rend="inline"
                  source="#serres1982">third man</quote> is the noise that must be excluded for
               message to be heard, the condition of the digitas: <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#serres1982">The noise is a joker. It has at least
                     two values, like the third man: a value of destruction and a value of

                  <ptr target="#serres1982" loc="67"/>
               </cit>. But, we would add, such noise requires an interpretant if it is to be taken
               to be a funny, not merely a random, interference. Finding something funny, say, the
               creative assignment of the student who spammed our mailboxes with a view to
               demonstrating Serres’ principle, <note> We draw here on the work of a student who

               </cit>). The joke is an accident of meaning that recalls the evolution of symbolic
               practice itself. The suspension of the norm also supplies, albeit negatively, the
               semiotic <q>missing link</q> that Deacon’s Darwinism refuses to allow him to
               identify. This is because, on his account, linguistic ability is always already
               favoured, and therefore <q>selected in</q>. On this view, symbolic practice has
               always taken place rather than been triggered. It is impossible, we think, not to use
               the word <q>accident</q> at this point and, with reference to Malabou’s notion of <cit>

               </cit>, to think that the precarity of the human animal hinges upon this accident.

               event of symbolic meaning, which is to say the accident of meaning itself, is what
               jokes <q>incidentally</q> recall. Before we can grasp the selection of acquired
               characteristics that favour the rapid evolution of the linguistic animal, then, we
               must grasp the accident of the object of selection. The human-animal might better be
               described as <q>opportune</q>, the species that maximises the interruption of a
               seamless experiential field. The <q>innovation</q> of the human, Virno might note,
               was thus some kind of a joke, a meaning-making accident.</p>
            <p>The digital classroom need not simply be considered in terms of the technical
               infrastructure of the university and the econometrics that inform it. The

               programming – for example, in spamming – may involve a true caricature in Virno’s
               sense. Such a moment reveals not only the structure of the joke as signifier, but
               also the structure of forces that it instances, its <quote rend="inline"

               even!), as our student did. Spamming thus bears the same relation to the digital
               character as concrete poems do to poetry: where concrete poems foreground the
               materiality of the printed word, spamming foregrounds the digitality of binary code.
               Our post-critical, classroom- and body-based pedagogy thus gets at the comparative
               impoverishment of technical capitalism, despite the superficial allure and intensity
               of the digitas that concretizes it. In Serres’ sense, we may be uninvited guests at
               the digital menu who crave something other than what is preprogrammed <ptr

            <p>Caricatural thinking is particularly problematic in teaching and learning, given that
               learning institutions are, as Flusser puts it, the <cit>

                  <ptr target="#flusser1999" loc="49"/>
               </cit> (because commodities are increasingly intellectual <ptr target="#berardi2011"
               />) and that learning is increasingly online (and thus increasingly
               <q>digitized</q>). Our worry is that we are simply educating students to apply
               econometric algorithms at the expense of all other codes, others’ or their own,
               discovered (heuristic) or recovered (historical): for example, ways of writing that
               privilege a certain linear and teleological (or <q>end-stopped</q>) style of argument
                  <ptr target="#sturm2012"/>, and the constructive alignment of aims, objectives and
               outcomes in curricula (a curriculum of means and ends, perhaps <note> On the
                     <q>means-end reasoning</q> of the standard <q>technical production [curriculum]
                     perspective</q> of Ralph Tyler and others, see <ptr target="#posner1998"/>.
               </note>) that encourages teachers to teach to the test and students to learn likewise
                  <ptr target="#sturmandturner2011" loc="167–168"/>. Instead, we would reconstruct
               the classroom, analog or digital, on the basis of learning games that foster jokes in
               Serres’ sense (hacks, or <q>exploits,</q> they might be called in the language of the
               digitas <note> For the <q>exploit</q> as <quote rend="inline"
                     source="#galloway2007">a resonant flaw designed to resist, threaten, and

                     target="#galloway2007" loc="21"/>. </note> – to encourage the innovation of
               which computers themselves are one product, but, critically, to which our capacity to
               laugh is not itself reducible. To do so, we would <q>up the noise floor</q> of the
               classroom to problematise – laugh at, in short – all such caricatural thinking and
               locate such other worlds of <quote rend="inline" source="#deleuze1992">surplus
                  value [or values]</quote> as are possible within the world of the digitas <ptr
                  target="#deleuze1992" loc="161"/>. Flusser calls such problematisation <quote
                  rend="inline" source="#flusser2011b">alternative program[ming]</quote>, which,
               he says, goes beyond <quote rend="inline" source="#flusser2011b"
                  >self-programming</quote>, or <quote rend="inline" source="#flusser2011b">having

               <ptr target="#flusser2011b" loc="155"/></cit>. The former is a critical move; the latter,
               post-critical. Alternative programming does not claim that we can escape the digitas
               to speak truth, as it were, <emph>to</emph> its power; it claims that if we cannot
               escape it, then we can speak truth (or better, truths) <emph>in</emph> its power.</p>
