         <dhq:abstract>
            <p>The Web, though full of historical information, lacks a means of organizing that
               information, searching on it or visualizing it. The Historical Event Markup and
               Linking Project (Heml) was begun six years ago to explore how disparate historical
               materials on the Internet can be navigated and visualized, and for the past four
               years has used an XML data format defined in W3C Schemas. This format aims for
               conforming data that can be quickly parsed but provide a variety of facets on which
               to search for historical materials. While the project's graphical visualizations are
               in some respects successful, they have revealed some deficiencies in the underlying
               data format: it ought to provide for nested events, it ought to represent relations
               of causality between events and it ought to express the varieties of scholarly
               opinion about the attributes of events. By encoding the Heml data in the Resource
               Description Framework (RDF) it is possible to undertake these improvements. Moreover,
               an RDF-encoded Heml process provides easier access to CIDOC-CRM data into Heml
               events. Finally, a historical RDF language would simplify the discovery of references
               to historical events in digitized texts, thereby automating a growing network of
               historical information on the Web.</p>

               shows how classicists will soon be able to <q>Google the Past</q>: that is, search
               for pertinent evidence and scholarship through to the chronology and geography of
               historical events and view the search results in suitable formats such as
               hyper-linked maps. </p>

            <head>Introduction</head>
            <p>Beginning his work which was to be the first called a <q>history</q>, the Greek
               author Herodotus describes his task in simple terms: <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#canonical">to preserve the memory of the past by putting on
                     record the astonishing achievements both of our own and of other
                     peoples</quote>
                  <ref type="offline">line 1.0</ref>
               </cit>. Within the first few chapters, though, it becomes clear that, to Herodotus,
               this entails something more multivalent than mere story-telling. His very next
               sentence buttresses the narrative with references to its various, even conflicting,
               sources <ref type="offline">1.1</ref>; not much later, he corroborates his stories by
               referring to physical artifacts and providing careful genealogies <ref type="offline"
                  >1.7</ref>, <ref type="offline">1.14</ref>; and throughout he attempts to place
               the notable events of the past within the available chronological outlines (e.g, <ref
                  type="offline">16.1</ref>). From its origins, then, history has been conducted
               across a framework of argumentation, evidence, chronology and prosopography.</p>
            <p>This intellectual approach, begun by Herodotus and his rough contemporaries around
               the world, has proved a durable and useful way of thinking. Moreover, as the global
               Internet expands, and the common software technologies of the World Wide Web provide
               us with unprecedented means of communication, humanity has greater access to more
               historical statements and more of the raw materials of history than ever before.
               Indeed, it might be said that today's Web has the makings of an historian's fantasy:
               it provides worthy encyclopedia entries on a vast array of topics; its textual
               editions are rapidly improving in quality and amassing in quantity; and it offers
               historical source material ranging from argumentation in on-line editions of the best
               journals to the first-hand accounts appearing in blog entries. Scholarly historical
               projects published uniquely on the Web are common, supported by academic centres
               whose purpose is to communicate history effectively in new media, and who are also
               addressing the general problems of adopting best standards of scholarship to the Web
               in projects such as <ref target="http://www.zotero.org">Zotero</ref>. Behind the
               scene, data formats such as the CIDOC-CRM aim to make it possible to interchange and
               reconcile vast cultural archives. </p>
            <p> However what today's Web offers in historical content, it lacks in organization. The
               multivalent nature of historical thought that we noted in one of its earliest
               practitioners eludes the keyword-indexed approach to the Web today on offer through
               Google and other search engines. Though we can summon up an exhaustive list of Web
               resources that contain the <emph>words</emph>
               <q>Gallipoli</q> and <q>sources</q>, today's Web cannot effectively respond to a
               basic historical question such as, <q>which sources attest the Gallipoli Campaign of
                  World War I?</q> much less a more advanced one such as, <q>what evidence is there
                  for major architectural projects undertaken in the U.K. during the period of the
                  Boer War, and does anyone think that these projects are influenced by the
                  conflict?</q> If it were possible to conduct such a query, of course the result
               would not itself qualify as <q>history</q> any more than the results of a Google
               search constitute knowledge. However, the results of such a hypothetical search would
               offer a considerable aid to historical research and thinking, just as the indices,
               maps and, occasionally, tables that appear at the end of most monographs allow the
               reader rapidly to access matters of interest. Applying this analogy, what is needed
               in the Web is <q>universal back-matter</q>, a Web-wide equivalent to the traditional
               print monograph's helpful conventions.<note xml:id="n7">
                  <p>It might be observed that since <ref target="http://www.wikipedia.org"
                        >Wikipedia</ref> has made great strides in organizing historical information
                     on the Web, the (seemingly inevitable) continued growth of this resource will
                     fulfil this goal. However, as an encyclopedia, Wikipedia does not aim to be
                     exhaustive. Its <ref target="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wikipedia:notability"
                        >notability guidelines</ref> rightly forbid a great deal of material to
                     which historians might wish to have ready access. Moreover even those Wikipedia
                     article which do explain historical events cannot comprise exhaustive lists of
                     references, secondary sources and other evidence. As described later in this
                     paper, the Heml Project has has good experiences using the <ref

            <p>Herodotus and his successors have given us a template for such a project. Minimally,
               it will need to express associations between words describing the event through
               chronology, geography and prosopography. It will need to provide references to
               diverse sources and evidence, and it will need to traverse, as much as possible, the
               boundaries of local language and even local time-keeping techniques.<note xml:id="n8">

               employed the same basic types of data <ptr target="#thaller1991"/>; however, the
               Internet has added the challenge of working with a more heterogeneous set of data
               sources and today's possibilities for the visualization of historical data go far
               beyond the Workstation's.<note xml:id="n1">
                  <p>The <ref target="http://ecai.org">Electronic Cultural Atlas Initiative</ref>
                     has developed a coordinated network of databases, whose limited access helps to
                     ensure the authority and quality of the aggregated data. A windows application
                     is available for entering conforming data, and the excellent <ref

            <p> The Historical Event Markup and Linking Project (Heml) has pursued the vision of a
               system such as this since 2001, when it began to explore the markup and
               transformation of historical materials on the Internet using XML tools. All schemas
               and code developed by this project are available at its website, <ref
                  target="http://www.heml.org/">http://www.heml.org/</ref> and complete revision
               history is provided in an SVN repository. This paper explains Heml's next step toward
               the goal of an historical Web. It outlines the data format used by the project, shows
               the shortcomings of our previous XML-based approach to historical markup and
               describes the potential of an historical markup scheme based around the W3C's
               Resource Description Framework, or <ref target="http://www.w3.org/tr/rec-rdf-syntax/"
                  >RDF</ref>, to interchange historical concepts widely and to express them in a
               more nuanced manner. </p>
            <p>It is a pleasure to be able to offer this paper in the collection of works
               celebrating the achievements of Ross Scaife. Like so many efforts in computing and
               the Classics, this one has been nurtured by Ross' kind support and encouragement.
               Furthermore, I have always hoped that Heml would attain the level of openness and
               helpfulness that are the hallmarks of Ross' work and of his character.</p>

            <head>The Heml Data Model</head>
            <p>The goal of a searchable network of historical information can only be reached
               through a clear separation between the model of the data being searched, the
               parameters of the search and the resulting visualization of the data. Since the
               project intends that these visualizations be generated dynamically in response to
               users' queries, the data model must be specific enough that the visualization can
               generated quickly; likewise, since the results of users' queries could result in no
               events, one event, or thousands of events, and the range of values represented in
               these encoded events could be quite wide, the visualization processes must be written
               so as to generate useful views without regard for the number of events visualized or
               how close or far they are in time and space. For this reason, the Heml project has
               attempted to steer a middle path between pragmatism and markup idealism, especially
               regarding chronology. Thus, its data schema, on one hand, is not a complete
               abstraction of any way in which a person might think of the past, since this would
               make the task of visualization too daunting. In particular, its schema requires
               machine-readable data for all defined geographical and chronological data. (As shown
               below, this does not preclude the schema representing uncertainty.) On the other
               hand, the schema is not merely an API for the various visualizations offered by Heml;
               it is abstract enough that many other visualizations and uses could be
               discovered.</p>
            <p> At its inception, the Heml server software transformed XML documents one-by-one <ptr
                  target="#robertson2002"/>; in versions 0.4 to 0.7.2 the project adopted a
               distributed XML model, backed up by the <ref target="http://www.exist-db.org"
                  >eXist</ref> XML database <ptr target="#robertson2004"/>, an approach that worked
               well in a collaboration with Tom Costa's project, <ref
                  target="http://www.vcdh.virginia.edu/gos/"> Geography of Slavery in
               Virginia</ref>, where a Heml Web application backed by eXist transforms events
               pertaining to slaves into hundreds of dynamically generated maps and timelines. In
               either case, the project's data model has remained the same for the past four years,
               and the following describes the model labelled 2003-09-17.</p>
            <p> The Heml data format contains a collection of modelled events, each tagged with
                  <code>heml:Event</code>. At their most simple, events bind an event label with a
               machine-readable span of time and a reference to evidence, which could be as simple
               as a single URN. Optionally, a <code>heml:Event</code> may also comprise any number
               of keywords, and a single location, which in turn is defined as a labelled pair of
               latitude and longitude coordinates. <code>heml:Person</code> elements may be added to
               events in order to represent those people who were in some way involved in the event.
               If the nature of this participation is known, the <code>heml:Person</code> element
               may be bound to a <code>heml:Role</code> element within the context of the event.
               Persons, roles, locations, and keywords are assigned mandatory URIs so that they may
               be referred to in multiple events. Finally, one or more <code>heml:Evidence</code>
               elements must be attributed to each event, and within these there is a means by which
               different editions and linguistic representations of the same text may be grouped
               together for the researcher's benefit.</p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <head>Chronology</head>
            <p>The most complex part of Heml's data model is the <code>heml:Chronology</code>
               element. Its model is intended to express uncertainty and ranges of time without
               requiring the visualization engine to have access to all data.<note xml:id="n0">
                  <p>This precludes the use of the exhaustive representation of temporal expressions
                     in natural language that the <ref target="http://timeml.org">TimeML</ref>
                     markup language provides.</p>
               </note> In Heml markup, chronological concepts are always built using one of the
               following four elements: <code>heml:DateTime</code>, <code>heml:Date</code>,
                  <code>heml:Year</code> or <code>IntCalDate</code>. The first three of these
               encapsulate data encoded in the corresponding XML Schemas format; the last permits
               the user to encode with a non-Gregorian calendar. When used alone, these elements are
               meant to indicating a corresponding span of time: for instance the
                  <code>&lt;heml:Year&gt;-31&lt;heml:Year&gt;</code> indicates an event that began
               on the first second of the first day of 31 BC and ended on the last second of its
               last day. To express a more expanded range of time, the <code>heml:DateRange</code>
               element is used, and within it mandatory <code>heml:StartingDate</code> and
                  <code>heml:EndingDate</code> elements. This construct is parsed as indicating a

               of the last one. To express uncertainty, the <code>heml:BoundedDate</code> element is
               used. It comprises a <code>heml:TerminusPostQuem</code> and a
                  <code>heml:TerminusAnteQuem</code> element; these express the earliest possible
               and latest possible time respectively of a span of uncertain time. Use alone,
                  <code>heml:BoundedDate</code> makes no claim about the duration of the encoded
               event. However, it is permitted to use a <code>heml:BoundedDate</code> within the
                  <code>heml:StartingDate</code> or <code>heml:EndingDate</code> of a
                  <code>heml:DateRange</code>. <dhq:example xml:id="example01">

            <p>There are other schemas from other fields that encode representations of labelled
               spans of time and place. <ref target="http://dublincore.org/">Dublin Core</ref>
               Metadata standard includes date and location tags that, in certain uses, encode
               certain kinds of historical events, but these naturally revolve around the documents
               themselves, such as publication information; they cannot, for instance, encode the
               battle described therein. Similarly, the P5 edition of the TEI includes a welcomed
               set of <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/activities/workgroups/pers/">biographical
                  and prosopographical tags</ref>, including one for events. However, at present,
               all such P5 <code>event</code> elements must appear within a <code>person</code> or
                  <code>place</code> element, expressing that the event information serves to
               further our information about a given person or place: events that pertain to neither
               at present cannot be encoded. </p>
            <p> Finally, the <ref target="http://cidoc.ics.forth.gr/">CIDOC-CRM</ref> encodes
               descriptions of cultural artifacts in terms of the events they undergo — their
               creation, change of custody, and so forth. Though not the primary focus of this
               schema, historical events are quite broadly modelled in this schema. Indeed, as is
               shown below, the unmodified CIDOC-CRM model is too liberal for the Heml Project's
               purposes of generating historical visualizations, especially with reference to what
               entities and datatypes it accepts as chronological predicates. Nevertheless, it is
               likely that most of the goals of the Heml project can be fulfilled through RDFS
               subclassing of the the CIDOC-CRM model, ensuring more carefully data-typed
               chronological classes. In any case, the discussion and examples below would apply as
               well to such a constrained CIDOC-CRM model or to any future schema with similar
               properties. Indeed, the purpose of the Heml project is decidedly not to promote a
               particular schema; instead, its schema is intended as a tool which enables us to
               explore the process of combining all material encoded in all these well-entrenched
               and widely-adopted schemas so as to increase the pool of inter-related historical
               data on the Internet. </p>
            <p>Technologically, there is little challenge in transferring data from one of these
               representations to Heml. XML representations can be exchanged through XSLT. In RDF,
               the SPARQL <ref target="http://www.w3.org/tr/rdf-sparql-query/#construct"
                  >CONSTRUCT</ref> query form produces transformations from one graph to another.
               For example, <ptr target="#robertson2006"/> shows how useful a simple Heml and Dublin
               Core mash-up conducted in XSLT could be. </p>

            <head>Visualizations</head>
            <p>Heml data is encoded in order that resources pertaining to a certain historical event
               may be found in response to a user's query. The query might be expressed with regard
               to any one of the facets of historical expression encoded by the schema above, or on
               some combination of these. The software discovers the corresponding materials, then
               generates a visualization of these data according to the user's wishes.
               Visualizations range from simple chronological text lists in HTML to complex animated
               maps. Of course, since the data has been prepared without reference to any given
               visualization, not all visualizations are informative representations of all query
               results. For instance, an animated map would not be helpful if the set of events in
               the query response all had the same location or did not have locations encoded at
               all.</p>
            <p>In the most recently-published version of Heml's server software (v. 0.7.2),
               visualizations are generated through a Java Web application based on the <ref
                  target="http://cocoon.apache.org">Cocoon Web</ref> service engine. Instructions
               for building and running this software locally are available at <ref
                  target="http://www.heml.org">http://www.heml.org</ref>. Using this approach on
               locally-stored data takes full advantage of Cocoon's ability to cache server-side
               processes. However, it is also possible to use the server at <ref
                  target="http://www.heml.org">http://www.heml.org</ref> to transform any conforming
               document published on the Web without building or installing software. Instructions
               are provided online.</p>
            <p> As described above, all the visualization tools developed by the project operate
               fully automatically: they provide sensible chronological and geographical boundaries
               based only on the conforming data on their input and layout the appropriate text
               without clipping or abbreviation, regardless of the number of events being
               presented.</p>
            <p>The graphical timeline view, of which <ref target="#figure02">Figure 2</ref> and <ref
                  target="#figure03">Figure 3</ref> are examples, lays out event labels at a
               vertical distance from each other corresponding to their separation in time. It
               indicates spans of time through vertical coloured lines. This view was designed to be
               legible and to require as little user interaction as possible, emulating a graphical
               timeline in print. In fact, the rendering software iterates through layout scenarios
               in order to find one that is appropriately compact but whose text is still possible
               to read. It ensures that the entire text labelling an event is always visible to the
               user, and scrolling is not necessary to read the event label. The software also
               selects an appropriate range of dates or times for the events; these can range from a
               seconds to millennia.<note xml:id="n2">
                  <p>See the timeline views of the <code>columbia_accident</code> and

               </note> Rendered in SVG, this view's event labels are linked to popups that lead the
               reader to the resources pertaining to the event. </p>
            <p>This approach to timeline-generation differs from other online graphical
               timeline-drawing, perhaps best represented by the the Simile <ref
                  target="http://simile.mit.edu/timeline/">timeline</ref> widget. At present, the
               Simile timeline is not auto-ranging, and does not attempt to optimize layout. Rather,
               its documentation encourages users to identify so-called <q>hot zones</q>, temporal
               ranges comprising unusually large numbers of events so that the drawing routine can
               alter the scale in these ranges, thereby producing a more legible layout. The goals
               of the Heml project, requiring a fully automated rendering, do not make such
               hand-tweaking possible. However, Simile timeline's excellent use of client-side
               rendering and DHTML are certainly preferable to the Heml timeline approach. We hope
               that by modify the open-source code for Simile timelines we can adopt that project
               more closely to our needs, perhaps by identifying <q>hot zones</q>
               computationally.</p>

            <p>Another event-visualization system pioneered by the Heml Project is the animated map
               illustrated in <ref target="#figure01">Figure 1</ref>. <hi rend="bold">(1)</hi> is a
               set of user-operated controls familiar from audio-visual apparatus. With these, the
               user can stop, play pause, rewind and speed up the animation. Item <hi rend="bold"
                  >(2)</hi> is a slider control that sets the length of the animation in seconds.
               Item <hi rend="bold">(3)</hi> is a moving marker that runs along the line above the
               animation from left to right, thereby indicating the moment in time currently
               represented on the map. Above the small triangle a constantly updating text appears
               recording the current animation time. The event labels at <hi rend="bold">(4)</hi>
               appear in red text as long as the animation is representing a date during which the
               labelled event is encoded as having taken place. In order that the user be able to
               read them, event labels do not necessarily disappear as soon as the corresponding
               event ends in the animated time; rather they remain on the screen in black text until
               the text has appeared for at least two seconds. The system designates an appropriate
               chronological scale to the process, as well as the geographical range of the map.</p>

            <head>Areas For Improvement</head>
            <p>Although these visualizations have fulfilled some of our goals, they have also
               pointed out some deficiencies in the underlying data model. <ref target="#figure01"
                  >Figure 1</ref>, for example, presents an apparent mishmash of events. Perhaps the
               user undertook a too-broad query, but when dealing with any large dataset this sort
               of result is common because the XML schema puts all events, no matter how trivial, on
               the same footing. It has therefore been suggested that events should be ranked, or
               should nest, with large scale events such as <q>The Persian Wars</q> expressed as
               parents of their composite events, like <q>The Battle of Thermopylae.</q> In response
               to publications and presentations of the Heml/XML model, others have expressed a
               desire for more complex historical relations between events to be encoded. Should not
               Heml express something as simple as causality, such as the fact that Ephialtes'
               treachery led to the defeat of the Three Hundred? Finally, it has been noted that
               with Heml/XML markup it is not possible to encode the variations in opinions
               regarding historical events. When scholars debate the date of the arrival of the
               Greek-speaking ancestors of the Mycenaeans, what date should be encoded for this
               event?</p>
            <p>Some of these issues have been tackled recently by <ptr target="#nakahira2007"/>, but
               in the Heml XML Schema they were intentionally left unaddressed for both theoretical
               and practical reasons. First, it has been this project's experience that resolving
               such relations with a language such as <ref target="http://www.w3.org/tr/xquery/"
                  >XQuery</ref> or XSLT was difficult and computationally expensive. Secondly, since
               the XML Schema expresses matters pertaining to an event by nested elements, it was
               unclear where a statement linking two elements should appear. Pertaining no more to
               one element than the other, ideally it should stand outside the
                  <code>heml:Event</code> elements, but this raised the prospect of always new
               schemas required to provide metadata for previous schemas. Finally, a XML schema
               through which scholarly debate could be encoded for any facet of an event seemed
               likely to be unmanageably complex.</p>

            <head>RDF and Heml</head>
            <p>Our work of the past year shows that these problems can be addressed by using the
               W3C's Resource Description Framework (RDF) as our means of encoding Heml events and
               related information.<note xml:id="n3">
                  <p>Tim Berners-Lee's <ref target="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/primer.html"
                        >Primer</ref> on RDF is a good introduction for those new to the
                     subject.</p>
               </note> As a collection of statements expressed through URIs, RDF is well suited to
               define metadata that expresses associations between events. Because these statements
               are unordered, these associations can be asserted in any source of data, anywhere.
               Moreover, RDF defines a method known as <q>reification</q> whereby a statement
               comprising Subject Verb and Object can itself play the role of subject or object in
               another, encompassing statement. <ref target="#example02">Example 2</ref> illustrates
               the process with an example from Greek prehistory. The first line makes a simple
               statement, without attribution, that the ancestors of the Mycenaeans arrived in the
               Greek mainland in 1600 BC. The second line indicates the reification of that
               statement with parentheses, and attributes this chronology to Drewes with the
                  <code>hemlRDF:asserts</code> predicate. The third line refers to the same
                  <code>&lt;#Arrival_of_the_Greeks&gt;</code> subject, but it shows that Renfrew
               assigns that subject a much earlier date. <dhq:example xml:id="example02">
                  <head>RDF Reification as A Means of Encoding Scholarly Debate Regarding an

                     (&lt;#Arrival_of_the_Greeks&gt; &lt;hemlRDF:simpleDate -6000) </eg>
               </dhq:example> The URI corresponding to a scholar then becomes a part of the query,
               and it is possible to encode, and later summon up, an entire body of knowledge with
               reference to the scholar asserting it. For example, the chronology of fifth-century
               Athens could be encoded with reference to the arguments of Badian or those of
               Pritchett. This technique becomes all the more important when even more tendentious
               predicates are applied, such as causation. <note xml:id="note_reification">
                  <p> Two widely recommended means of RDF reification that appear to be sufficient

               <p> Despite these possibilities, we were concerned that the increased
                  representational complexity of RDF would make it difficult for students and other
                  users to encode their data. In fact, in the summer of 2007 we had excellent
                  experience using the <ref
                     target="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/semantic_mediawiki">Semantic
                     MediaWiki</ref> extension to MediaWiki as a HemlRDF editor. With this
                  environment, motivated students as young as ten years old produced dozens of
                  fully-compliant RDF-encoded events with an hour's work. The resulting RDF is not
                  identical to the HemlRDF parsed by the Web application because certain
                  simplifications were considered helpful to the user.<note xml:id="n4">In
                     particular, since Semantic Media Wiki treats each node is an article, nodes

                     with in this Wiki extension.</note> However, a simple SPARQL query, available
                  in the <code>/sparql/wiki/</code> directory of the project SVN repository,
                  transforms the data to HemlRDF. With some work, or as Semantic MediaWiki improves,
                  it might be possible for it to generate HemlRDF directly, thereby allowing

                  of the parent; and the latest date on which any child ends is treated as the

                  parsing the RDF model in memory, it is hoped that the same effect could be made

               <p>One of the most exciting possibilities we anticipated in the historical RDF realm
                  was visualizing CIDOC-CRM data through Heml tools. Because the CIDOC-CRM defines
                  objects in terms of the events they undergo, CIDOC-CRM potentially is a treasure
                  trove of well-encoded events related to material culture. Robert Kummer of the
                  Perseus Project kindly provided us with the Perseus art and archaeology database
                  encoded in RDF/XML. <ref target="#example04">Example 4</ref> is a small portion of
                  this, in which the item known as 'BCMA 1919.58.81' is declared to have been
                  produced no earlier than 480 BC.</p>

               </dhq:example>
               <p>Note that the non-heml date elements encode time using a URI. Since the purpose of
                  CIDOC-CRM is to identify and coordinate the resources, this is a wholly
                  appropriate use. However, any RDF application that is acting on this as a date,
                  Heml included, will need to access it as a literal, preferably with appropriate
                  datatyping. We used Perl regex to insert a sister element to the
                     <code>Time_Primitive</code>. Since this might not always be easy to do,
                  developers of CIDOC-CRM data who wish to explore the data in systems like Heml
                  would be well advised also to generate literals for dates and locations that
                  employ standard datatypes such as the <code>xsd:gYear</code> illustrated
                  above.</p>
               <p>A SPARQL query — available in our SVN server — transforms the rest of the
                  CIDOC-CRM into HemlRDF, which then can be processed by the visualization tools and
                  viewed alongside events encoded in other schemas.</p>

               <head>Heml's Future</head>
               <p> From its inception, the XML-based Heml has used the Apache Cocoon Web service
                  framework to store data, to set controller values and to transform data into the
                  views shown above. In the experiments regarding the potential of RDF illustrated
                  above, we grafted the <ref target="http://jena.sourceforge.net/">Jena RDF
                     parser</ref> into this system, using it as a means of down-converting Heml RDF
                  data into the XML format around which the Heml Web service framework grew.<note
                     xml:id="n6">
                     <p>While appropriate XML can be converted to RDF with an XSLT transformation
                        (and the Heml Project has therefore provided such a transformation for many
                        years), the opposite is not true: there is no XML-based tool that can
                        reliably convert RDF (in its standard XML format) into a sister, non-RDF,
                        XML format.</p>
                  </note> The resulting system and its critical components are illustrated in <ref
                     target="#figure04">Figure 4</ref>. This is a heavy-weight, server-side toolkit
                  out of keeping with modern trends in Web software. Although the project strives to
                  make its software freely available through GPL licensing, the general
                  effectiveness of Heml has been reduced because of the project's server-side
                  orientation. <figure xml:id="figure04">

               </p>
               <p>Since the advanced features of Heml described above will require RDF technologies,
                  our project proposes next to remove the XML format entirely from its processing
                  pipeline. Ideally, we wish to follow the general trends of Web computing and pass
                  all processing over to the client; it will occasionally call its server for
                  additional RDF data. The proposed architecture is illustrated in <ref
                     target="#figure05">Figure 5</ref>. <figure xml:id="figure05">
                     <head>Block Diagram of the Components of the Projected Heml Software. Future

                     <figDesc>The process stack of Heml</figDesc>
                  </figure> Although its data store and communication are modelled in RDF, this
                  system still can consume any (non-RDF) XML that is of historical interest, such as
                  the biographical P5 TEI tags. An appropriate XSLT stylesheet converts such
                  materials to XML-encoded RDF. Finally, since it appears that declarative animation
                  in the SVG format is being abandoned, Heml will explore other vector graphics
                  formats and likely use the popular cross-platform Flex3 platform from Adobe. We
                  are also adopting of third-party visualization tools that have arisen in recently,
                  such as <ref target="http://simile.mit.edu/timeline/">Simile Timeline</ref> and
                  the <ref target="http://www.openlayers.org">OpenLayers</ref> mapping suite.</p>
               <p>The combination of the SPARQL query language and RDF is reasonably powerful, but
                  it lacks some temporal capabilities which we have had to add through extension
                  functions written for the Joseki SPARQL server engine. For instance, while the
                  SPARQL specification permits the query to request a response that is ordered by
                  one or more datatyped values, the only temporal datatype that it will order in
                  this way is <code>xsd:DateTime</code>, that is, dates specified to the second; the
                  specification does not indicate how to order dates specified to the year or day,
                  much less to compare between these datatypes. Our extension function uses <ref
                     target="http://jena.hpl.hp.com/~afs/sparql-update.html">SPARQL Update</ref> to
                  apply to the in-memory RDF graph a starting and ending <code>xsd:DateTime</code>
                  corresponding to the beginning and ending of the chronological ranges indicated by
                  these other datatypes. Further improvements in chronological analysis could be
                  made through the use of the CIDOC-CRM's predicates based on Allen temporal logic
                     <ptr target="#allen1983"/> and further use of SPARQL/Update.<note

                  <p>Finally, we plan to undertake the automated discovery of references to
                     historical events in unexplored digitized texts. We can expect these texts to
                     be created in ever-increasing numbers, either by large-scale endeavours like
                     the Open Archive Initiative, by the Google Books project, or through local
                     efforts such as the one described in <ptr target="#carrera2005"/>, which become
                     more practical as improved Optical Character Recognition software is developed
                     in large-scale endeavours. The method described below was inspired by Greg
                     Crane, whose published thoughts on the topic began in <ptr target="#crane2006"
                     />.</p>
                  <p>
                     <ptr target="#smith2002"/> and the work of the <ref
                        target="http://www.timeml.org">TimeML</ref> group show how effectively
                     extracted named entities and natural language processing techniques can be used
                     to identify events. While these natural language processing approaches discover
                     hitherto unidentified events — typically from newspaper articles — we intend to
                     apply some of the same machine learning techniques to discover references to
                        <emph>canonical</emph> events, already encoded and stored in HemlRDF. (Such
                     canonical events would be extracted from standard reference works.) This system
                     thus could train linear classifiers with the persons and places associated with
                     an event, as well as other additional features encoded in HemlRDF. For
                     instance, the appearance of a reference to a primary source already associated
                     with an event would be a strong indication that that event is being discussed.
                     While in some disciplines it would be a considerable task to accurately
                     identify such references with the one on record in the RDF database, Smith's
                     work on <ref target="http://chs75.harvard.edu/projects/diginc/techpub/cts"
                        >Canonical Text Services</ref> promises to simplify the task. The event's
                     label will also serve as a useful feature, especially if it were parsed with
                     the <ref

               <p> RDF technologies are providing Heml with several new avenues for research and a
                  plan for reinventing its means of delivering historical visualizations. If it is
