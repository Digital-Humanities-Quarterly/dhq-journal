                     include more women in the work of science. Aspects of the "science question" that consider the politics underlying
                     epistemologies of "purportedly value-neutral claims and

                  infrastructure and reflects a tie between information studies and the humanities.
                  These ties include, among other things, "the technology,
                  services, practices, and policy" that support "publication practices, data, research methods,

                  creating technological infrastructure in the humanities must be collaborative, based
                  on common understandings that pertain to the work both information studies and
                  digital humanities are doing to build and theorize this infrastructure.
                  Reconsidering this work by using the lens of feminist inquiry to understand the

               <div class="ptext" id="p3">In terms of practice, the ties between digital humanities and information science
                  seem obvious. Digital humanities comprises ways of practice that are afforded by
                  algorithms and accessed through interfaces and visualizations; practices that are
                  articulated and organized by metadata and databases and social networks that are
                  designed within institutions and fields of study that have been informed by the
                  sciences, the social sciences, by human computer interaction (HCI), and computer
                  science; practices that are very often transacted within the context of digital
                  resources from archives and libraries. Finally, these are practices accomplished by
                  workers visible and invisible from scores of fields of inquiry in the humanities and
                  fields associated with information science.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e224">[1]</a>

               <div class="ptext" id="p4">Ultimately, feminist critique concerns a responsibility to ask questions about these
                  practices, to better understand the epistemologies embedded within these histories
                  of knowledge production, to reframe the practices of digital humanities as
                  information work and vice versa – a reframing that ultimately broadens and deepens
                  the conversation. Feminist inquiry is particularly useful because its modes of
                  inquiry are steeped in the sciences, the social sciences, and the humanities. Donna
                  Haraway has written that the science community considers knowledge production as "histories of the technologies"
                   [<a class="ref" href="#haraway1988">Haraway 1988</a>, 587]. Yet, from a feminist perspective, we are ultimately responsible not only to
                  be self-conscious or self-aware of technologies as "ways of
                  life, social orders, practices of visualization" but "<em class="emph">to become answerable</em> to what we learn how to
                  see"
                   [<a class="ref" href="#haraway1988">Haraway 1988</a>, 583]. As such, in this discussion, I consider how thinking about the tie between
                  digital humanities (DH) and information science through feminist inquiry can help
                  us
                  become answerable to the manner in which DH work — its ways of practice — are shaped
                  by (and shape) ways of life and social orders.

               <div class="ptext" id="p5">The <em class="emph">technologies </em>that I discuss here, however, are not always digital.
                  Martha Nell Smith has very usefully defined humanist technologies as "the means by which we accomplish various ends — the tools
                  and devices on which our critical suppositions rely"
                   [<a class="ref" href="#smith2005">Smith 2005</a>, 306]. Smith has argued that the relationship between humanities disciplines and
                  feminist scholarship in DH is reflected in four areas in which she sees fundamental
                  ties revealed: <em class="emph">technologies of access</em>, <em class="emph">multimedia study
                     objects</em>, <em class="emph">collaboration</em>, and <em class="emph">self-consciousness</em>.
                  In this same vein, in the three sections of this discussion, I reposition what I am
                  calling the DH technologies of <em class="emph">interdisciplinarity</em>,
                  <em class="emph">mastery</em>, and <em class="emph">self-consciousness</em> with feminist notions
                  of <em class="emph">situatedness</em>, <em class="emph">plausibility</em>, and
                  <em class="emph">responsibility</em>. These three sections demonstrate how feminist modes
                  of inquiry that allow us to see commonalities between information science and
                  digital humanities may help us articulate a concern with situated, not transcendent
                  knowledges; with embodied objectivity and plausibility rather than truth; and with
                  a
                  responsibility to not only learn how systems work, technically, socially, and
                  psychically but to act on that knowledge and build information infrastructures that
                  reflect humanistic concerns.

                        position that seems to fit comfortably in the humanities. Cathy N. Davidson
                        and David Theo Goldberg maintain that it is essential that the humanities
                        remain at the forefront of academic inquiry because "the interdisciplinary modes of the humanities . . .
                        concern basic constitutive features of the social sciences,
                        sciences, technology and the professions"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#davidson2004">Davidson and Goldberg 2004</a>, 57]. Similarly, Bruno Latour posits that the humanist’s job should be to
                        assemble these interdisciplinary modes instead of debunking them and to
                        offer "the participants arenas in which to gather"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#latour2004">Latour 2004</a>, 246]. Indeed, <em class="term">interdisciplinarity</em> (and its accompanying
                        metaphors of collaborative assembly and gathering) have been touted as
                        potential keys to resolving crisis in the humanities, which constellate
                        among a variety of practical concerns such as decreased enrollment in
                        humanist studies, decreased jobs for recent PhDs, limited opportunities for
                        publishing and therefore a weakened tenure process; and philosophical issues
                        that concern the role of the humanities in the university. Most importantly
                        for this discussion, there is also a pervasive notion that
                        <em class="term">interdisciplinarity </em>is a basic and <em class="emph">natural</em>
                        tenet of accomplished digital work [<a class="ref" href="#abel2004">Abel 2004</a>, 339]; [<a class="ref" href="#mcgann2005">McGann 2005</a>, 71]; [<a class="ref" href="#smith2005">Smith 2005</a>, 312];

                        allows for and precludes certain kinds of interactions to happen. I have
                        written about the very real and situated institutional parameters that must
                        be in place in order to support what Smith calls the "technology of collaboration" in DH [<a class="ref" href="#clement2013">Clement 2013</a>]
                        [<a class="ref" href="#clement2012">Clement 2012</a>], as well as the fact that institutional bodies
                        can facilitate or preclude interdisciplinary practices for certain fields
                        over others, including collaborations between engineering and computer
                        science over collaborations with those same fields and the humanities [<a class="ref" href="#clement2011">Clement 2011</a>]. Further, Patrik Svensson highlights real
                        concerns for the humanities about infrastructure that is developed within
                        existing infrastructural models (such as the library, museum, or archival
                        system) and scientific models that are based on heavy data use since these
                        models could reflect an uncritical bias towards the epistemic commitments of
                        those communities and a disregard for the more unmarked humanistic
                        technologies and infrastructures discussed in part by Smith above [<a class="ref" href="#svensson2011">Svensson 2011</a>].

                        the predominance of interdisciplinarity in fields with more traditional
                        humanistic methods. Such notions of inherent interdisciplinarity can be

                        an unsituated standpoint. For example, Willard McCarty imagines the digital
                        humanist as a "metadisciplinary" practitioner
                        within a "Methodological Commons of humanities
                        computing" that comprises twenty-two "disciplinary kinships" that cover the wide range of disciplines
                        from which computing application and research draw, such as cognitive

                        "the scholar" who engages in discussions that
                        are "strongly delimited by the scholar’s particular

                        [<a class="ref" href="#mccarty2005">McCarty 2005</a>, 134]; rather, she is a "migratory" or "itinerant" project participant with the "performative ability to move in and out of disciplines"
                        [<a class="ref" href="#mccarty2005">McCarty 2005</a>, 136]. In contrast to the scholar, the DH
                        practitioner can "step outside that space, so as to
                        connect the problem in question with a method, vocabulary or way of
                        thinking uncommon to that scholar’s discipline"
                        [<a class="ref" href="#mccarty2005">McCarty 2005</a>, 134]. As a result, the DH practitioner has
                        the perspective of "an outsider’s objectivity"
                        [<a class="ref" href="#mccarty2005">McCarty 2005</a>, 136], and she is consequently best

                        the situated scholar who has limited vision while the interdisciplinary DH

                        calls the all-seeing viewpoint a singular, uncritical perspective; she calls
                        it "this eye that fucks the world to make

                         [<a class="ref" href="#haraway1988">Haraway 1988</a>, 581]. Instead, Haraway proposes a feminist doctrine of objectivity that is

                        epistemologies including standpoint theory and postmodern situated

                        relations between the production of knowledge and practices of power in
                        science. Considering matters of "[o]bjectivity vs. subjectivity, the scientist as

                         [<a class="ref" href="#harding1986">Harding 1986</a>, 23], both standpoint theory and postmodern theory hold that all knowledge

                        such, they offer this <em class="emph">insistent embodiment</em> as "a rich tradition of critiquing hegemony without

                        publication in the late 19th century came with an increase in creating,
                        disseminating, and utilizing recorded knowledge and an enhanced desire for
                        new techniques such as documentation for managing the information deluge.
                        Michael Buckland notes that the early term to denote the set of management
                        techniques including collecting, standardizing, filing, classifying,
                        copying, disseminating, and preserving documents was traditionally "bibliography" but became "documentation" in the early 20th century [<a class="ref" href="#buckland1997">Buckland 1997</a>, 805]. As a result,

                        Documentation"<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e659">[4]</a> — was of the first to argue for an expanded
                        definition or identity for the document, one that expanded the notion of a
                        document to include its situated context. For Otlet, who published his
                        seminal text <cite class="title italic">Traité de documentation</cite> in
                        Brussels in 1934, documentation work comprised the act of observing and then
                        recording facts in publications in order to make these facts an "integral part of knowledge"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#otlet1990">Otlet 1990</a>, 12]. In Otlet’s definition of the document, however, he was also
                        concerned with "social facts" which were
                        groupings of documents, "the appraisal of which is valuable only in
                        proportion to the number of elements which it takes into
                        account"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#otlet1990">Otlet 1990</a>, 13]. In order to take these groupings into account, Otlet imagined "a system of cards that would allow one to make
                        networks and to add to them: the creation of a kind of artificial
                        brain by means of cards containing actual information or simply
                        notes of references"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#otlet1990">Otlet 1990</a>, 17]. Imagining a singularly subjective process for managing the cards
                        that rivaled processes as intricate and forward-looking as Vannevar Bush’s
                        Memex machine, Otlet realized that "judgments here [were] as complex as the matters
                        judged"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#otlet1990">Otlet 1990</a>, 13]. A document could either be the publication or the multiple
                        instantiations that make up the networked "social
                        fact" or the relationship between documents. Much like the
                        Barthesian <em class="term">text</em>, which is defined as "a
                        methodological field" in contrast to the <em class="term">work</em>
                        (described as "concrete, occupying a portion of
                        book-space") [<a class="ref" href="#barthes1977">Barthes 1977</a>, 157], Otlet’s
                        "social facts" are the field in which
                        evidentiary <em class="emph">facts</em> (i.e., each unique publication) participate.
                        Like genetic textual scholars, Otlet sought to document this social system
                        in which documents circulated by using separate cards for both publications
                        and the events and relationships that tied them, "thus allowing for all the manipulations of
                        classification and continuous interfiling"

                        and situated by those who participate in the system of its documentation.
                        First, like Otlet, she seeks to expand the definition of
                        <em class="emph">document</em> from fact or publication to anything that is
                        identified as or perceived as evidentiary. Arguing that the document is
                        always the result of the methods of documentation, Briet asks, "Is a star a document? Is a pebble rolled by a
                        torrent a document? Is a living animal a document? No. But the
                        photographs and the catalogues of stars, the stones in a museum of
                        mineralogy, and the animals cataloged and shown in a zoo, are

                         [<a class="ref" href="#briet1951">Briet 2006</a>, 1951]. Because the work of documentation is "a powerful means for the collectivization of

                         [<a class="ref" href="#briet1951">Briet 2006</a>, 31], Briet argues that the document is "intimately
                        tied to the life of a team of workers or scientists or scholars,"
                        and because it can participate in a multitude of "industrial, commercial, administrative, teaching activity, etc."
                        contexts, the content of documentation is necessarily "inter-documentary"

                           Criticism</cite> [1983] for understanding the social nature of textual
                        production. Both McKenzie and McGann argue for considering all aspects of a
                        text’s construction when determining its "textuality" —
                        from its production, through its transmission, to its consumption by
                        readers. In his Panizzi Lectures of 1985, McKenzie is concerned with "the roles of institutions and their complex
                        structures in affecting the forms of social discourse, past and
                        present"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#mckenzie1999">McKenzie 1999</a>, 15] and he thinks critically about these roles by identifying human roles
                        in textuality including producer (author/editor) and transmitter
                        (editor/printer/publisher) and consumer (reader/user). Like Briet’s
                        <em class="term">document</em>, the <em class="term">text </em>theorized by McKenzie and
                        McGann is always constructed by a situated context that includes the
                        invisible hands of editors, publishers, and book sellers among others.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p17">A familiarity with how text and document theories intersect is essential in
                        understanding current thinking about the manner in which texts and documents
                        are represented by information systems. More recently, Bernd Frohman
                        discusses the <em class="term">document</em> in relation to Jacques Derrida’s <em class="term">differance</em>
                        [<a class="ref" href="#derrida1982">Derrida 1982</a>] in a way that is particularly instructive for
                        thinking about the work of DH infrastructure building. Arguing that
                        documents are "different material kinds of temporally and
                        spatially situated bundles of inscriptions embedded in specific
                        kinds of cultural practices"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#frohmann2004b">Frohmann 2004b</a>, 396], Frohman asserts that the differences between social and
                        natural-scientific facts are epistemological rather than ontological: "Differences lie in problems of revealing facts," he
                        writes [<a class="ref" href="#frohmann2004">Frohmann 2004</a>, 77]. That is, Frohman argues that
                        these facts are not essentially different since each is vulnerable to the
                        fact that writing practices that are meant to reveal them or make them
                        evidentiary actually help to "obscure an item of
                        information’s 'own identity'"
                        [<a class="ref" href="#frohmann2004">Frohmann 2004</a>, 84]. In other words, what a situated
                        individual would document on one of Otlet’s cards is not representative of
                        the essential or discrete nature of the fact that these documents
                        represented that documenter’s perspective. Accordingly, Frohman asks us to
                        consider the human fault lines of Otlet’s system: "What
                        befalls the privileged order of facts when their signs are mechanically
                        manipulated at will? Anyone’s will?"
                        [<a class="ref" href="#frohmann2004">Frohmann 2004</a>, 87].

                     <div class="ptext" id="p18">Frohman notes that a Derridean notion of iterability necessarily poses a
                        problem for a system like Otlet’s order of <em class="emph">facts</em> since every

                        an infinite number of situated networks. Frohman’s perspective is much like
                        John Bryant’s who sees the textual event differently than social textual
                        theorists and the geneticists by arguing that these camps measure process
                        based on product where the work is always a "conceptual thing or actual set of things or even
                        discrete events "
                         [<a class="ref" href="#bryant2002">Bryant 2002</a>, 61]. Just as Frohman describes the state or process of documentation as
                        reflecting an "intensity" or a "force," an "energy that feeds
                        this obsessive documentation" and "the drive
                        to reveal facts"
                        [<a class="ref" href="#frohmann2004">Frohmann 2004</a>, 84], Bryant suggests that the work is a
                        "flow of energy," and that literary work is a
                        "phenomenon . . . best conceived not as a produced
                        work (oeuvre) but as work itself (travaille), the power of people and
                        culture to create a text"
                        [<a class="ref" href="#bryant2002">Bryant 2002</a>, 61]. Further, Michael Witmore argues that
                        "a text is a text because it is massively
                        addressable at different levels of scale"
                        [<a class="ref" href="#witmore2012">Witmore 2012</a>, 325], and he imagines that "a hundred years from now, the available computational
                        objects may be related to one another in new ways"
                        [<a class="ref" href="#witmore2012">Witmore 2012</a>, 326]. Texts will be defined by their

                        those Otlet imagined a century ago. As such, the text’s nature becomes its
                        addressability, which would be defined by the system in which it is stored

                        manifested in the objects we create (sometimes with clay or words or paint,
                        sometimes through identification or revelation) and choose to study, but
                        this knowledge is put into action, is made interpretable by an interaction
                        with information infrastructures or systems (such as the publication cycle,
                        the creation and use of Otlet’s cards, or the development of a database or
                        interface). Like Briet, Frohman, and Witmore, John Bryant questions, "how shall the makers of the archive facilitate and
                        delimit our ability to construct texts, editions, and
                        knowledge?"

                        resolution of uncertainty instead of with a more connotative sense of
                        knowledge. Indeed, the revolutionary aspect of Claude E. Shannon’s 1948
                        piece "A Mathematical Theory of Communication,"
                        which is often considered the beginnings of information theory, was that he

                         [<a class="ref" href="#shannon1971">Shannon 1971</a>, 31]. Shannon defined <em class="term">information</em> as a function of the degree

                        receiving end and that message is compared against the intended message from
                        the information source [<a class="ref" href="#shannon1971">Shannon 1971</a>, 31]. To explain
                        very briefly, in Shannon’s test scenario, the information source (e.g., the
                        writer or the speaker) produces a message, which a transmitter encodes into
                        a signal for transmission over the channel; the receiver then decodes the
                        signals, thereby "reconstructing the message" for
                        the "destination" or "the person (or thing) for whom the message was
                        intended"

                        Interdisciplinarity is most useful when it becomes a technology that affords
                        our ability to better situate ourselves: to see how we see, from where we
                        see, who is interpreting the field (and who is not), the limits to our
                        vision, and what we see when what we see is situated in relation to other
                        visions. Frederic Jameson reminds us that "all truths are at best momentary, situational, and
                        marked by a history in the process of change and
                        transformation"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#jameson2009">Jameson 2009</a>, 403]. A feminist perspective encourages us to responsibly embrace that
                        portion of reality that concerns us (to situate ourselves) even as we change
                        and transform with the realization that (a) we cannot step outside of our
                        perspective, and (b) in the attempt to do so, we step outside the mode of
                        intellectual rigor needed to influence our position as subject and agent.

                        designing and building tools gives one an indispensable knowledge of its
                        processes and whether or not women and people of color (and others) are
                        precluded from these activities for a variety of very real and very situated
                        reasons. In this sense, the rhetoric of "mastery"
                        over technology can be intellectually prohibitive since it threatens an
                        advancement of knowledge production from other perspectives. Indeed, in
                        McCarty’s paradigm, the unsituated DH practitioner is "liberate[d] from the censure of difficulty and so

                        some extent aware of itself as a technology," Richard Poirier
                        writes. "But literary modernism thrusts this awareness upon
                        us and to an unprecedented degree asks us to experience the enormous

                        unproblematized reference, linearity, decodable meaning," that

                        feel liberated from the imperative toward mastery implicit in the

                        [<a class="ref" href="#simpson2000">Simpson 2000</a>, 46]. Stein replaces these with what
                        DeKoven describes as "anti-patriarchal" modes
                        that are "incoherent, open-ended, anarchic, irreducibly
                        multiple, and focused on what Barthes calls 'the

                        female poet whose work seemed to embody a defiance for mastery. Her
                        biographer Irene Gammel places much emphasis on Freytag-Loringhoven’s
                        ability to put herself "in control" by "putting her spectators at a distance," which is
                        accomplished by the manner in which she "deflates the
                        potential eroticism" of her nude performances "through humorous costuming: vegetables adorn her
                        body; stamps decorate her painted face; her hair is shaved and head

                        had an equally disarming effect. William Carlos Williams once wrote: "Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven came to me as

                        documentary practices are fundamentally (1) material; (2) institutionalized;
                        (3) dependent on socializations such as "training,

                        Freytag-Loringhoven. This "complex" poem is a cluster of
                        works (one text in the Barthesian sense) that includes thirty-three versions
                        of a poem in two languages by Freytag Loringhoven. The entire cluster can be
                        dated between 1923 and 1924 when the poet had just returned to Berlin after
                        twelve years in the United States. About one third of the poems are in
                        German and tend to be composed in a more traditional form and style. Two
                        thirds are in English. As this versioned edition shows, Freytag Loringhoven
                        did not simply translate this poem. She rewrote her poem over time using the
                        two languages to embody adaptations or re-creations that reflected her
                        changing geography, economic status, love experiences, and poetic

                        was a published poet, a street performer, and an artist. She published in

                        Freytag-Loringhoven was a significant element of what she considered her
                        naturalized identity. As a result, language functions as an essential aspect
                        of provocation within her Dadaist project — she used linguistic codes as
                        experimental tools for play. Understanding her lived presence and the
                        posthumous literary productions surrounding that presence has become an
                        important aspect of understanding her poetry, her performances, and her
                        impact on literary studies. Given the material of this poem, however, an
                        information infrastructure that facilitates access to the element of
                        language play that Williams identifies provides for a variety of plausible
                        perspectives.

                        primary goal in providing access to her poetic work. To this end, I encoded
                        the XML file using the parallel segmentation and location-referenced
                        encoding described in the P5 Guidelines in order to make explicit our

                        represented in the thirty-three versions of the text (which manifest across
                        twenty-two, full color, documentary images of the manuscript pages).<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e1467">[11]</a> We encoded the transcriptions with

                        what effect. For example, notwithstanding its virtues, encoding with a
                        standard such as the TEI can be extremely frustrating for editors attempting
                        to realize abstract texts. As McGann points out, the TEI has adopted "a markup practice — a linguistic and paper-based approach
                        — that is at odds with the theoretical opportunities that have been
                        opened up by electronic textuality, where the limits of the codex are
                        surpassed"; this frustration, he and others complain, results
                        from the TEI incorporating hierarchies that "misimagine the relation of electronic to
                        paper-based textuality"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#mcgann1996">McGann 1996</a>]. For better or worse, these hierarchies represent the artifacts of
                        working with computational models. On the other hand, other opportunities
                        for new knowledge are possible with TEI encoding.

                        poems in twelve versions ("Erstling" and "Erste Lieb"), we show that Freytag-Loringhoven also
                        develops two branches of English poems ("Firstling" and "First Love") in this
                        edition.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e1539">[13]</a>
                        An example of the predominant "Erstling/Firstling" variants appear together in versions 3.1 and
                        3.2, while the other strain of variants evolve from "Erste Liebe/First Love" into the less well represented "He" poems, making the The Firstling/Erstling/He
                        Complex of the title. In particular, the works in this edition show that
                        Freytag-Loringhoven used translation as a technique to express her
                        perspectives (and to play with these expressions) on both German and
                        American cultures and languages. Note 5.3 verso explains
                        Freytag-Loringhoven’s perspective on at least one evolving theme:
                        Freytag-Loringhoven tells Djuna Barnes (to whom she has sent this poem in a
                        letter) that the German "Erstling" (3.1) was
                        "touching and naiv [sic]," and the English
                        "Firstling" (3.2) "bitter
                        and grim." Further, the puns Freytag-Loringhoven derives from the
                        name of her supposed once-lover Ernst Hardt (1876-1947) provide for one
                        example of the sense of cross-language play in the poems. Titles such as
                        "Firstling" (version 1.1), "First Love" (version 8.3), "First Born" (version 9.5), "Erstling"
                        (version 3.1), "He" (version 4.2), and "Liebe" (version 10), indicate that the poems are
                        referring to this first love (three versions of which are shown in Figure 1.
                        The English versions 8.3 and 11, have the title "First
                        Love" for "He," but the first part of
                        the word "Erste" (or "First" in German) is
                        also "Er" or "He" in English. Inserting an
                        "n" after "Er" results in "Ernste
                        Lieb" or "Serious Love," which
                        contains Hardt's given name "Ernst" and corresponds to the basic,
                        non-inflected form of the German adjective "ernst" or "earnest."
                        The playful use of the word "wart" as an image for "heart" is
                        another example of translating feelings with translating words as
                        Freytag-Loringhoven indicates in her note to Barnes on version 1.3: "'He' and 'Firstling,'" she writes, "These
                        two poems are same. I leave it to you – if you will print both? With
                        that 'Flayed Heart -/Froze - - - -.' I
                        consider it singular strong enough – to countenance the shriveling of
                        the heart to the semblance and useless appendix of the heart."

                        "shifting vantage points" which elucidate

                        "document" in projects such as the BECHAMEL XML
                        Semantics Project. Renear and Dubin seek to theorize the "identity,"
                        "criteria," or "individuation" conditions of documents as a "method for determining whether an object x and an
                        object y are the same object"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#renear2003">Renear 2003</a>, 1]. Such differentiation in an information system is key for identifying
                        and reidentifying, counting, and distinguishing entities. Their specific,
                        situated, readerly motivations similarly affect their definitions: "by document," the authors write, "then we refer to the abstract symbolic expression
                        which may be physically instantiated repeatedly and in various
                        media. This use corresponds more or less to the FRBR term 'expression' [17] and has
                        the colloquial
                        synonym 'text'"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#renear2003">Renear 2003</a>, 1]. Their goal is to allow for a way to conceptualize overlapping
                        elements, to move away from the representation of text as structure to the
                        representation of text as concept, a movement toward further abstraction.
                        The authors write, "data structures don’t have <em class="emph">paragraphs</em>,
                        they have nodes labeled 'p'; documents don’t have nodes labeled
                        'p', they have <em class="emph">paragraphs</em>"

                        digital humanities work is not, as some have argued, the lack of
                        self-consciousness critiques about the humanities that have long been the
                        purview of the humanities, but rather the lack of self-conscious critiques
                        about the information infrastructure that affords these critiques. Christine
                        Borgmann, among others, calls for "a social studies of
                        the digital humanities"; she asks, "Why is no
                        one following digital humanities scholars around to understand their
                        practices, in the way that scientists have been studied for the last
                        several decades?"
                        [<a class="ref" href="#borgman2009">Borgman 2009</a>]. More recently, Don Waters invoked this divide
                        between practices in the sciences and the humanities by discussing a piece
                        by Steve Nichols entitled "The Anxiety of Irrelevance:
                        Digital Humanities and Contemporary Literary Theory" [2013] in
                        which Nichols, in turn, seems to recapitulate C.P. Snow’s "two cultures" argument [1959]. Nichols argues that
                        while engineers and computer scientists ask "<em class="emph">How</em> possible" questions (or "investigations that seek to describe, explain, control, or
                        predict material things"), humanists ask inherently divergent
                        "<em class="emph">Why</em> possible" questions based
                        on critical intelligences [<a class="ref" href="#nichols2013">Nichols 2013</a>, 9]. These
                        critical intelligences entail "distinguishing what is 'real' or
                        'given' from what our process of thinking
                        about the object contributes to our cognition of the thing"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#nichols2013">Nichols 2013</a>, 6]. In short, or, in the words of Waters (who is, in turn, paraphrasing
                        Nichols), critical intelligence comprises an emphasis on "objects of study in the humanities [that] are
                        characterized by 'contingency' and
                        'irony' rather than truth or falsity"

                        <em class="emph">Why</em> questions are incompatible, Waters (like Borgman) uses
                        Nichols’s argument to encourage more crossover between the sciences and the
                        humanities in order to better understand "the disciplined methods and tools associated with
                        the application of critical intelligence in various kinds of

                        opportunities for critical work are foreshortened when the value of DH is

                        theoretical suppositions, rather than DH’s potential to help question these
                        regimes of theory. As McCarty has argued, "all
                        meaningful uses of computing are heuristic, and therefore that mere

                        historically been an important funding resource for supporting a generation
                        of new DH tools and method to include developing new technologies of
                        self-consciousness including "scholarship that focuses on the history, criticism,

                        facilitated by systems. I have demonstrated how grounding digital humanities
                        in work being discussed within information studies affords a perspective
                        that allows us to see that information systems are themselves situated
                        within ways of practice that shape our understanding of the plausibility of
                        certain interpretative standpoints – regardless of whether or not the

                        focus on self-conscious method reflects an unproductive tendency to view
                        digital humanities as a partial fix for an epistemological and ontological
                        stasis in the humanities. For Julia Flanders, this tendency is "confusing: it is vague, utopian, and
                        self-contradictory . . . The rhetoric of digital changes exists, for
                        the academy, as a way of producing a new narrative of progress which
                        generates research, and a rhetoric of transformation that can carry
                        the self-critique that is built into academic life"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#flanders2009">Flanders 2009</a>, 125–126]. In other words, while measuring a research method’s value by how
                        well it facilitates our ability to think critically about our own
                        interpretations is valuable, this focus seems positioned for the sake of

                        self-critique. A feminist standpoint reminds us that while it is not enough
                        to say that DH should employ self-conscious methods, it is equally
                        insufficient to merely be self-conscious about methods, even when this work

                        how meanings and bodies get made, not in order to deny meanings and
                        bodies, but in order to build meanings and bodies that have a chance
                        for life"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#haraway1988">Haraway 1988</a>, 580]. Using feminist inquiry to understand the nature of information
                        science questions within digital humanities helps us to articulate how we
                        might fulfill our responsibility to become answerable to how information
                        infrastructure impacts meaning-making in the humanities as well as action in
                        the digital humanities.
