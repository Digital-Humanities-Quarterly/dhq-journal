                     Fragments in Time: Art, Culture, and Exchange across Medieval Saharan Africa, an

                     lead curator of Caravans of Gold led a seminar in which the students were tasked with
                     developing content for a digital version of the multilingual exhibit as a class project.
                     The goals of the digital exhibit were twofold: (1) provide undergraduate students
                     with
                     an opportunity to make curatorial decisions in a real-world context and (2) develop
                     a
                     digital museum experience for people in Mali, Morocco, and Nigeria. Northwestern
                     University Libraries partnered with the Block Museum to develop and maintain the exhibit

                  <div class="ptext" id="p18">Large images consume high amounts of network data and make websites slow to load.
                     <cite class="title italic">Caravans of Gold</cite> contains over two hundred images but we wanted to
                     keep the exhibit as small as possible by using a minimal number of image files, and
                     smaller file sizes, to ensure quick load times on any device. Meeting this goal
                     prevented us from using some of the image processing features of Wax
                     (wax:derivatives).</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p19">19</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p19">The wax:derivatives automation script is intended to process images for use on the
                     web.
                     There are two options for running the script called “simple” and “IIIF”. The simple
                     option uses an image to create two derivates: (1) a small, thumbnail version and (2)
                     a
                     full, resized version. The IIIF option, named after the International Image
                     Interoperability Framework (IIIF), processes the images according a technical
                     specification for making high-resolution images reusable by scholars and institutions.
                     IIIF is typically used with image repository systems. It works by serving an image
                     as
                     many small image “tiles” that, all together, comprise the full image, allowing users to
                     zoom, annotate, and manipulate the images for a variety of scholarly purposes. Both
                     of
                     these options generate more image files of larger file sizes than we need. One of
                     the
                     primary goals of PWAs is to lessen the hardware and network requirements for users
                     of
                     websites, and large images would make <cite class="title italic">Caravans of Gold</cite> require

                  <div class="ptext" id="p20">Instead, we resorted to compressing and resizing each image individually.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e404">[6]</a> We would not recommend this approach if it can
                     be avoided. The original <cite class="title italic">Caravans of Gold</cite> images varied in size,
                     quality, and format. We needed to work with each image individually in order to crop,
                     resize and reformat it in preparation for use with the project. It is generally a
                     best
                     practice to serve images that are appropriately sized to fit the screens upon which
                     they
                     will display. For the majority of our images, we created one size for desktop screens
                     (between 600px and 800px in width) and one size for mobile screens (300px in width).
                     We
                     used HTML markup to help browsers select the appropriate image based on the width
                     of the

                     into French and Arabic, the official languages of Mali and Morocco respectively. The
                     goal was to enable all of the international lending institutions to promote the exhibit
                     to their patrons, rather than exclusively publishing the exhibit in English. </div>

                     generating website content from a spreadsheet, but this only works on monolingual
                     websites. Working with translations required us to use external tools to help generate
                     the website in multiple languages. To handle the Arabic and French translations, we
                     needed the Jekyll Multiple Languages plugin [<a class="ref" href="#kurtson">Kurtson</a>], which creates standalone websites
                     for each language.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e431">[8]</a> The plugin stores all of the translations in YAML files, which are plain text

                  <div class="ptext" id="p23">You can think of the YAML file as a database of definitions, where each word or phrase
                     (the key) has a definition in either English, French, or Arabic (the value). For
                     example, the English definition of the title of the website is represented as “title:
                     Caravans of Gold” in the YAML file. Every word and sentence in the English, French, and
                     Arabic versions of the website needed to be represented as an entry in a YAML file.
                     This
                     meant that we had to copy and paste text from Microsoft Word documents (.docx files)
