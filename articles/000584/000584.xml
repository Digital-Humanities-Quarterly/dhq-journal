         <head>INTRODUCTION</head>
         <p>In 2019, the Block Museum of Art at Northwestern University presented <title rend="italic">Caravans of Gold,
            Fragments in Time: Art, Culture, and Exchange across Medieval Saharan Africa</title>, an
            exhibition of collection items representing trade and cultural exchange across the
            Saharan desert from the 8th to 16th centuries <ptr target="#berzock2019"/>. That spring, the
            lead curator of <title rend="italic">Caravans of Gold</title> led a seminar in which the students were tasked with
            developing content for a digital version of the multilingual exhibit as a class project.
            The goals of the digital exhibit were twofold: (1) provide undergraduate students with
            an opportunity to make curatorial decisions in a real-world context and (2) develop a
            digital museum experience for people in Mali, Morocco, and Nigeria. Northwestern
            University Libraries partnered with the Block Museum to develop and maintain the exhibit
               website.<note> The final exhibit website is available at <ref
                  target="https://caravans.library.northwestern.edu/"
                  >https://caravans.library.northwestern.edu/</ref>. The source code for the final
               website is available at <ref target="https://github.com/nulib/caravans-wax"
                  >https://github.com/nulib/caravans-wax</ref>.</note>
         </p></div>
         <div>
         <head>PROJECT PLANNING</head>
         <p>More than half of all global internet traffic is generated from a mobile device. In
            African countries, mobile internet traffic accounts for two-thirds of all web page
            visits <ptr target="#statista2021"/>. In terms of network speeds, Morocco is about even with the
            global average; however, mobile data in Nigeria and Mali is downloaded at half the speed
            of the global average <ptr target="#speedtesta"/> <ptr target="#speedtestb"/> <ptr target="#gsma"/>. This was echoed
            anecdotally from our museum partners,<note> The list of lending institutions is available
               at <ref target="https://caravans.library.northwestern.edu/about/"
                  >https://caravans.library.northwestern.edu/about/</ref>. </note> who requested a
            mobile app, rather than a traditional website, for the digital exhibit.</p>
         <p>Traditional mobile apps are developed for the operating system on which they are
            intended to be installed. Android is the most popular operating system in Mali, Morocco,
            and Nigeria; however, iOS is also used in Nigeria and Morocco, with between 7% and 19%
            of mobile market share respectively <ptr target="#mobile"/>.
            Unfortunately, the same native mobile app cannot run on both Android and iOS devices; thus, we would need to develop two mobile apps with identical features. </p></div>
         <div>
         <head>WHAT DO WE REALLY NEED?</head>
         <p>Given this scope, it was useful to unpack the initial request to develop <q>a mobile app</q>
            for <title rend="italic">Caravans of Gold</title>. Northwestern University Libraries does not
            develop mobile apps. We develop static websites for various forms of scholarly and
            educational materials and deposit archival copies in an institutional repository. Static
            websites help keep our costs down while giving us the flexibility to produce
            customizable, modern, secure, and content-rich websites for students and scholars. </p>
            <p>It is here that the central question of minimal computing — <quote rend="inline">What do we need?</quote> — saved this
            project idea from being rejected outright <ptr target="#gil2016"/>. These were the core
            requirements:</p>
         <list type="unordered">
            <item>Designed for mobile devices;</item>
            <item>Performant on low-bandwidth networks;</item>
            <item>Installable on mobile phones, leaving an app icon on the device;</item>
            <item>Usable while not connected to the internet; and</item>
            <item>Maintainable for at least 10 years.</item>
         </list>
         <p>It turns out that we did not need the complex capabilities of traditional mobile apps,
            such as user accounts, access to the device’s file system, control of the camera or
            microphone, or push notifications. What we needed was a static website with Progressive
            Web App (PWA) features.</p>
         <p>Fortunately, the planning phase for <title rend="italic">Caravans of Gold</title> happened to
            coincide with early news of Wax, <quote rend="inline">a minimal computing project for producing digital
               exhibitions focused on longevity, low costs, and flexibility</quote> <ptr target="#nyrop"/>. Wax is an
            open source framework for the Jekyll static-site generator that contains a website theme
            and a set of automations that can be used to make a static website from a folder of
            images and a spreadsheet of item metadata. Wax made it easy for us to get started, and
            its connection to minimal computing generated learning opportunities for the libraries,
            the museum, and the students.</p>
         <p>As a class project, the students assumed the role of museum curators by selecting
            images, writing texts, and working with a librarian to make a digital exhibit app.
            During the quarter, we spent a class period discussing the basics of minimal computing
            and the process for using Wax to build the exhibit. At the end of the term, the students
            assembled a folder containing photographic images of museum exhibit items, a spreadsheet
            of metadata about the items, a text document with some background, and contextual
            information for the website pages. </p></div>
         <div>
         <head>PROGRESSIVE WEB APPS (PWAs)</head>
         <p>PWAs provide the option for an app to be installed on a device for quick access and
            offline use. Unlike traditional mobile apps, PWAs can be written in standard HTML, CSS,
            and JavaScript. There is no formal specification, nor is there a canonical package,
            library, or framework. PWAs simply denote websites that meet the following criteria:</p>
         <list type="unordered">
            <item>The website uses responsive design to fit any screen size;</item>
            <item>The website is served over an HTTPS network;</item>
            <item>The website includes a service worker to intercept and respond to network
               requests; and </item>
            <item>The website includes a web app manifest file to allow devices to install it (MDN
               Contributors).</item>
         </list>
         <p>Wax produces a responsive website that fits any screen. The HTTPS requirement is a
            feature provided by the web hosting service (in our case, Amazon Web Services). The web
            app manifest and service worker files needed to be added to the website we built with
            Wax and the Jekyll Multiple Languages plugin. </p>
         <p>A web app manifest is a JSON file that includes information related to how an
            application can be installed to a device <ptr target="#mdn"/>. A typical web app
            manifest includes the full name of the application; a short name of the application; a
            list of app icon paths in various sizes for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens; a
            background color; a display setting; and a URL for the app landing page. We provide
            three web app manifests, one for each language in the exhibit. </p>
         <p>A service worker is a JavaScript file that acts as a network proxy to respond to HTTP
            requests, such as navigating from one web page to another <ptr target="#gaunt2019"/>. These files
            eliminate unnecessary network calls and enable the digital exhibit to be usable while
            the device is offline.<note> We used Google’s <ref
                  target="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox">Workbox</ref> software to
               create our service worker.</note> We used a service worker to precache all HTML, CSS,
            and JavaScript files for the English, French, and Arabic versions of the website and
            cache only the images that are loaded to the screen. </p>
         <p>PWAs are an example of minimal computing concepts put into practice. Alex Russell
            distinguishes between PWAs and other web applications by their adherence to a set of
            foundational principles:</p>
         <list type="unordered">
            <item>URLs and links as the core organizing system: if you can't link to it, it isn't
               part of the web;</item>
            <item>Markup and styling for accessibility, both to humans and search engines;</item>
            <item>UI richness and system capabilities provided as additions to a functional core;
               and</item>
            <item>Free to implement without permission or payment, which in practice means
               standards-based. <ptr target="#russell2015"/></item>
         </list>
         <p>Put into practice, these principles resemble Jentery Sayers’s definitions of <q>minimal</q>
            and <q>maximal</q> forms of computing: maximum access, maximum accessibility, minimal
            connectivity, and minimal vulnerabilities <ptr target="#sayers2016"/>. Native desktop and mobile
            apps, by contrast, betray these principles with proprietary packaging, installation
            requirements, and permissions-based distribution through app stores. </p>
         <p>By side-stepping the app-store infrastructure, PWA evangelists seem to espouse similar
            values that we hear from the open access movement <ptr target="#chan2002"/>. In both cases,
            there is a desire to emphasize the basic technologies of the web in order to facilitate
            the free distribution of information. While the popularity of PWAs is indeed driven by
            commercial interests, the use of services workers and web asset bundling tools for
            academic web publications can make the renewal, dissemination, and preservation of the
            scholarly record easier. </p></div>
         <div>
         <head>SPEED AND PERFORMANCE</head>
         <p>Websites that are slow to render are more difficult and frustrating to use, so we made
            it a priority to ensure fast page load times for <title rend="italic">Caravans of Gold</title> users
            in Mali, Morocco, and Nigeria. Performance testing measures the speed at which the
            content of the website is loaded and displayed on a variety of user devices and
            networks. This is a key requirement to the PWA development process. Our primary tool for
            measuring performance is Google’s Lighthouse
            performance audits. Lighthouse provides evaluations in several categories: performance,
            accessibility, best practices, search engine optimization, and PWA. Lighthouse will
            simulate a desktop or mobile device and load the web page you select, assessing any one
            of those areas on a scale of 0-100. We made the following improvements as a result of
            the performance testing:</p>
         <list type="unordered">
            <item>Deploy the website files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) with GZIP compression<note> We
                  used the <ref target="https://github.com/laurilehmijoki/s3_website"
                     >s3_website</ref> Ruby gem to manage deployments to our Amazon Web Services
                  hosting.</note> and
            </item>
            <item>Use tree shaking to analyze and remove unused CSS code<note> We used <ref
                     target="https://purgecss.com/">PurgeCSS</ref>, but tools like <ref
                     target="https://webpack.js.org/">Webpack</ref> and <ref
                     target="https://parceljs.org/">Parcel</ref> are also very popular.</note>
            </item>
         </list>
         <p>These tests and improvements provide some assurances that any visitors in Mali, Morocco,
            and Nigeria will have a good user experience while accessing the exhibit.</p></div>
         <div>
         <head>THE PROBLEM WITH IMAGES</head>
         <p>Large images consume high amounts of network data and make websites slow to load. <title
               rend="italic">Caravans of Gold</title> contains over two hundred images but we wanted to
            keep the exhibit as small as possible by using a minimal number of image files and
            smaller file sizes, to ensure quick load times on any device. Meeting this goal
            prevented us from using some of the image processing features of Wax
            (<code>wax:derivatives</code>).</p>
         <p>The <code>wax:derivatives</code> automation script is intended to process images for use on the web.
            There are two options for running the script called <q>simple</q> and <q>IIIF.</q> The simple
            option uses an image to create two derivates: (1) a small, thumbnail version and (2) a
            full, resized version. The IIIF option, named after the International Image
            Interoperability Framework (IIIF), processes the images according a technical
            specification for making high-resolution images reusable by scholars and institutions.
            IIIF is typically used with image repository systems. It works by serving an image as
            many small image <q>tiles</q> that, all together, comprise the full image, allowing users to
            zoom, annotate, and manipulate the images for a variety of scholarly purposes. Both of
            these options generate more image files of larger file sizes than we need. One of the
            primary goals of PWAs is to lessen the hardware and network requirements for users of
            websites, and large images would require <title rend="italic">Caravans of Gold</title> 
            users to have more device storage and network data access than is necessary.</p>
         <p>Instead, we resorted to compressing and resizing each image individually.<note> After we
               correctly sized and cropped images, we used the public TinyJPG and TinyPNG web
               services for the compression.</note> We would not recommend this approach if it can
            be avoided. The original <title rend="italic">Caravans of Gold</title> images varied in size,
            quality, and format. We needed to work with each image individually in order to crop, resize and reformat it in preparation for use with the project. It is generally a best
            practice to serve images that are appropriately sized to fit the screens upon which they
            will display. For the majority of our images, we created one size for desktop screens
            (between 600px and 800px in width) and one size for mobile screens (300px in width). We
            used HTML markup to help browsers select the appropriate image based on the width of the
               screen.<note> The srcset attribute for the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element provides the browser
                  with both large and small options for the same image <ptr target="#coyier2014"/>.</note>
         </p></div>
         <div>
         <head>TRANSLATIONS</head>
         <p>Because <title rend="italic">Caravans of Gold</title> features items that are loaned by museums in Mali, Morocco, and
            Nigeria, the Block Museum commissioned the translation of the English-language content
            into French and Arabic, the official languages of Mali and Morocco respectively. The
            goal was to enable all of the international lending institutions to promote the exhibit
            to their patrons, rather than exclusively publishing the exhibit in English. </p>
         <p>Wax does not support multi-language websites. Wax provides an automated workflow for
            generating website content from a spreadsheet, but this only works on monolingual
            websites. Working with translations required us to use external tools to help generate
            the website in multiple languages. To handle the Arabic and French translations, we
            needed the Jekyll Multiple Languages plugin <ptr target="#kurtson"/>, which creates standalone websites
            for each language.<note> For example, the French-language exhibit is written to a
               directory called <q>fr</q> and deployed to <ref
                  target="https://caravans.library.northwestern.edu/fr/"
                  >https://caravans.library.northwestern.edu/fr/.</ref>
            </note> The plugin stores all of the translations in YAML files, which are plain text
            files containing key-value pairs (for example, <q><code>title: Caravans of Gold</code></q>). </p>
         <p>You can think of the YAML file as a database of definitions, where each word or phrase
            (the key) has a definition in either English, French, or Arabic (the value). For
            example, the English definition of the title of the website is represented as <q><code>title:
            Caravans of Gold</code></q> in the YAML file. Every word and sentence in the English, French, and
            Arabic versions of the website needed to be represented as an entry in a YAML file. This
            meant that we had to copy and paste text from Microsoft Word documents (.docx files)
            that were provided by the translators. </p>
         <p>While the plugin allows us to build a website in three languages from a single codebase,
            we learned that it did not support right-to-left languages, like Arabic, without
            customizing the layouts. We had to significantly alter the HTML layouts in order to
            render an adequate right-to-left reading experience for the Arabic version of the
            exhibit. We did this in two ways: adding a <code>dir="rtl"</code> attribute to HTML elements and
            using CSS rules to right-justify the text <ptr target="#ishida2016"/>. </p> </div>
         <div>
         <head>GUIDED TOURS</head>
         <p>We designed <title rend="italic">Caravans of Gold</title> to provide three methods of
            navigation: browsing, searching, and touring. The Wax theme organizes the exhibit items
            for browsing and searching by providing a gallery view of the collection as well as a
            search interface, but we also wanted to simulate a guided tour experience for visitors
            interested in reading a narrative behind the works, history, and locations featured
            throughout. </p>
         <p>The exhibit is essentially organized into thirteen tours representing locations along a
            major Saharan trade route and points in time during the medieval period. Each tour
            features several key works and important context about the work’s history, relevance,
            and excavation. When a user clicks into one of the tours, they are launched into a
            full-screen slide deck presentation.<note> We used the <ref
                  target="https://revealjs.com/">RevealJS</ref> slide deck presentation framework
               for HTML to create custom <ref target="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/layouts/">Jekyll
                  Layouts</ref> to supplement the templates <ref
                  target="https://minicomp.github.io/wax/">Wax</ref> provides.</note> Each tour is a
            single HTML file controlled by JavaScript to manage advancing through the slides. This
            was the final content piece we added to the exhibit. </p></div>

         <head>CONCLUSION</head>
         <p>The average internet user in the Global North has a faster network connection and more
            powerful internet device than the average internet user in the Global South. Static
            websites and PWAs provide technical solutions for addressing these global inequities in
            user experience by minimizing load times, file sizes, and network requests. Static
            website frameworks, like Wax, can be extended to include PWA features in order to
            improve the access and usability of digital content to people in the Global South.
            <title rend="italic">Caravans of Gold</title> combines minimal computing with PWA technologies to successfully
            produce a multilingual digital exhibit app optimized for people around the world. </p></div>
