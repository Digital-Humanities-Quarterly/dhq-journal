                  <p>This paper describes the experience of a group of interdisciplinary researchers and
                     research professionals involved in the PROgressive VIsual DEcision-making in Digital
                     Humanities (PROVIDEDH) project, a four-year project funded within the CHIST-ERA call
                     2016 for the topic “Visual Analytics for Decision Making under
                     Uncertainty — VADMU”. It contributes to the academic literature on how
                     digital methods can enhance interdisciplinary cooperative work by exploring the
                     collaboration involved in developing visualisations to lead decision-making in
                     historical research in a specific interdisciplinary research setting. More
                     specifically, we discuss how the cross-disciplinary design of a taxonomy of sources
                     of uncertainty in Digital Humanities (DH), a “profoundly
                     collaborative enterprise” built at the intersection of computer science and
                     humanities research, became not just an instrument to organise data, but also a tool
                     to negotiate and build compromises between different communities of practice.</p>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">Increasingly, research policy-makers and funders are calling for inter- and
                     transdisciplinary approaches to be applied in response to complex socio-scientific
                     questions. Whilst the most exciting and ground-breaking innovations, to paraphrase
                     Carlos Moedas, former European Commissioner for Research, Science and Innovation,
                     may
                     indeed be happening at the intersection of disciplines, this kind of
                     cross-disciplinary collaboration poses many challenges, among which are the
                     individual disciplinary values, concepts of proof and evidence, languages, technical
                     cultures and methodologies employed by different domains (<span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#bruce_etal2004">#bruce_etal2004</a></span>; [<a class="ref" href="#lowe_ecology_2009">Lowe, Whitman, and Phillipson 2009</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#edmond_deliverable_2018">Edmond et al. 2018</a>]). It is perhaps unsurprising that overcoming
                     the challenges associated with specialised terminology/vocabulary is often
                     instrumental to the success of cooperative work involving individuals of different
                     disciplinary backgrounds and expertise levels ([<a class="ref" href="#skeels_revealing_2008">Skeels et al. 2008</a>]; <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#bruce_etal2004">#bruce_etal2004</a></span>). This may be, in particular, the case when the
                     goal of the cooperation is to build a software platform, within and behind which
                     mutual misunderstandings can become encoded, creating dissonances in structure and
                     function, and potentially leading to difficulties for future users. This paper
                     contributes to the academic literature on how a specific kind of technical artifact
                     –
                     in this case, a taxonomy of uncertainty – was used to enhance the functionality of
                     a
                     technical team and their co-developed platform itself created for the purpose of
                     supporting interdisciplinary cooperative work. More specifically, we discuss how the
                     cross-disciplinary design of this taxonomy became not just an instrument to organise
                     data, but also a tool to negotiate and build compromises between four different
                     communities of practice, each of which came to the project with a very different
                     epistemically ‘native’ approach to issues of uncertainty. In order to illustrate the
                     many interlinked functions, the taxonomy was required to perform, we will briefly
                     introduce the project, its aims, and the four diverse but complementary partners that
                     came together to deliver it. We will then discuss the taxonomy itself, how it needed
                     to be adapted from earlier, similar work, and some of the issues it allowed the
                     project team to negotiate and discuss. In the final section, we will look at the
                     application of the taxonomy and how it informs system function in a manner that is
                     sensitive to the requirements of all of the disciplinary stakeholders in the
                     project.</div>

                     collaborative platform for the visual analysis of uncertainty in the Digital
                     Humanities (DH) data analysis pipeline (discussed in further detail below). The
                     consortium can be described as both complex and nonroutine [<a class="ref" href="#strauss_articulation_1988">Strauss 1988</a>], comprising a multinational team of four
                     institutional partners and two overlapping sub-teams (composed of the two technical
                     partners and two partners representing the arts and humanities). Further, the
                     individual partner teams combine researchers and engineers of varying levels of
                     expertise in specific branches of computer science and humanities disciplines as well
                     as in open innovation and DH.</div>

                     computer science as a discipline. The coordinator, based in the Visual Analytics and
                     Information Visualisation Research Group (VisUsal) at the University of Salamanca
                     (USAL), brought expertise in visual analytics, research methods, software
                     engineering, and human-computer interaction (HCI). In addition to the project
                     coordination activities, USAL led both the development of user interfaces and
                     evaluation and the research for the definition and management of uncertainty in DH.
                     The second technical partner, the Poznan Supercomputing and Networking Center (PSNC),
                     brought extensive experience designing and building large-scale DH infrastructures,
                     and led the development of the PROVIDEDH platform. Considering its intended user
                     base, however, the technological expertise of USAL and PSNC alone would not have been
                     sufficient to realise the PROVIDEDH platform. Realising the principle “that [Digital Humanities] tool builders must consider themselves as
                     entering into a social contract with tool users”

                     of Digital Humanities and Open Innovation Science respectively, and led research
                     regarding user needs, user engagement, and exploitation and dissemination of

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">One of PROVIDEDH’s first objectives was to define and describe the key types of
                     uncertainty in DH research datasets. To date, various definitions, classifications
                     and taxonomies of uncertainty have been proposed, but much of this work on the
                     characterisation of uncertainty has been delivered within isolated domains. As Kouw
                     et al. (2012) argue, typologies of this kind are valuable tools in the attempt to
                     determine the extent to which uncertainties can in fact be explained. Perhaps more
                     importantly from the perspective of PROVIDEDH is the authors’ assertion that new
                     forms of knowledge production that challenge our understanding of uncertainty “almost always occur at the boundaries between different
                     disciplines.”</div>

                     which addressed the challenge of improving inter- and transdisciplinary cooperation
                     between Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences (AHSS) and Science, Technology,
                     Engineering, Mathematics, and Medicine (STEMM) disciplines, identified 25 factors

                     primary challenges faced by the PROVIDEDH team relates to what Vienni and Baptista
                     (among others) describe as the “Communicative” factor, which refers to the
                     different “languages” employed by different disciplines ([<a class="ref" href="#lowe_ecology_2009">Lowe, Whitman, and Phillipson 2009</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#boix_mansilla_shared_2016">Boix Mansilla, Lamont, and Sato 2016</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#vienni_baptista_final_2020">Vienni Baptista et al. 2020</a>]). The absence of a common transdisciplinary
                     language/terminology to discuss shared concepts such as uncertainty can substantially
                     hinder interdisciplinary research and, conversely, processes to resolve this gap are
                     exceptionally useful for illustrating how the development of shared intellectual

                     a
                     series of interviews conducted with computer scientists, the project team found the
                     trend “point[ing ]towards an epistemic cultural bias towards
                     viewing data, whatever it is, as broadly encompassing, and in terms of its

                     in
                     which the precise context, in which a word is used, can determine its intended
                     meaning in a way that might be opaque to outsiders. Needless to say, if the
                     possibility for variant understandings can be so high within a single discipline,
                     the

                        experience, they were sensitised to how the increasing use of computational and
                        visualisation artefacts in the humanities had been able to produce important
                        results on both sides of the collaboration, but also to critical voices that had
                        risen to point to the perils of producing visual representations that may prevent
                        humanities researchers from performing correct critical interpretations of the
                        analysed data [<a class="ref" href="#drucker_graphical_2015">Drucker 2015</a>]. The pernicious potential
                        results of this effect have been at the centre of many debates among humanities
                        and visualisation researchers and continue up to this day ([<a class="ref" href="#coles_think_2017">Coles 2017</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#lamqaddam_when_2018">Lamqaddam et al. 2018 </a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#lamqaddam_introducing_2021">Lamqaddam et al. 2021</a>]). The root of this problem may be
                        related to the abuse of black-box approaches that diminish the users’ capabilities
                        to understand the inner workings of the algorithms at play and interpret results
                        [<a class="ref" href="#theron_sanchez_towards_2019">Therón Sánchez et al. 2019</a>]. Whereas the correct application
                        of visualisation techniques is known to resolve some of these problems, there is
                        still an urgent need for conceptual HCI and visualisation frameworks that are able
                        to translate the needs of humanities researchers into the computational plane and
                        use them to generate adequate user interfaces that can overcome the aforementioned
                        problems. Along this line, uncertainty visualisation has been found necessary to
                        effectively open the algorithmic black-box and effectively expose it to a human
                        operator. However, the visualisation of uncertainty has been recently reconsidered
                        in connection with how the persons actually perceive the visualisations trying to
                        convey uncertainty, which unfortunately is not usually happening in the way the
                        creator of the visualisation would expect [<a class="ref" href="#padilla_uncertainty_2021">Padilla, Kay, and Hullman 2021</a>], and much of the current work focuses on producing visualisations for
                        evaluating decision-making in ad-hoc use-cases that can hardly be applied to a
                        real humanities research context. To fill in this gap, the efforts presented in
                        this paper are oriented precisely towards building a theoretical visualisation
                        framework that enables collaboration between many human and computational actors,

                        central to the development of the project’s platform. However, as a collective
                        descriptor the term ‘(the) Digital Humanities’ (DH) captures a broad range of
                        research and research-related activities, sectors and stakeholders. This often

                        ways they position themselves in relation to digital technology and with other
                        disciplines. This perspective was represented in the project by Trinity College
                        Dublin’s Digital Humanities Centre, which brings together a team highly
                        experienced in fostering the work of a range of traditional humanities
                        disciplines, including history. This work focused on the experiences of historians
                        and literary scholars with exposure to building and/or using digital research
                        tools. The aim of this segmentation was first and foremost to establish the
                        expectations of a specific intended user base, as only through such specificity
                        could the questions of uncertainty be adequately broached.</div>

                        practices. As the user modelling work of the DH@TCD team showed, a historian may,
                        on one level, question her ability to read a historic text or question the date
                        attributed to a certain event within an earlier interpretation. She may also,
                        however, question whether an event was understood at the time as it is generally
                        described now, or indeed whether the records of a given event have become
                        corrupted or biased over time. The novelty and complexity of DH research combined
                        with the idiosyncratic challenges of working with cultural heritage data mean that
                        uncertainty can hinder substantially in the use and reuse of digital cultural
                        resources, which might make it more difficult for a user to probe the context or
                        provenance of a given fact or interpretation. Throughout the DH analysis pipeline,
                        many decisions have to be made which depend on managing uncertainty, pertaining to
                        both the datasets and the models behind them. Traditional humanities tools for
                        managing uncertainty, such as corroboration among multiple sources, or inclusion
                        of footnotes or explications to note a point of uncertainty, are themselves built
                        on the preservation of complexity and scrutability. This is an epistemic cultural
                        bias that can lead to resistance to taxonomy-based approaches, as the reduction of
                        parameters to fit a simplified model can be perceived as an opening to un- or
                        misinformed conclusions. Yet without such tools, these disciplines cannot benefit
                        from purpose-built ancillary tools in the form of interactive visualisations or
                        novel user interfaces in the digital research environment. The successful
                        development of a fit-for-purpose digital research environment – defined here as
                        the adoption of the tool by the intended user base – is therefore highly dependent
                        on the correct categorisation of the different types of heterogenous phenomena,

                     in visualisation research ([<a class="ref" href="#kay_when_2016">Kay et al. 2016</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#hullman_pursuit_2018">Hullman et al. 2018</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#kale_hypothetical_2018">Kale et al. 2018</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#hullman_why_2020">Hullman 2020</a>]). For this, Digital Humanities represents an exciting
                     field of experimentation [<a class="ref" href="#benito-santos_data-driven_2020">Benito-Santos and Therón Sánchez 2020</a>]. In this
                     regard, the first notable efforts to address the visual representation of uncertainty
                     originated in the fields of geography and spatial data visualisation with proposals
                     describing uncertainty taxonomies whose categories could be mapped to the different
                     available visual channels ([<a class="ref" href="#maceachren_visualizing_1992">MacEachren 1992</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#fisher_models_1999">Fisher 1999</a>]). For example, MacEachren’s employed the concept of
                     “quality” to build his first uncertainty taxonomy, and accounted for the
                     different manners in which uncertainty could be introduced into the data according
                     to
                     the stages of the typical data analysis pipeline. According to this, he described
                     concepts such as accuracy – the exactness of data –, and precision – the degree of
                     refinement with which a measurement is taken. Later in the text, MacEachren mapped
                     these concepts to several visual variables (e.g., saturation), building on the famous
                     previous work on semiology by the French cartographer Jacques Bertin [<a class="ref" href="#bertin1983">Bertin 1983</a>]. In more recent work, MacEachren completed his previous
                     work with two empirical studies focused on uncertainty visualisation in which a
                     typology of uncertainty was matched against the spatial, temporal and attribute
                     components of data [<a class="ref" href="#maceachren_visual_2012">MacEachren 2012</a>].</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p24">In a different approach, Fisher [<a class="ref" href="#fisher_models_1999">Fisher 1999</a>] proposed an
                     uncertainty taxonomy elaborating the concepts of well- and poorly-defined objects,
                     which are used to define the categories into which uncertainty can be classified.
                     More concretely, Fisher’s taxonomy presents a particular point of view within the
                     more verbose taxonomy of ignorance developed by [<a class="ref" href="#smithson_ignorance_1989">Smithson 1989</a>]. According to Fisher’s views, uncertainty
                     related to well-defined objects is caused by errors and is probabilistic in nature.
                     This type of uncertainty is typically referred to as “aleatoric” or
                     “irreducible”. On the contrary, poorly defined objects relate to the concept
                     of epistemic uncertainty, which can in fact be reduced. More recently, Simon and his
                     colleagues adapted Fisher’s taxonomy in their work on numerical assessment of risk
                     and dependability [<a class="ref" href="#simon_data_2018">Simon, Weber, and Sallak 2018</a>], which in turn served us a
                     starting point to propose our own uncertainty taxonomy in the context of Digital
                     Humanities research. Simon et al.’s adaptation of Fisher’s taxonomy is reproduced

                  <div class="ptext" id="p25">The original uncertainty taxonomy by Simon et al. includes four more categories into
                     which epistemic uncertainty might be classified: imprecision, ignorance, credibility
                     and incompleteness. According to the authors, “imprecision
                     corresponds to the inability to express the true value because the absence of
                     experimental values does not allow the definition of a probability distribution or
                     because it is difficult to obtain the exact value of a measure.” The next
                     category, ignorance (which can be partial or total), refers to “the inability to express knowledge on disjoint hypotheses.” Incompleteness
                     makes reference to “the fact that not all situations are
                     covered.” This is especially applicable to Digital Humanities research
                     objects which may have been degraded or partially lost due to natural processes or
                     the different transformations that may have been applied to the originals. Finally,
                     credibility concerns “the weight that an agent can attach to its
                     judgement,”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#jarlbrink_cultural_2017">Jarlbrink and Snickars 2017</a>] and it is also of special importance to the
                     aims of our project. For example, a researcher may or may not trust the observations
                     made by other agents who have previously worked on the same data, according to her
                     degree of grounded knowledge on the subject and personal preference and/or bias.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p26">Although a strong starting point, none of the existing taxonomies was able to satisfy
                     all of the partners in PROVIDEDH, as the balance between refinement and actionability
                     was, in each case, never mutually recognisable. As Skeels and his colleagues noted
                     in
                     2008, uncertainty is referred to inconsistently both within and among domains, they
                     continue that “[w]ithin the amorphous concept of uncertainty
                     there are many types of uncertainty that may warrant different visualisation
                     techniques.”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#skeels_revealing_2008">Skeels et al. 2008</a>] The challenge is, therefore, not to arrive at
                     a single definition that obscures differences of uncertainty, but to build dialogue
                     between different research domains while recognising their differences, and ensuring
                     that any definition of uncertainty the project as a whole would adopt could be
                     applied and implemented by all partners in their own research contexts. This
                     challenges the idea that it is possible to create a single view of uncertainty.
                     “While any group’s ontology is unlikely to match that of every
                     individual within the group, the extent of mismatch tends to increase with the
                     scale of the group and the differences between the purpose of individual and group
                     ontologies”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#wallack_srinivasan2009">Wallack and Srinivasan 2009</a>, p. 2]. The reality is that the
                     development of a taxonomy, which must cater to the needs of a range of disciplines
                     and stakeholders, may often lead to a result in which the specific requirements of

                  <div class="ptext" id="p27">Building on these insights, the group organised a series of shared workshops
                     exploring the issue of conceptions of uncertainty and its relationship to
                     decision-making in different contexts. These workshops commenced from existing
                     taxonomies, such as Fisher’s (reproduced above), and sought to revise them so as to
                     reach consensus, if not agreement, about how conceptions of uncertainty might be made
                     concrete and actionable in a historical research system. The three workshops each
                     approached a different aspect of the overall challenge, focusing first on the
                     historian’s requirements for decision-making as compared to the system's needs for
                     clarity and simplicity. The second continued this discussion with a wider and more
                     diverse group of potential users, and the third looked at the same challenge from
                     the
                     perspective of open innovation. Robust discussions and negotiations about the
                     taxonomy occurred at every one of these discussion points. For example, in the
                     interaction designed to bridge what was perceived as a back-end processing ‘optimal’
                     with the perspective of the historian, nearly every term had to be renamed, glossed
                     and refined, with, for example, the descriptor of ‘error’ being rejected as lacking
                     sufficient precision. The domain experts also strongly advocated for the recognition
                     of time-based element tracing the possible source of uncertainty from the original
                     moment of a source’s creation through the many transformations over time (physical
                     damage, cataloguing, transcribing, translating, digitisation, etc.) all the way
                     through to the task of the researcher itself. Although later discussions continued
                     to
                     be active and important for the purpose of converging both understanding and usage
                     patterns (in particular the meeting to discuss how to further extend the taxonomy’s
                     use in the Open Innovation context), fewer changes were implemented over time.</div>

                     Simon et al. [<a class="ref" href="#simon_data_2018">Simon, Weber, and Sallak 2018</a>] that were introduced in the previous
                     section, the project partners developed an HCI-inspired uncertainty taxonomy aimed
                     at
                     producing effective visualisations from humanities textual data and related
                     annotations (see Figure 4). Findings in these workshops suggested that a matrix-based
                     taxonomy would be of the most use to the project and the potential users of its
                     outputs. This substantiated the earlier work conducted in the context of the KPLEX
                     project (discussed above) which suggested that something like Peterson’s uncertainty
                     matrix for simulation uncertainties in climate change [<a class="ref" href="#petersen_simulating_2012">Petersen 2012</a>] would provide the most effective approach for
                     all sides. The key differentiator was the location or site of uncertainty. For
                     example, Pang and his collaborators describe the different processes through which
                     uncertainty can be introduced into data as: “the introduction of
                     data uncertainty from models and measurements, derived uncertainty from
                     transformation processes, and visualisation uncertainty from the visualisation
                     process itself”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#pang_approaches_1997">Pang, Wittenbrink, and Lodha 1997</a>]. Petersen similarly distinguishes a number of
                     locations of uncertainty: see his model below in Figure 3. </div>

                     (about which much negotiation of terminology was required) the final taxonomy also
                     incorporates a number of other dimensions deemed important for the notation of
                     uncertainty. First, on the y-axis, it incorporates a sensitivity to time and the
                     possible actors that might have introduced uncertainty into a system. This is
                     particularly important for historical research, as an uncertainty introduced by a
                     more recent process (such as dirty OCR of historical texts) may be much easier to
                     manage in a decision-making process than an original gap in what was seen or
                     reported. Similarly, the matrix follows Fisher in applying the concepts of epistemic
                     and aleatory uncertainty, with the former more likely to be a result of human lack
                     of
                     understanding, and the latter more likely to be one of imperfect sources and tools.
                     Truly epistemic uncertainty is the hardest to address, but, as we can see in the
                     taxonomy, there is only one of twelve possible states of uncertainty that is indeed
                     fully epistemic, along with five others that are partially so. Knowing how uncertain
                     a given uncertainty is, makes it much easier to build systems and annotation
                     standards to accommodate it, but it also allows historians and citizen users to
                     maintain their sense of uncertainty itself which is often a complex and potentially
                     hybrid state. Through this instrument, we can see differences between those places
                     that are likely to have wide agreement as to the nature of the uncertainty and what
                     it would take to optimally resolve it (a gap in a primary source), and those areas
                     where the questions are much more individualised, closer to the work of a single
                     historian.</div>

                     demonstrator platform for the investigation of uncertainty in historical texts. Its
                     primary functionality was to structure the manner in which users could indicate the
                     nature and level of uncertain passages in the text and to visualise patterns in these
                     annotations. This enabled a like-with-like comparison of annotations across users
                     and
                     documents. The use of the taxonomy in the system (for example in the visual
                     annotator, see Figure 5, is based upon a conceptualisation of uncertainty that has
                     two well-defined sources: 1) tool-induced and 2) human-induced, which can be
                     respectively mapped to the two main categories devised by [<a class="ref" href="#fisher_models_1999">Fisher 1999</a>] that were introduced in previous sections of this

                     a given algorithm and enhances the what-if analysis process. For example, a
                     researcher could parametrise an algorithm with a fixed set of inputs and launch it
                     a
                     number of times, obtaining a range of mean values and deviations encoded in a
                     document which, if correctly displayed, would allow her to get an idea of how the

                     by
                     other past researchers. This operation mode would provide an answer to the question
                     “What happens if I run the algorithm a million times using my assumptions?”
                     or “What happens if I run the algorithm a million times using another person’s
                     assumptions?”. As in the case of running the algorithm with the same parameters
                     many times, the results of running the algorithm with different parameters many times
                     could also be summarised in a continuous document allowing the said kind of what-if
                     analysis. This would answer the question of “What happens if I use these other
                     person’s assumptions?” or “What happens if I decide not to trust another
                     actor’s assumptions?”. We argue that the insights obtained from the described
                     experiments are highly valuable for the user, specifically in the case of algorithms
                     that are probabilistic in nature, such as topic models, and whose results – and
                     interpretations – can vary greatly between different runs [<a class="ref" href="#alexander_task-driven_2016">Alexander and Gleicher 2016</a>].</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p34">The other category, human-induced uncertainty (bottom), arises from 1) direct
                     interpretations of the raw data (which in turn may be based on others’ previous
                     interpretations and grounded expert knowledge of the user) and 2) interpretations
                     of
                     computational analyses performed on the data or 3) a combination of the two. This
                     category is reported by users of our system in a 5-point Likert scale and thus it
                     is
                     best modelled as a discrete probability function. Moreover, we devised the dependency
                     relationships between the categories in our taxonomy to be bidirectional and
                     self-recurring, since, for example, the input parameters and data fed to the
                     algorithms – and therefore their results – are derived from a user’s previous
                     interpretations of textual data and related machine- or human-generated annotations.
                     In turn, these interpretations must necessarily be built upon previous insight
                     obtained by the same or other users who apply computational techniques to the data,
                     effectively forming a temporal belief network [<a class="ref" href="#druzdzel_causality_1993">Druzdzel and Simon 1993</a>] that is fixated on the different versions of a dataset. In a first stage, we
                     modelled human-induced uncertainty according to the uncertainty taxonomy of Figure
                     4
                     in what was called the 4+1 uncertainty model. Later, and following a series of
                     evaluation sessions and workshops, we evolved the model to support a variable number
                     of human-induced categories. This change was introduced after a series of user-driven
                     experiments and evaluations in which we asked the participants to annotate different
                     types of historical texts (poetry and historical recipes). As we describe in our
                     previous contribution, the uncertainty taxonomy was received positively by the
                     Digital Humanities experts and lay users we engaged with during the design sessions
                     that took part throughout the project [<a class="ref" href="#benito-santos_evaluating_2021">Benito-Santos et al. 2021</a>].
                     From these experiences, we could check first-hand the latent need, as perceived by
                     the participants, for a more nuanced and flexible way of communicating uncertainty
                     in
                     Digital Humanities projects, as well as the potential benefits that this could bring
                     for collaborative work on Digital Humanities datasets. Specifically, we discovered
                     that, sometimes, users could not pick one of the predefined categories when making
                     annotations on the texts. Furthermore, we also detected that there almost never was
                     a
                     100% consensus on the uncertainty type different users chose to annotate the same
                     portion of text: e.g., whereas for some a linguistic variant of a word implied
                     imprecision (e.g., they were more or less sure about a word’s meaning, but the word
                     varied from a standard form), for others it meant ignorance (e.g., they did not know
                     what the word meant). These differences, we argue, are often subtle and very much
                     depend on the mental state, ground knowledge on the subject and other traits of the
                     particular user making the annotation. Beyond that, some users showed preference for
                     labelling uncertainty in a particular annotation as a combination of different types.
                     For example, a user could be more or less sure that a word found in the text
                     represents a dialectal variation but at the same time not be sure of the word’s
                     meaning in a certain context. In this case, the user should be able to reflect her
                     views using a combination of categories (e.g., imprecision + ignorance + 0/5
                     non-credibility + 0/5 gaps). This way of communicating uncertainty, we argue, allows
                     a higher level of expressiveness and is able to capture the nuances of the user’s
                     mental state that needs to be captured and presented to other users working in the
                     same dataset. To allow for even better communication of uncertainty between actors,
                     we allow users to dynamically create new categories as required, which are
                     established on a per project-basis in what is called the n+1 uncertainty model. This
                     departs from the observed effect in our experiments that a group of users working
                     on
                     the same data will naturally establish their own uncertainty taxonomy that covers
                     the
                     needs and particularities of the specific tasks to be performed on the data. As such,
                     they will use it as a communication tool to collaborate in a distributed manner in
                     time and space by appending their annotations to the dataset according to these
                     ad-hoc categories, effectively fulfilling one of the project’s main objectives.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p35">The function of the system ultimately built by the PROVIDEDH team, as a visualisation
                     supported tool for historical research under conditions of uncertainty, was
                     predicated upon the deployment of the taxonomy that underpins it. Interestingly,
                     however, it was also the process of negotiating the taxonomy that allowed the team
                     to
                     function, overcoming the challenges inherent in interdisciplinary work and achieving
                     the goals of their collaborative project. Lee described the effect of “boundary-negotiating artifacts” as twofold, having (1) an
                     effect on the recipient, for whom information is more easily grasped, and 2) an
                     effect on the artifact creator, who must strive to construct an artifact that is
                     easily grasped [<a class="ref" href="#lee_boundary_2007">Lee 2007</a>]. The results of the PROVIDEDH
                     project can certainly attest to this effect and to the largely invisible, but
                     essential, taxonomy and its development delivered.</div>
