                  <p>Applying digital methods as inputs to an interpretive process, I expose compositional
                     motifs within Sandro Botticelli's momentous
                     <cite class="title italic">Divina Commedia</cite> codex that depart from canonical manuscript illustrations. I then situate these 
                     visual findings within Quattrocento literary and artistic theory, arguing that Botticelli
                     manipulated his compositional structures 
                     to harmonize with the humanist Cristoforo Landino's interpretation of the <cite class="title italic">Commedia</cite> as an allegory for the
                     soul's ascension from “disorder” to “order”. By leafing through the pages of Botticelli's manuscript and perceiving 
                     the striking structure and style of the illustrations, the observer could experience
                     the incremental progress of Dante
                     the Pilgrim’s soul — and perhaps the viewer’s own — through the different stages of
                     hell to paradise. Ultimately, I reflect on 
                     the implications of digital methodologies within art history, and how these techniques
                     may enrich or even challenge traditional 
                     modes of “seeing” works of art.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">Sandro Botticelli's fifteenth-century drawings of Dante Alighieri's <cite class="title italic">Divina Commedia</cite> are 
                     an art-historical puzzle. Throughout a lavish codex, the artist widely varies his
                     mode of representation while
                     chronicling Dante the Pilgrim's epic journey through the afterlife's three realms
                     — <cite class="title italic">Inferno</cite>, 
                     <cite class="title italic">Purgatorio</cite>, and <cite class="title italic">Paradiso</cite>. Although Botticelli doubtless illustrated
                     all one hundred cantos (narrative units best understood as “little songs”) of Dante's epic, only ninety-two folios 
                     from the series are extant.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e201">[1]</a> Nevertheless, the surviving drawings confound. Each canticle of Botticelli's series
                     (to use Dante's poetic 
                     unit for a realm of hell, comprising thirty-three cantos) seemingly derives from distinct
                     compositional principles that depart from 
                     centuries of manuscript illustration. 
                     </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">Somehow, the unusual and innovative characteristics of Botticelli's codex must be
                     indebted to Florence's swirling discourse 
                     around Dante's <cite class="title italic">Commedia</cite>. Botticelli, as an early favorite of the Medici family, was
                     raised within the cradle of Florentine humanism. Together with the learned academics,
                     Marsilio Ficino, Politian, and 
                     Cristoforo Landino, the artist participated in the late Quattrocento explosion of
                     vernacular culture and discourse. Indeed, 
                     as will be discussed later, Botticelli often reinterpreted textual sources through
                     his compositions and iconography. 
                     Given this context, Botticelli's <cite class="title italic">Commedia</cite> series must not plainly illustrate a narrative but 
                     instead, with tremendous originality and subtlety, give artistic expression to a poetic
                     invention. However, what precisely 
                     this invention entails, and which humanist thinkers Botticelli called upon, remains
                     to be treated.
                     </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">Most scholars, while acknowledging the codex's unusual deviations from canonical <cite class="title italic">Commedia</cite> 
                     manuscripts and Botticelli's close ties to literary circles, have refrained from identifying
                     cohesive compositional
                     patterns across the many drawings.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e245">[2]</a> Indeed, traditional visual analysis 
                     alone — long a cornerstone of the art historian's toolkit — struggles to address such
                     a multitude of images. As a result, 
                     researchers have largely demurred from addressing the work's totality, opting instead
                     to focus on specific images or 
                     canticles alone. Yet novel observations on the <cite class="title italic">Commedia</cite> must arise not from a biased selection 
                     of cantos, but rather from the entirety of Botticelli's ambitious project. To fully
                     understand Botticelli's work and 
                     artistic intent, we must develop a new way of viewing that can decipher patterns and
                     relationships across the 
                     <cite class="title italic">Commedia</cite>'s breadth, not just its individual parts.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">Recent literature reinforces the need to treat the <cite class="title italic">Commedia</cite> series as a whole object. 
                     Sharifa Turab Lookman demonstrates, for example, that Botticelli did not execute the
                     illustrations in the order suggested by 
                     Dante's narrative, as had long been accepted [<a class="ref" href="#lookman2017">Lookman 2017</a>].<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e284">[3]</a> By piecing together ink marks and compass traces,
                     Lookman discerned several “sets” of folios that Botticelli worked simultaneously. Each of the sets of related folios
                     that 
                     Lookman identified concentrated not on a single canticle, but instead involved sheets
                     from <cite class="title italic">Inferno</cite>, 
                     <cite class="title italic">Purgatorio</cite>, and <cite class="title italic">Paradiso</cite>. Therefore, Lookman persuasively argues,
                     Botticelli conceived of the <cite class="title italic">Commedia</cite> as a unified whole, not as single folios or even clusters of 
                     drawings. Conclusions must then be drawn not merely across <em class="emph">cantos</em>, but also across <em class="emph">canticles</em>.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e311">[4]</a>

                     choices with Quattrocento literary theory, the current study not only provides a novel

                     I argue that the manuscript's varying modes of 
                     representation can be understood as a pictorial expansion of the humanist Cristoforo
                     Landino's prestigious 1481 Dante commentary. 
                     According to Landino, Dante the Pilgrim's soul experiences cacophonous disorder within
                     <cite class="title italic">Inferno</cite>,
                     incremental organization within <cite class="title italic">Purgatorio</cite>, and sublime unity within <cite class="title italic">Paradiso</cite>. 
                     In kind, Botticelli adjusts his organizational schema for each canticle so that it
                     appears to harmonize with Landino's corresponding 
                     allegory — figures are strewn across the page in <cite class="title italic">Inferno</cite>, organized by some centripetal force in 
                     <cite class="title italic">Purgatorio</cite>, and condensed into an ethereal whole in <cite class="title italic">Paradiso</cite>.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e357">[5]</a> By leafing through the pages and perceiving the striking structure 
                     and style of the illustrations, the observer could experience the incremental progress
                     of Dante the Pilgrim's soul — and perhaps his 
                     own — through the different stages of hell to paradise.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p7">One of my central claims is that Botticelli, unlike earlier <cite class="title italic">Commedia</cite> illustrators, altered his mode 
                     of representation to correspond with the central themes of each canticle. More specifically,
                     I posit that the series exhibits a 
                     deliberate compositional arc — from disorder to unity — that was unprecedented within
                     the canon of <cite class="title italic">Commedia</cite>
                     illustrations. To augment traditional visual interpretation, I adopt a two-part digital
                     approach: first, I use digital visualization 
                     of the canticles on the aggregate to expose recurring patterns; and second, I employ
                     descriptive statistics to make concrete how 
                     Botticelli's compositions differed from preceding editions.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e416">[6]</a> These computational methodologies 
                     offer an innovative lens for “seeing”, bringing into sharp focus patterns across the work's breadth. Then, I marry the
                     scientific 
                     and the qualitative by drawing upon historical sources and suggest an explanation
                     for the phenomena surfaced in the data.

                     <cite class="title italic">Inferno XXXIII</cite>, for instance, scientific perspective and chronological narrative are cast aside
                     for a tumult 
                     of episodes and vanishing points (Figure 1). Dante's sinners sequester themselves
                     into distinct paratactic spaces, and all attempts to glean
                     the logic of the patchwork quilt of flesh and agony leave the viewer frustrated and

                  <div class="ptext" id="p16">Statistics offers one possible interpretative technique: heat maps. At their simplest,
                     heat maps elucidate the spatial clustering of 
                     phenomena, rendering once inscrutable data sets comprehensible at a glance. The term
                     “heat” refers not to physical temperature, but 
                     instead to the density of the entity under consideration, where “red” typically indicates greatest concentration. Since
                     heat maps convert longitudinal point data into a single interpolated surface, they
                     wield tremendous — as yet unrealized — potential as 
                     compositional visualization tools for art history. Namely, in the case of a <cite class="title italic">Commedia</cite> manuscript, by labeling the 
                     <span class="hi italic">x</span>, <span class="hi italic">y</span> coordinates of all figures (sinners, devils, penitents, etc.) throughout a given
                     canticle, we can construct a single heat map that reveals patterns in how Botticelli
                     tended to construct his compositions.

                     a web application. In essence, this application recorded 
                     the coordinates of any point clicked with the mouse, allowing for the rapid and accurate
                     collection of figure locations. I conducted this 
                     procedure not only for Botticelli's codex, but also for two Tuscan codices that were
                     in all likelihood familiar to Botticelli, and
                     which he drew upon for inspiration: the Bodleian Libraries' Trecento manuscript, MS

                     of representation (Figure 6). Take for example the <cite class="title italic">Inferno</cite> compositions: the figures are spread across the 
                     page, with many banished to the fringes — a fitting locale for those souls who in
                     life strayed from the righteous path. Returning to Botticelli's
                     <cite class="title italic">Inferno XXXIII</cite>, we find figures are juxtaposed without subordination; no social hierarchy or formal
                     relationships
                     arise from the diffuse chaos (Figure 1). Sinners are literally hewn in two at the
                     edges of the parchment. The viewer's eye, desperate for an 
                     aesthetic focus, wanders across the page. The <cite class="title italic">Purgatorio</cite> heatmap, meanwhile, reveals an underlying centripetal 
                     organization that is consistent with the introduction of compositional principles
                     visible within <cite class="title italic">Purgatorio XIII</cite> 
                     (Figure 2). No longer are figures clustered near the edges in isolation and distress.
                     Instead, the central locations become the most
                     prominent, radiating balance and harmony. And finally, the <cite class="title italic">Paradiso</cite> heatmap illustrates the reduction of chaotic 
                     structure to a simple unity, as seen in <cite class="title italic">Paradiso IX</cite> (Figure 3). Dante and Beatrice float untethered through the 
                     ocean of parchment as if engaged in a cosmic waltz; unconcerned with earthly troubles,
                     they ascend towards the Empyrean.

                     First, a single heavily populated folio could exercise outsized
                     influence on the final, aggregated visualization. The resultant chart would then not
                     necessarily represent an “average” composition, but 
                     instead a “weighted” one. Second, heat maps require arbitrary input parameters, like the raster cell size,
                     which refers to the extent of the 
                     area to group together into a single color. At one extreme, every point in a composition
                     could be contained within the same cell, obscuring 
                     any patterns. At the other extreme, the visualization could dissolve into an unintelligible
                     mass of points that exhibit few trends. 
                     Third, the comparison of heat maps is inherently qualitative. In other words, we can
                     subjectively examine the three visuals and proclaim that 
                     they exhibit stark differences, but how can we be certain such irregularities did
                     not arise by chance?

                     techniques to tackle humanistic research questions. 
                     For instance, archaeologists applied hypothesis tests to evaluate whether social status

                     ultimately concluding that no statistically significant difference existed [<a class="ref" href="#eghdami2023">Eghdami et al. 2023</a>]. Drawing a parallel again to Botticelli's 
                     drawings, we must find a way to <em class="emph">quantify</em> each canticle's thematic variations, and then can conduct hypothesis tests to uncover
                     and

                     as “awkward” 
                     — in fact conform to harmonious mathematical proportions. However, such an algorithm
                     would prove less fruitful when applied to
                     Botticelli's <cite class="title italic">Commedia</cite>, as the <cite class="title italic">Paradiso</cite> illustrations most often exhibit only two

                     As the Dante scholar Rachel Jacoff remarks, 
                     “For Dante, sin is a violation of community” [<a class="ref" href="#jacoff2018">Jacoff 2018</a>]. Indeed, the presence of a cohesive 
                     community most distinguishes Botticelli's three canticles; accordingly, the physical
                     (and therefore emotional) distance between figures 
                     suffices as an adequate measure.

                     a given

                     by canticle, I performed a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), a standard test for

                     representation of the two wayfarers in <cite class="title italic">Purgatorio XIII</cite>, meanwhile, typifies the greater sense of naturalism present 
                     within the second canticle's drawings (Figure 7). Sketched in a mixture of light and
                     dark ink with significant metal point underdrawings,
                     Botticelli's strokes are confident, deliberate, and measured. We here witness the
                     series at its most tangible: the figures of Dante and Virgil 
                     threaten to wander off the page and into the profane world. The pen strokes of <cite class="title italic">Paradiso</cite>, on the other hand, are 
                     thin and hesitant, with no signs of the dark ink that suffused the earlier canticles.
                     As a demonstration, follow the line suggesting the outer 
                     fold of Beatrice's diaphanous drapery within <cite class="title italic">Paradiso IX</cite> (circled in red in Figure 7). The stroke slopes gently 
                     downward, swerves abruptly, and terminates just short of Beatrice's sleeve. A second
                     mark overlaps the first's lower section, but also ceases 
                     inexplicably. This is not an anomaly — Beatrice's whole ensemble consists not of continuous
                     strokes, but instead a precarious assemblage
                     of disembodied lines, each drifting unmoored from its neighbors. The artist's drawing
                     mode thus mimics the evanescent nature of his subject. 
                     The wayfarers are both present and absent, flitting between the ordinary and the transcendental.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e763">[16]</a>

                     then augmenting that discovery through close 
                     visual analysis — illustrates the symbiotic relationship between the scientific and
                     the visual. Even so, the utility of computational 
                     techniques within art history remains limited. As Pamela Fletcher explains, digital
                     tools function as “machines for 
                     thinking with, rather than replacements for thinking” [<a class="ref" href="#fletcher2015">Fletcher 2015</a>]. All too often, researchers indiscriminately apply 
                     scientific approaches to art history and publish their interpretations of the results,
                     unconsciously presupposing an unchangeable context of 
                     seeing. In other words, the original way a work was viewed — what the art historian
                     Michael Baxandall refers to as the 
                     “period eye”, cultivated through exhaustive analysis of historical sources — can differ dramatically
                     from 
                     modern perspectives and so must be considered alongside the data [<a class="ref" href="#baxandall1964">Baxandall 1964</a>].<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e809">[17]</a> Thus, although digital technologies make a formidable addition to the modern art
                     historian's methodological toolset, they merely 
                     complement, and cannot substitute for, deep knowledge and scholarly investigation.
                     Applying these considerations to the current study, while
                     heatmaps and statistical analysis make clear that Botticelli varied his mode of representation
                     by canticle, movement from observation to 
                     interpretation necessitates the introduction of Quattrocento literary and artistic

                     illustrations. Scribes would leave gaps in the verse, and often provide written instructions
                     to the illuminator as well, thereby dictating 
                     the decision of <em class="emph">where</em> and often even <em class="emph">how</em> an artist could work.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e831">[18]</a> But after Nicholas Jenson's 1470 Roman font fixed humanist handwriting in type of
                     an 
                     unmatchable beauty and regularity, attention shifted to pictorial interpretation of
                     the text, as with illustration the craftsman could still 
                     far exceed the printer.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e836">[19]</a> Botticelli's codex, as an explosion of the book,
                     accentuates this cultural inversion: he banished the text to the rough verso, and
                     instead privileged the images on the smooth recto.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e842">[20]</a> If oriented horizontally, and bound in a deluxe codex, the viewer would first 
                     encounter the drawings, and then the text. To be sure, Botticelli incorporated elements
                     of previous Dante manuscripts into his designs. But 
                     of course, Botticelli was also well acquainted with monumental panel painting, and
                     inspired by the Renaissance spirit of experimentation. Indeed, 
                     Botticelli models his topography of <cite class="title italic">Inferno</cite> after Domenico di Michelino's c. 1465 massive panel painting
                     <cite class="title italic">Dante Reading from the Divine Comedy</cite> in the north aisle of the Florence Cathedral, where readings from the 
                     <cite class="title italic">Commedia</cite> had been held since at least 1432 [<a class="ref" href="#rowlands2003">Rowlands 2003</a>].<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e878">[21]</a> Significantly, the aspect ratio (the ratio 
                     between the width and the height) of Botticelli's <cite class="title italic">Commedia</cite> codex is almost identical to that of his 
                     <cite class="title italic">Primavera</cite> and <cite class="title italic">Birth of Venus</cite> panel paintings.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e896">[22]</a> Hence, while translating between media, Botticelli suffused his work with remnants
                     of his storied Florentine
                     panels to emancipate image from text and inflect his drawings with Renaissance innovations.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e908">[23]</a>

                     scholarship on Botticelli's panel paintings demonstrates how the artist's compositions
                     and iconography innovatively reinterpret classical
                     sources.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e925">[24]</a> Stanley Meltzoff, for instance, proposes that Politian was the rhetor (or architect)
                     for Botticelli's c. 1494-95 panel painting, 
                     <cite class="title italic">Calumny of Apelles</cite>, advising the artist on which moralizing vignettes to include, and how they ought
                     to be 
                     represented, based on precedent from classical sources (Figure 8; [<a class="ref" href="#meltzoff1987">Meltzoff 1987</a>]). The sixty-four visible
                     <span class="foreign i">rilievo schiacciato</span> reliefs, Meltzoff maintains, weave an intricate moral argument for the necessity
                     of
                     beauty and eloquence within the liberal arts.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e957">[25]</a> Ernst Gombrich similarly relates Botticelli's <cite class="title italic">Primavera</cite> 
                     (c. 1477–1482) to the philosopher Ficino's Neoplatonism, suggesting that the artist
                     intended the work to impart a didactic lesson to its 
                     rebellious patron, Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici (Figure 9; [<a class="ref" href="#gombrich1945">Gombrich 1945</a>]). Charles Dempsey expands on Gombrich's 
                     thesis, arguing that in the <cite class="title italic">Primavera</cite>, we witness the two great cultures of Italy — ancient Latin and vernacular 
                     Tuscan — brought together in indissoluble union. “Botticelli's painting”, Dempsey writes, “is 
                     informed by such a fine poetic instinct, combined with philological rigor and tact
                     so exquisitely deployed, that it produces its own aesthetic 
                     response” [<a class="ref" href="#dempsey1992">Dempsey 1992</a>, 30].

                     Botticelli apparently pored over the <cite class="title italic">Comento</cite> with great attention. The artist's own <cite class="title italic">Calumny</cite> 
                     composition derives from an ekphrasis found within Landino's text, and the edition

                     and nuanced as its printed counterpart. 
                     According to Landino, Dante's <cite class="title italic">Commedia</cite> presents a nuanced allegory for the soul's ascension from sinful 
                     “disorder” to divine “order”. Gradually, Dante the Pilgrim purges himself of vice and elevates his spirit from
                     profane temptation
                     (“disorder”) to sacred grace (“order”). Misalignment of body and soul reigns in <cite class="title italic">Inferno</cite>, Landino 
                     maintains, while divine governance facilitates penance in <cite class="title italic">Purgatorio</cite> (the most human of domains), and all 
                     mundane structure dissolves under the ineffable radiance of <cite class="title italic">Paradiso</cite>.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e1110">[29]</a> Landino's incremental 
                     organization of the soul relates strikingly to Botticelli's calculated variation of
                     his style and mode of representation in his 
                     <cite class="title italic">Commedia</cite>. Indeed, the heat maps and statistical analysis suggest a familiar story: diffuse
                     cacophony within 
                     <cite class="title italic">Inferno</cite>, where members sequester themselves into discrete paratactic spaces; meticulous harmony
                     within 
                     <cite class="title italic">Purgatorio</cite>, where social organization and divine forces guide both Botticelli's compositions
                     and Dante's 
                     penitents; and unity within <cite class="title italic">Paradiso</cite>, where earthly principles of structure and verse give way to a sublime 
                     simplicity. But to say that Botticelli simply adapts Landino's interpretations is
                     to dramatically understate the innovative and effective 
                     properties of the images. While Botticelli finds inspiration in Landino's allegorical
                     treatment of Dante, his ensuing explosion of the 
                     illuminated manuscript tradition is entirely novel and unprecedented.

                     to Botticelli's <cite class="title italic">Commento</cite>, 
                     extend far beyond compositional analysis. Future investigations could, for example,
                     quantify Botticelli's handling of strokes, 
                     applying edge detection or morphological operators as interpretive tools to describe
                     and measure the line’s comparative weight,
                     curvature, and decisiveness. With recent advancements in machine learning, scholars
                     could even apply digital techniques to reinforce the 
                     connection between Landino's <cite class="title italic">Comento</cite> and Botticelli's series. We have used descriptive statistics to 
                     quantify <em class="emph">visual</em> parataxis (disharmony) within the drawings; we could similarly apply large language
                     models to measure 
                     <em class="emph">textual</em> parataxis within Landino's work and relate the two. Indeed, with the increasing number
                     of digital tools available to
                     scholars, similar analyses will no doubt unearth previously unseen patterns across
                     all disciplines of the humanities, inviting careful 
                     qualitative research and expert interpretation.

                        the null hypothesis is that there is no significant difference between the means of
                        the canticles, suggesting that Botticelli's 
                        compositional approach is consistent across the series. If the <span class="hi italic">p</span>-value is less than a predefined significance level
                        (usually 0.05), we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative: the canticles
                        are compositionally distinct. One key limitation 
                        of ANOVA is that while it can detect differences between groups, it does not specify
                        which groups are different. Another consideration 
                        is the assumption of normality and equal variances in the data, which if not met,
                        may lead to erroneous conclusions.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p47">To address the limitations of ANOVA, the post-hoc Fukey HST was applied as well. This
                        test is designed to compare all possible pairs 
                        of means to ascertain which specific groups differ significantly. In our study, we
                        compare <cite class="title italic">Purgatorio</cite> 
                        vs. <cite class="title italic">Inferno</cite>, <cite class="title italic">Paradiso</cite> vs. <cite class="title italic">Inferno</cite>, and

                        that the mode of representation is significantly different between those canticles.
                        The strength of the Fukey HST is that it controls the 
                        experiment-wide error rate, reducing the chance of making Type I errors (false positives).
                        It's important to note that post-hoc
                        tests, including Fukey HST, rely on the initial ANOVA to indicate that differences
                        exist among groups. If the ANOVA is not significant, 
                        performing post-hoc tests is statistically inadvisable.

                     “<span class="foreign i">cantus</span>”, to reference songs and lyrical composition. However, Dante endows the term 
                     with a new sense — as each of the one hundred narrative units that compose his <cite class="title italic">Commedia</cite>. 
                     Dante presents one introductory canto followed by three large narrative subsections,
                     labeled “canticles”, of thirty-three
                     cantos each (<cite class="title italic">Inferno</cite>, <cite class="title italic">Purgatorio</cite>, and <cite class="title italic">Paradiso</cite>). 
                     The overarching structure of the <cite class="title italic">Commedia</cite>, then, follows the organization: 1 + 33 + 33 + 33 = 100 cantos

                     [<a class="ref" href="#schulzealtcappenberg2000">Schulze Altcappenberg 2000</a>, 35]. Or, as Friedrich Lippmann describes: “[I]n

                     relationship between text and image within Botticelli's series further reinforces
                     the utility of a digital art history approach. As 
                     medievalist Sonja Drimmer warned in an interview, we must resist the temptation to
                     subordinate image to text by asking, 
                     “‘How does the image reflect the author's text’”, and instead inquire, “

                     Making use of computational techniques helps alleviate the risk of imposing textual
                     interpretations onto the drawings, as we 
                     first derive insights from the series as a whole, and then look to the historical
                     sources to add vital context [<a class="ref" href="#drimmer2019">Drimmer 2019</a>].</span></div>

                     proposal — that Botticelli adjusts his mode of representation to suit the canticle
                     — finds literary precedent in Dante's
                     notion of “<span class="foreign i">contrapasso</span>”; literally, Italian for “counter-suffering” (not to be confused 
                     with the ubiquitous art-historical term “<span class="foreign i">contrapposto</span>”). Within the <cite class="title italic">Commedia</cite>, 
                     “<span class="foreign i">contrapasso</span>” refers to the balancing of the sin and the punishment. That is, the retribution 
                     reflects the crime; or, more precisely, the <span class="foreign i">contrapasso</span> exposes the sin's horror through a
                     grotesque perversion. <cite class="title italic">Inferno XX</cite> provides a quintessential example. The sorcerers, astrologers, and misleading
                     prophets must wander across the tundra with heads “twisted — their faces looked down on their backs; / 
                     they had to move ahead by moving backwards; / they never saw what was ahead of them” (<cite class="title italic">Inf.</cite> 
                     20.13–15). Fittingly, Dante condemns those who in life falsely claimed prescience
                     to perpetually look backward at their ill-conceived 
                     crimes, not forward to the future. I suggest that Botticelli's <cite class="title italic">Commedia</cite> program is an artistic elaboration of 
                     Dante's literary <span class="foreign i">contrapasso</span>: just as Dante matches the punishment to the sin, so too does Botticelli 
                     match the composition to the rules and aesthetics of the corresponding canticle. For

                     position within the Medici circle. As such, Botticelli would have been eminently familiar

                     Botticelli may have been exposed to three roughly chronological idioms of <cite class="title italic">Commedia</cite> manuscripts. The categories are:
                     first, those with miniatures interspersed among the text and numerous illustrations
                     per canto; second, those with more extensive so-called
                     marginal vignettes; and third, those with larger, full-width scenes executed above
                     or below the text, including a more complete treatment of
                     events. The second and third styles are typified in the current study with MS Holkham
                     Misc. 48 and MS Yates Thompson 36, respectively, while

                     Yael Rice and Sonja Drimmer. As an example, Rice and Drimmer highlight a recent study
                     on the Habsburg jaw. After an analysis of sixty-six 
                     Habsburg family portraits, the study's authors conclude that the consistent presence

                     Drimmer astutely note, within dynastic portraiture, portrayal of the sitter with a
                     feature distinctive to one of the family's ancestors 
                     helps reinforce the royal lineage. Indeed, the painter's aim was to legitimize, not

                     can further be understood within the context of Florence's posthumous reclamation
                     of Dante. Despite exiling the poet a mere century earlier, 
                     fifteenth-century Florentine aristocrats clamored for the reunification of Dante's
                     body and his birthplace. In 1430, the humanist and statesman 
                     Leonardo Bruni petitioned for the return of Dante's remains from Ravenna (where he
                     died in exile) to Florence. “This man's 
                     glory is such that he undoubtedly adds to the splendor and renown of our city”, Bruni writes [<a class="ref" href="#cachey1995">Cachey 1995</a>].</span></div>

                     (translation from [<a class="ref" href="#baxandall1964">Baxandall 1964</a>, 98]). More broadly, Horace's famous dictum — “Ut pictura poesis”;
                     literally, “a picture is like a poem” — anchored much of the Renaissance's revived interest in rhetoric's 
                     visual manifestations (<cite class="title italic">Ars Poetica</cite>, Line 361). For the given translation, see [<a class="ref" href="#horace1926">Horace 1926</a>, 480].

                     of Renaissance Tuscan, still
                     untranslated into modern Italian or English, Landino's <cite class="title italic">Comento</cite> is a formidable tome. Moreover, the most 
                     comprehensive secondary source on Landino's <cite class="title italic">Comento</cite>, Bruce McNair's <cite class="title italic">Cristoforo Landino: 
                        His Work and Thought</cite>, was published in 2019, and hence previously unavailable [<a class="ref" href="#mcnair2019">McNair 2019</a>]. Botticelli's adaption of

                     argument is that the target audience for Botticelli's <cite class="title italic">Commedia</cite> drawings would be familiar with a whole
                     host of humanist texts, including Landino's Florentine commentary. Typically, this
                     assumption of such a privileged viewer would not stand.
                     Margaret Miles, for example, emphasizes the need to “not focus on the associations and interpretation of a viewer who 
                     was culturally or educationally privileged in relation to most people in his culture” [<a class="ref" href="#miles1992">Miles 1992</a>, 28]. Undeniably, 
                     I am suggesting just that! But, because we know that the erudite aristocrat Lorenzo
                     di Pierfrancesco de' Medici commissioned Botticelli's 
                     drawings for, at least initially, his personal collection, such an assumption holds.
                     For a summary of the scholarship on the drawings' 
                     patronage, look to [<a class="ref" href="#schulzealtcappenberg2000">Schulze Altcappenberg 2000</a>, 21].</span></div>
