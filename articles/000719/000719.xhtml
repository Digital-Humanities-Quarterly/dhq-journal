                  <p>Applying digital methods as inputs to an interpretive process, I expose compositional
                     motifs within Sandro Botticelli's momentous
                     <cite class="title italic">Divina Commedia</cite> codex that depart from canonical manuscript illustrations. I then situate these 
                     visual findings within Quattrocento literary and artistic theory, arguing that Botticelli
                     manipulated his compositional structures 
                     to harmonize with the humanist Cristoforo Landino's interpretation of the <cite class="title italic">Commedia</cite> as an allegory for the
                     soul's ascension from “disorder” to “order”. By leafing through the pages of Botticelli's manuscript and perceiving 
                     the striking structure and style of the illustrations, the observer could experience
                     the incremental progress of Dante
                     the Pilgrim’s soul — and perhaps the viewer’s own — through the different stages of
                     hell to paradise. Ultimately, I reflect on 
                     the implications of digital methodologies within art history, and how these techniques
                     may enrich or even challenge traditional 
                     modes of “seeing” works of art.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">Sandro Botticelli's fifteenth-century drawings of Dante Alighieri's <cite class="title italic">Divina Commedia</cite> are 
                     an art-historical puzzle. Throughout a lavish codex, the artist widely varies his
                     mode of representation while
                     chronicling Dante the Pilgrim's epic journey through the afterlife's three realms
                     — <cite class="title italic">Inferno</cite>, 
                     <cite class="title italic">Purgatorio</cite>, and <cite class="title italic">Paradiso</cite>. Although Botticelli doubtless illustrated
                     all one hundred cantos (narrative units best understood as “little songs”) of Dante's epic, only ninety-two folios 
                     from the series are extant.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e205">[1]</a> Nevertheless, the surviving drawings confound. Each canticle of Botticelli's series
                     (to use Dante's poetic 
                     unit for a realm of hell, comprising thirty-three cantos) seemingly derives from distinct
                     compositional principles that depart from 
                     centuries of manuscript illustration. 
                     </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">Somehow, the unusual and innovative characteristics of Botticelli's codex must be
                     indebted to Florence's swirling discourse 
                     around Dante's <cite class="title italic">Commedia</cite>. Botticelli, as an early favorite of the Medici family, was
                     raised within the cradle of Florentine humanism. Together with the learned academics,
                     Marsilio Ficino, Politian, and 
                     Cristoforo Landino, the artist participated in the late Quattrocento explosion of
                     vernacular culture and discourse. Indeed, 
                     as will be discussed later, Botticelli often reinterpreted textual sources through
                     his compositions and iconography. 
                     Given this context, Botticelli's <cite class="title italic">Commedia</cite> series must not plainly illustrate a narrative but 
                     instead, with tremendous originality and subtlety, give artistic expression to a poetic
                     invention. However, what precisely 
                     this invention entails, and which humanist thinkers Botticelli called upon, remains
                     to be treated.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">Most scholars, while acknowledging the codex's unusual deviations from canonical <cite class="title italic">Commedia</cite> 
                     manuscripts and Botticelli's close ties to literary circles, have refrained from identifying
                     cohesive compositional
                     patterns across the many drawings.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e249">[2]</a> Indeed, traditional visual analysis alone — long a
                     cornerstone of the art historian’s toolkit — struggles to address such a multitude
                     of images. As a result, researchers have largely demurred from addressing the
                     work’s totality, opting instead to focus on specific images or canticles alone.
                     Yet novel observations on the <span class="hi italic">Commedia</span> must arise not
                     from a biased selection of cantos, but rather from the entirety of Botticelli’s
                     ambitious project. To fully understand Botticelli’s work and artistic intent, we
                     must develop a new way of viewing that can decipher patterns and relationships
                     across the <span class="hi italic">Commedia</span>’s breadth, not just its individual
                     parts.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">Recent literature reinforces the need to treat the <span class="hi italic">Commedia</span> series as a whole object. Sharifa Turab Lookman demonstrates,
                     for example, that Botticelli did not execute the illustrations in the order
                     suggested by Dante’s narrative, as had long been accepted
                     <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#">#</a></span>(Lookman
                     2017).<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e288">[3]</a> By piecing together ink marks and compass traces,
                     Lookman discerned several “sets” of folios that Botticelli worked
                     simultaneously. Each of the sets of related folios that Lookman identified
                     concentrated not on a single canticle, but instead involved sheets from <span class="hi italic">Inferno</span>, <span class="hi italic">Purgatorio</span>, and <span class="hi italic">Paradiso</span>. Therefore, Lookman persuasively argues,
                     Botticelli conceived of the <span class="hi italic">Commedia</span> as a unified whole,
                     not as single folios or even clusters of drawings. Conclusions must then be
                     drawn not merely across <span class="hi italic">cantos</span>, but also across <span class="hi italic">canticles</span>.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e312">[4]</a>

                     folios, I argue that the manuscript’s varying modes of representation can be
                     understood as a pictorial expansion of the humanist Cristoforo Landino’s
                     prestigious 1481 Dante commentary. According to Landino, Dante the Pilgrim’s
                     soul experiences cacophonous disorder within <span class="hi italic">Inferno</span>,
                     incremental organization within <span class="hi italic">Purgatorio</span>, and sublime
                     unity within <span class="hi italic">Paradiso</span>. In kind, Botticelli adjusts his
                     organizational schema for each canticle so that it appears to harmonize with
                     Landino’s corresponding allegory — figures are strewn across the page in <span class="hi italic">Inferno</span>, organized by some centripetal force in <span class="hi italic">Purgatorio</span>, and condensed into an ethereal whole in <span class="hi italic">Paradiso</span>.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e346">[5]</a> By leafing through the pages and perceiving the

                  <div class="ptext" id="p7">One of my central claims is that Botticelli, unlike earlier <span class="hi italic">Commedia</span> illustrators, altered his mode of representation to
                     correspond with the central themes of each canticle. More specifically, I posit
                     that the series exhibits a deliberate compositional arc — from disorder to
                     unity — that was unprecedented within the canon of <span class="hi italic">Commedia</span>
                     illustrations. To augment traditional visual interpretation, I adopt a two-part
                     digital approach: first, I use digital visualization of the canticles on the
                     aggregate to expose recurring patterns; and second, I employ descriptive
                     statistics to make concrete how Botticelli’s compositions differed from
                     preceding editions.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e396">[6]</a> These computational methodologies offer an innovative
                     lens for “seeing,” bringing into sharp focus patterns across the work’s breadth.
                     Then, I marry the scientific and the qualitative by drawing upon historical
                     sources and suggest an explanation for the phenomena surfaced in the data. </div>

                     for a tumult of episodes and vanishing points (Figure 1). Dante’s sinners
                     sequester themselves into distinct paratactic spaces, and all attempts to glean

                     simplest, heat maps elucidate the spatial clustering of phenomena, rendering
                     once inscrutable data sets comprehensible at a glance. The term “heat” refers
                     not to physical temperature, but instead to the density of the entity under
                     consideration, where “red” typically indicates greatest concentration. Since
                     heat maps convert longitudinal point data into a single interpolated surface,
                     they wield tremendous — as yet unrealized — potential as compositional visualization

                     illustrations, in contrast, expose how each canticle adheres to a distinct mode
                     of representation (Figure 6). Take for example the <span class="hi italic">Inferno</span> compositions: the figures are spread across the page, with
                     many banished to the fringes — a fitting locale for those souls who in life
                     strayed from the righteous path. Returning to Botticelli’s
                     <span class="hi italic">Inferno XXXIII, </span>we find figures are
                     juxtaposed without subordination; no social hierarchy or formal relationships
                     arise from the diffuse chaos (Figure 1). Sinners are literally hewn in two at
                     the edges of the parchment. The viewer’s eye, desperate for an aesthetic focus,
                     wanders across the page. The
                     <span class="hi italic">Purgatorio </span>heatmap, meanwhile,
                     reveals an underlying centripetal organization that is consistent with the

                     edges in isolation and distress. Instead, the central locations become the most
                     prominent, radiating balance and harmony. And finally, the <span class="hi italic">Paradiso</span> heatmap illustrates the reduction of chaotic structure to a

                     limitations. First, a single heavily populated folio could exercise outsized
                     influence on the final, aggregated visualization. The resultant chart would then
                     not necessarily represent an “average” composition, but instead a “weighted”
                     one. Second, heat maps require arbitrary input parameters, like the raster cell
                     size, which refers to the extent of the area to group together into a single
                     color. At one extreme, every point in a composition could be contained within
                     the same cell, obscuring any patterns. At the other extreme, the visualization
                     could dissolve into an unintelligible mass of points that exhibit few trends.
                     Third, the comparison of heat maps is inherently qualitative. In other words, we
                     can subjectively examine the three visuals and proclaim that they exhibit stark
                     differences, but how can we be certain such irregularities did not arise by

                     discovered that the works’ compositions — previously characterized as “awkward” —

                     fact conform to harmonious mathematical proportions. However, such an algorithm

                     Botticelli’s three canticles; accordingly, the physical (and therefore

                     canto, I computed the mean distance from the topological centroid to each figure
                     (overarching procedure illustrated in Supplemental Figure 2; means for each
                     canticle found in Supplemental Table 1). Next, to evaluate whether the mean
                     spread of figures differed significantly by canticle, I performed a one-way
                     ANOVA (Analysis of Variance), a standard test for statistical significance when

                     flesh and through high-quality visual reproductions) reveals that Botticelli
                     adjusted more than his mode of representation: his drawing style exhibits
                     stunning variation by canticle as well. Within <span class="hi italic">Inferno</span>,
                     the artist sketched frantic, heavy lines in dark ink, evoking the chaotic energy
                     endemic to Dante’s hell. Consider the depiction of Dante the Pilgrim’s figure
                     within <span class="hi italic">Inferno XXXIII</span> (Figure 7).<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e676">[15]</a> Gestural lines start, stutter,
                     and cease, conveying form but not volume. The strokes’ weight lends Dante’s
                     figure material presence, yet their angularity insists that he exists outside of
                     the human world. Botticelli’s representation of the two wayfarers in <span class="hi italic">Purgatorio XIII</span>, meanwhile, typifies the greater sense of
                     naturalism present within the second canticle’s drawings (Figure 7). Sketched in
                     a mixture of light and dark ink with significant metal point underdrawings,
                     Botticelli’s strokes are confident, deliberate, and measured. We here witness
                     the series at its most tangible: the figures of Dante and Virgil threaten to
                     wander off the page and into the profane world. The pen strokes of <span class="hi italic">Paradiso</span>, on the other hand, are thin and hesitant, with
                     no signs of the dark ink that suffused the earlier canticles. As a
                     demonstration, follow the line suggesting the outer fold of Beatrice’s
                     diaphanous drapery within <span class="hi italic">Paradiso IX</span> (circled in red in
                     Figure 7). The stroke slopes gently downward, swerves abruptly, and terminates
                     just short of Beatrice’s sleeve. A second mark overlaps the first’s lower
                     section, but also ceases inexplicably. This is not an anomaly — Beatrice’s whole
                     ensemble consists not of continuous strokes, but instead a precarious assemblage
                     of disembodied lines, each drifting unmoored from its neighbors. The artist’s
                     drawing mode thus mimics the evanescent nature of his subject. The wayfarers are
                     both present and absent, flitting between the ordinary and the

                     2015). All too often, researchers indiscriminately apply scientific approaches
                     to art history and publish their interpretations of the results, unconsciously
                     presupposing an unchangeable context of seeing. In other words, the original way
                     a work was viewed — what the art historian Michael Baxandall refers to as the
                     “period eye,” cultivated through exhaustive analysis of historical sources — can
                     differ dramatically from modern perspectives and so must be considered alongside
                     the data.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e711">[18]</a> Thus, although digital technologies make a
                     formidable addition to the modern art historian’s methodological toolset, they
                     merely complement, and cannot substitute for, deep knowledge and scholarly
                     investigation. Applying these considerations to the current study, while
                     heatmaps and statistical analysis make clear that Botticelli varied his mode of
                     representation by canticle, movement from observation to interpretation
                     necessitates the introduction of Quattrocento literary and artistic theory.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p29">Earlier <span class="hi italic">Commedia</span> illuminators were bound by a textual
                     primacy that restricted and overshadowed their illustrations. Scribes would
                     leave gaps in the verse, and often provide written instructions to the
                     illuminator as well, thereby dictating the decision of <span class="hi italic">where</span> and often even <span class="hi italic">how</span> an artist could
                     work.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e733">[19]</a> But after Nicholas Jenson’s 1470 Roman font fixed
                     humanist handwriting in type of an unmatchable beauty and regularity, attention
                     shifted to pictorial interpretation of the text, as with illustration the
                     craftsman could still far exceed the printer.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e738">[20]</a> Botticelli’s codex, as an explosion of the book,
                     accentuates this cultural inversion: he banished the text to the rough <span class="hi italic">verso</span>, and instead privileged the images on the smooth
                     <span class="hi italic">recto</span>.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e750">[21]</a> If oriented horizontally, and bound
                     in a deluxe codex, the viewer would first encounter the drawings, and then the
                     text. To be sure, Botticelli incorporated elements of previous Dante manuscripts
                     into his designs. But of course, Botticelli was also well acquainted with
                     monumental panel painting, and inspired by the Renaissance spirit of
                     experimentation. Indeed, Botticelli models his topography of <span class="hi italic">Inferno</span> after Domenico di Michelino’s c. 1465 massive panel painting
                     <span class="hi italic">Dante Reading from the Divine Comedy</span> in the north
                     aisle of the Florence Cathedral, where readings from the <span class="hi italic">Commedia</span> had been held since at least 1432.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e799">[22]</a> Significantly, the aspect ratio (the ratio between the
                     width and the height) of Botticelli’s <span class="hi italic">Commedia</span> codex is
                     almost identical to that of his <span class="hi italic">Primavera</span> and <span class="hi italic">Birth of Venus</span> panel paintings.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e818">[23]</a> Hence, while translating between
                     media, Botticelli suffused his work with remnants of his storied Florentine
                     panels to emancipate image from text and inflect his drawings with Renaissance
                     innovations.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e830">[24]</a>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p30">Further, following the Renaissance ethos that “a painting is indeed nothing else
                     but a wordless poem,” scholarship on Botticelli’s panel paintings demonstrates
                     how the artist’s compositions and iconography innovatively reinterpret classical
                     sources.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e841">[25]</a> Stanly Meltzoff, for instance, proposes that
                     Politian was the rhetor (or architect) for Botticelli’s c. 1494-95 panel
                     painting <span class="hi italic">Calumny of Apelles</span>, advising the artist on which
                     moralizing vignettes to include, and how they ought to be represented, based on
                     precedent from classical sources (Figure 8;
                     <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#">#</a></span>Meltzoff
                     1987). The sixty-four visible
                     <span class="hi italic">rilievo schiacciato </span>reliefs,
                     Meltzoff maintains, weave an intricate moral argument for the necessity of
                     beauty and eloquence within the liberal arts.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e862">[26]</a> Ernst Gombrich
                     similarly relates Botticelli’s <span class="hi italic">Primavera</span> (c. 1477–1482)
                     to the philosopher Ficino’s Neoplatonism, suggesting that the artist intended
                     the work to impart a didactic lesson to its rebellious patron, Lorenzo di
                     Pierfrancesco de’ Medici (Figure 9;

                     1945). Charles Dempsey expands on Gombrich’s thesis, arguing that in the <span class="hi italic">Primavera</span>, we witness the two great cultures of
                     Italy — ancient Latin and vernacular Tuscan — brought together in indissoluble
                     union. “Botticelli’s painting,” Dempsey writes, “is informed by such a fine
                     poetic instinct, combined with philological rigor and tact so exquisitely
                     deployed, that it produces its own aesthetic response”

                  <div class="ptext" id="p33">It is reasonable to speculate, then, that Botticelli’s <span class="hi italic">Commedia</span> series also manifests contemporary poetic and literary
                     discourse. Taking Dante as his theme, Botticelli suffuses his <span class="hi italic">Commedia</span> manuscript with the new Florentine culture birthed from
                     Lorenzo de’ Medici and amplified by the latter’s coterie of poets and
                     philosophers. If Politian was the architect of Botticelli’s <span class="hi italic">Calumny of Apelles</span>, and Ficino instrumental for the <span class="hi italic">Primavera</span>, might we hypothesize a rhetor for the <span class="hi italic">Commedia</span> series?</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p34">34</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p34">The likely candidate here is the humanist Cristoforo Landino, whose influential
                     Dante commentary and text, <span class="hi italic">Comento sopra la Comedia</span>, was
                     printed in Florence in 1481.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e929">[27]</a> Botticelli apparently pored over the <span class="hi italic">Comento</span> with great attention. The artist’s own <span class="hi italic">Calumny</span> composition derives from an ekphrasis found within Landino’s
                     text, and the edition was even published alongside preliminary engravings of
                     Botticelli’s series.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e940">[28]</a> Therefore, Landino’s commentary presents a contextually
                     relevant parallel to Botticelli’s drawings that can augment computational
                     findings.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e961">[29]</a>

                     <span class="hi italic">Commedia </span>illustrations reveals how
                     Botticelli develops a pictorial expansion of Landino’s work that is every bit as
                     innovative and nuanced as its printed counterpart. According to Landino, Dante’s
                     <span class="hi italic">Commedia</span> presents a nuanced allegory for the soul’s
                     ascension from sinful “disorder” to divine “order.” Gradually, Dante the Pilgrim
                     purges himself of vice and elevates his spirit from profane temptation
                     (“disorder”) to sacred grace (“order”). Misalignment of body and soul reigns in
                     <span class="hi italic">Inferno</span>, Landino maintains, while divine governance
                     facilitates penance
                     in<span class="hi italic"> Purgatorio </span>(the most human of
                     domains), and all mundane structure dissolves under the ineffable radiance of
                     <span class="hi italic">Paradiso</span>.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e993">[30]</a> Landino’s incremental organization of the soul
                     relates strikingly to Botticelli’s calculated variation of his style and mode of
                     representation in his <span class="hi italic">Commedia</span>. Indeed, the heat maps and
                     statistical analysis suggest a familiar story: diffuse cacophony within <span class="hi italic">Inferno</span>, where members sequester themselves into discrete
                     paratactic spaces; meticulous harmony within <span class="hi italic">Purgatorio</span>,
                     where social organization and divine forces guide both Botticelli’s compositions
                     and Dante’s penitents; and unity within <span class="hi italic">Paradiso</span>, where
                     earthly principles of structure and verse give way to a sublime simplicity. But
                     to say that Botticelli simply adapts Landino’s interpretations is to
                     dramatically understate the innovative and effective properties of the images.
                     While Botticelli finds inspiration in Landino’s allegorical treatment of Dante,
                     his ensuing explosion of the illuminated manuscript tradition is entirely novel
                     and unprecedented.</div>

                     literary exegesis and synoptic illustration, occupies an unmatched position

                     Dalí, William Blake, and Gustave Doré, adapt Dante’s text with their own unique
                     interpretations; however, they all build from Botticelli’s model by elevating
                     image over verse and departing from faithful representation to find visual

                  <div class="ptext" id="p37">This paper applied an interdisciplinary approach involving both traditional
                     visual analysis and novel statistical methods to demonstrate that Botticelli
                     deviated from canonical manuscripts by adjusting his mode of representation to
                     the canticle at hand. Botticelli’s varying compositions, I propose, can be
                     understood through study of the series alongside Landino’s <span class="hi italic">Comento</span>, presenting Botticelli’s manuscript as a pictorial expansion
                     of Landino’s exhaustive commentary. Digital tools thus enrich formal visual
                     analysis, providing a materially distinct way of “seeing” a work of art. We can
                     react to the emotive depth of Botticelli’s drawings, marvel at the master’s
                     treatment of line and form, and then, empowered by digital methodologies,
                     discuss cross-series compositional trends. </div>

                     to Botticelli’s <span class="hi italic">Commento</span>, extend far beyond compositional
                     analysis. Future investigations could, for example, quantify Botticelli’s
                     handling of strokes, applying edge detection or morphological operators as
                     interpretive tools to describe and measure the line’s comparative weight,
                     curvature, and decisiveness. With recent advancements in machine learning,
                     scholars could even apply digital techniques to reinforce the connection between
                     Landino’s <span class="hi italic">Comento</span> and Botticelli’s series. We’ve used
                     descriptive statistics to quantify <span class="hi italic">visual</span> parataxis
                     (disharmony) within the drawings; we could similarly apply Large Language Models
                     to measure <span class="hi italic">textual</span> parataxis within Landino’s work and
                     relate the two. Indeed, with the increasing number of digital tools available to
                     scholars, similar analyses will no doubt unearth previously unseen patterns

                     used to determine whether there are any statistically significant differences
                     between the means of three or more independent groups. In our study, these
                     groups are represented by Botticelli's three canticles: <span class="hi italic">Inferno</span>, <span class="hi italic">Purgatorio</span>, and <span class="hi italic">Paradiso</span>. In this case, the null hypothesis is that there is no
                     significant difference between the means of the canticles, suggesting that
                     Botticelli's compositional approach is consistent across the series. If the <span class="hi italic">p</span>-value is less than a predefined significance level
                     (usually 0.05), we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative: the
                     canticles are compositionally distinct. One key limitation of ANOVA is that
                     while it can detect differences between groups, it does not specify which groups
                     are different. Another consideration is the assumption of normality and equal
                     variances in the data, which if not met, may lead to erroneous conclusions.</div>

                     This test is designed to compare all possible pairs of means to ascertain which
                     specific groups differ significantly. In our study, we compare <span class="hi italic">Purgatorio</span> vs. <span class="hi italic">Inferno</span>, <span class="hi italic">Paradiso</span> vs. <span class="hi italic">Inferno</span>, and <span class="hi italic">Paradiso</span> vs. <span class="hi italic">Purgatorio</span>. If a significant
                     difference is found, it suggests that the mode of representation is
                     significantly different between those canticles. The strength of the Fukey HST
                     is that it controls the experiment-wide error rate, reducing the chance of
                     making Type I errors (false positives). It's important to note that post-hoc
                     tests, including Fukey HST, rely on the initial ANOVA to indicate that
                     differences exist among groups. If the ANOVA is not significant, performing
                     post-hoc tests is statistically inadvisable.</div>

                     “<span class="foreign i">cantus</span>”, to reference songs and lyrical composition. However, Dante endows the term 
                     with a new sense — as each of the one hundred narrative units that compose his <cite class="title italic">Commedia</cite>. 
                     Dante presents one introductory canto followed by three large narrative subsections,
                     labeled “canticles”, of thirty-three
                     cantos each (<cite class="title italic">Inferno</cite>, <cite class="title italic">Purgatorio</cite>, and <cite class="title italic">Paradiso</cite>). 
                     The overarching structure of the <cite class="title italic">Commedia</cite>, then, follows the organization: 1 + 33 + 33 + 33 = 100 cantos

                     within Botticelli’s series further reinforces the utility of a digital
                     art history approach. As medievalist Sonja Drimmer warned in an
                     interview, we must resist the temptation to subordinate image to text by
                     asking “how does the image reflect the author’s text,” and instead
                     inquire “how does the author’s text illuminate what we observe first in
                     the image?” (Drimmer 2019). Making use of computational techniques helps
                     alleviate the risk of imposing textual interpretations onto the
                     drawings, as we first derive insights from the series as a whole, and
                     then look to the historical sources to add vital context (Drimmer

                     representation to suit the canticle — finds literary precedent in Dante’s
                     notion of <span class="hi italic">contrapasso</span>; literally, Italian for
                     “counter-suffering” (not to be confused with the ubiquitous
                     art-historical term <span class="hi italic">contrapposto</span>). Within the <span class="hi italic">Commedia</span>, <span class="hi italic">contrapasso</span>
                     refers to the balancing of the sin and the punishment. That is, the
                     retribution reflects the crime; or, more precisely, the <span class="hi italic">contrapasso</span> exposes the sin’s horror through a
                     grotesque perversion. <span class="hi italic">Inferno XX</span> provides a
                     quintessential example. The sorcerers, astrologers, and misleading
                     prophets must wander across the tundra with heads “twisted — their faces
                     looked down on their backs; / they had to move ahead by moving
                     backwards; / they never saw what was ahead of them”
                     (<span class="hi italic">Inf. </span>20.13–15). Fittingly,
                     Dante condemns those who in life falsely claimed prescience to
                     perpetually look backward at their ill-conceived crimes, not forward to
                     the future. I suggest that Botticelli’s <span class="hi italic">Commedia</span>
                     program is an artistic elaboration of Dante’s literary <span class="hi italic">contrapasso</span>: just as Dante matches the punishment to the sin,
                     so too does Botticelli match the composition to the rules and aesthetics
                     of the corresponding canticle. For the translation of <span class="hi italic">Inferno XX</span>, see Mark Musa’s 1996 edition

                     commentary. As two thousand pages of Renaissance Tuscan, still
                     untranslated into modern Italian or English, Landino’s
                     <span class="hi italic">Comento </span>is a formidable
                     tome. Moreover, the most comprehensive secondary source on Landino’s <span class="hi italic">Comento</span>, Bruce McNair’s <span class="hi italic">Cristoforo Landino: His Work and Thought</span>, was published in
                     2019, and hence previously unavailable
                     <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#">#</a></span>(McNair

                     Implicit in my argument is that the target audience for Botticelli’s <span class="hi italic">Commedia</span> drawings would be familiar with a whole
                     host of humanist texts, including Landino’s Florentine commentary.
                     Typically, this assumption of such a privileged viewer would not stand.
                     Margaret Miles, for example, emphasizes the need to “not focus on the
                     associations and interpretation of a viewer who was culturally or
                     educationally privileged in relation to most people in his culture”

                     1992, 28). Undeniably, I am suggesting just that! But, because we know
                     that the erudite aristocrat Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de’ Medici
                     commissioned Botticelli’s drawings for, at least initially, his personal
                     collection, such an assumption holds. For a summary of the scholarship
                     on the drawings’ patronage, look to
