          <head>Introduction</head>
            <p>Sandro Botticelli's fifteenth-century drawings of Dante Alighieri's <title rend="italic">Divina Commedia</title> are 
               an art-historical puzzle. Throughout a lavish codex, the artist widely varies his mode of representation while
               chronicling Dante the Pilgrim's epic journey through the afterlife's three realms — <title rend="italic">Inferno</title>, 
               <title rend="italic">Purgatorio</title>, and <title rend="italic">Paradiso</title>. Although Botticelli doubtless illustrated
               all one hundred cantos (narrative units best understood as <q>little songs</q>) of Dante's epic, only ninety-two folios 
               from the series are extant.<note> Medieval writers regularly employed the vernacular locution <q>canto</q>, from the Latin 
               <q><foreign xml:lang="la">cantus</foreign></q>, to reference songs and lyrical composition. However, Dante endows the term 
               with a new sense — as each of the one hundred narrative units that compose his <title rend="italic">Commedia</title>. 
               Dante presents one introductory canto followed by three large narrative subsections, labeled <q>canticles</q>, of thirty-three
               cantos each (<title rend="italic">Inferno</title>, <title rend="italic">Purgatorio</title>, and <title rend="italic">Paradiso</title>). 
               The overarching structure of the <title rend="italic">Commedia</title>, then, follows the organization: 1 + 33 + 33 + 33 = 100 cantos
               <ptr target="#lansing2010" loc="139"/>. Of Botticelli's surviving illustrations, seven reside in the Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana,
               while the remaining eighty-five vellum sheets entered Berlin's Kupferstichkabinett in 1882 from the Duke of Hamilton's
               collection.</note> Nevertheless, the surviving drawings confound. Each canticle of Botticelli's series (to use Dante's poetic 
               unit for a realm of hell, comprising thirty-three cantos) seemingly derives from distinct compositional principles that depart from 
               centuries of manuscript illustration. 
            </p>
            <p>Somehow, the unusual and innovative characteristics of Botticelli's codex must be indebted to Florence's swirling discourse 
               around Dante's <title rend="italic">Commedia</title>. Botticelli, as an early favorite of the Medici family, was
               raised within the cradle of Florentine humanism. Together with the learned academics, Marsilio Ficino, Politian, and 
               Cristoforo Landino, the artist participated in the late Quattrocento explosion of vernacular culture and discourse. Indeed, 
               as will be discussed later, Botticelli often reinterpreted textual sources through his compositions and iconography. 
               Given this context, Botticelli's <title rend="italic">Commedia</title> series must not plainly illustrate a narrative but 
               instead, with tremendous originality and subtlety, give artistic expression to a poetic invention. However, what precisely 
               this invention entails, and which humanist thinkers Botticelli called upon, remains to be treated.
            </p>
            <p>Most scholars, while acknowledging the codex's unusual deviations from canonical <title rend="italic">Commedia</title> 
               manuscripts and Botticelli's close ties to literary circles, have refrained from identifying cohesive compositional
               patterns across the many drawings.<note> Hein-Thomas Schulze Altcappenberg, in his exhibition catalogue on the series, 
               stresses Botticelli's enigmatic use of <quote rend="inline">an apparently outmoded narrative technique</quote> coupled 
               with <quote rend="inline">widely differing modes of representation</quote> that depart from canonical Dante illustration 
               <ptr target="#schulzealtcappenberg2000" loc="35"/>. Or, as Friedrich Lippmann describes: <quote rend="inline">[I]n 
               <title rend="italic">Inferno</title> and <title rend="italic">Purgatorio</title> the compositions contain a great
               variety of small figures, whereas in <title rend="italic">Paradiso</title> the scale is larger, and in many of the drawings, 
               Dante and Beatrice appear alone</quote> <ptr target="#lippmann1896" loc="18"/>.</note> Indeed, traditional visual analysis 
               alone — long a cornerstone of the art historian's toolkit — struggles to address such a multitude of images. As a result, 
               researchers have largely demurred from addressing the work's totality, opting instead to focus on specific images or 
               canticles alone. Yet novel observations on the <title rend="italic">Commedia</title> must arise not from a biased selection 
               of cantos, but rather from the entirety of Botticelli's ambitious project. To fully understand Botticelli's work and 
               artistic intent, we must develop a new way of viewing that can decipher patterns and relationships across the 
               <title rend="italic">Commedia</title>'s breadth, not just its individual parts.
            </p>
            <p>Recent literature reinforces the need to treat the <title rend="italic">Commedia</title> series as a whole object. 
               Sharifa Turab Lookman demonstrates, for example, that Botticelli did not execute the illustrations in the order suggested by 
               Dante's narrative, as had long been accepted <ptr target="#lookman2017"/>.<note> Lippman first proposed that 
               <quote rend="inline">Botticelli's designs were produced in the order suggested by the poem</quote>, a claim that was largely 
               uncontested until recently <ptr target="#lippmann1896" loc="19"/>.</note> By piecing together ink marks and compass traces,
               Lookman discerned several <q>sets</q> of folios that Botticelli worked simultaneously. Each of the sets of related folios that 
               Lookman identified concentrated not on a single canticle, but instead involved sheets from <title rend="italic">Inferno</title>, 
               <title rend="italic">Purgatorio</title>, and <title rend="italic">Paradiso</title>. Therefore, Lookman persuasively argues,
               Botticelli conceived of the <title rend="italic">Commedia</title> as a unified whole, not as single folios or even clusters of 
               drawings. Conclusions must then be drawn not merely across <emph>cantos</emph>, but also across <emph>canticles</emph>.<note> The close 
               relationship between text and image within Botticelli's series further reinforces the utility of a digital art history approach. As 
               medievalist Sonja Drimmer warned in an interview, we must resist the temptation to subordinate image to text by asking, 
               <quote rend="inline"><said>How does the image reflect the author's text</said></quote>, and instead inquire, <quote rend="inline">
               <said>How does the author's text illuminate what we observe first in the image?</said></quote> <ptr target="#drimmer2019"/>. 
               Making use of computational techniques helps alleviate the risk of imposing textual interpretations onto the drawings, as we 
               first derive insights from the series as a whole, and then look to the historical sources to add vital context <ptr target="#drimmer2019"/>.</note>
            </p>
            <p>This paper proposes a methodological innovation in the field of art history by applying digital techniques to elucidate the 
               compositional complexities within Botticelli's <title rend="italic">Commedia</title>. By correlating these stylistic
               choices with Quattrocento literary theory, the current study not only provides a novel interpretation of Botticelli's 
               <title rend="italic">Commedia</title> but also sets forth a procedure for digital visualization as a tool to analyze large
               corpora of works.
            </p>
            <p>Supported with observations and visualizations drawn from all ninety-two extant folios, I argue that the manuscript's varying modes of 
               representation can be understood as a pictorial expansion of the humanist Cristoforo Landino's prestigious 1481 Dante commentary. 
               According to Landino, Dante the Pilgrim's soul experiences cacophonous disorder within <title rend="italic">Inferno</title>,
               incremental organization within <title rend="italic">Purgatorio</title>, and sublime unity within <title rend="italic">Paradiso</title>. 
               In kind, Botticelli adjusts his organizational schema for each canticle so that it appears to harmonize with Landino's corresponding 
               allegory — figures are strewn across the page in <title rend="italic">Inferno</title>, organized by some centripetal force in 
               <title rend="italic">Purgatorio</title>, and condensed into an ethereal whole in <title rend="italic">Paradiso</title>.<note> My 
               proposal — that Botticelli adjusts his mode of representation to suit the canticle — finds literary precedent in Dante's
               notion of <q><foreign xml:lang="it">contrapasso</foreign></q>; literally, Italian for <q>counter-suffering</q> (not to be confused 
               with the ubiquitous art-historical term <q><foreign xml:lang="it">contrapposto</foreign></q>). Within the <title rend="italic">Commedia</title>, 
               <q><foreign xml:lang="it">contrapasso</foreign></q> refers to the balancing of the sin and the punishment. That is, the retribution 
               reflects the crime; or, more precisely, the <foreign xml:lang="it">contrapasso</foreign> exposes the sin's horror through a
               grotesque perversion. <title rend="italic">Inferno XX</title> provides a quintessential example. The sorcerers, astrologers, and misleading
               prophets must wander across the tundra with heads <quote rend="inline">twisted — their faces looked down on their backs; / 
               they had to move ahead by moving backwards; / they never saw what was ahead of them</quote> (<title rend="italic">Inf.</title> 
               20.13–15). Fittingly, Dante condemns those who in life falsely claimed prescience to perpetually look backward at their ill-conceived 
               crimes, not forward to the future. I suggest that Botticelli's <title rend="italic">Commedia</title> program is an artistic elaboration of 
               Dante's literary <foreign xml:lang="it">contrapasso</foreign>: just as Dante matches the punishment to the sin, so too does Botticelli 
               match the composition to the rules and aesthetics of the corresponding canticle. For the translation of <title rend="italic">Inferno XX</title>, 
               see Mark Musa's 1996 edition <ptr target="#alighieri1996"/>.</note> By leafing through the pages and perceiving the striking structure 
               and style of the illustrations, the observer could experience the incremental progress of Dante the Pilgrim's soul — and perhaps his 
               own — through the different stages of hell to paradise.

          <head>Digital Visualization Techniques as an Input to an Interpretive Process</head>
            <p>One of my central claims is that Botticelli, unlike earlier <title rend="italic">Commedia</title> illustrators, altered his mode 
               of representation to correspond with the central themes of each canticle. More specifically, I posit that the series exhibits a 
               deliberate compositional arc — from disorder to unity — that was unprecedented within the canon of <title rend="italic">Commedia</title>
               illustrations. To augment traditional visual interpretation, I adopt a two-part digital approach: first, I use digital visualization 
               of the canticles on the aggregate to expose recurring patterns; and second, I employ descriptive statistics to make concrete how 
               Botticelli's compositions differed from preceding editions.<note> Recent scholars have fruitfully employed similar
               digital methods to illuminate patterns across large collections of works. For instance, Alexander Brey recorded the features of an
               extensive Quran manuscript within a digital database, and conducted principal component analysis (PCA) on the resultant data set, revealing
               subtle trends in the complex and varied sura heading decoration(<ptr target="#brey2017"/>.</note> These computational methodologies 
               offer an innovative lens for <q>seeing</q>, bringing into sharp focus patterns across the work's breadth. Then, I marry the scientific 
               and the qualitative by drawing upon historical sources and suggest an explanation for the phenomena surfaced in the data. 
            </p>
            <p>Paging through the manuscript, Botticelli's viewers intuitively experience the differing modes of representation. Within 
               <title rend="italic">Inferno XXXIII</title>, for instance, scientific perspective and chronological narrative are cast aside for a tumult 
               of episodes and vanishing points (Figure 1). Dante's sinners sequester themselves into distinct paratactic spaces, and all attempts to glean
               the logic of the patchwork quilt of flesh and agony leave the viewer frustrated and unsatisfied.

               elegant figures — Dante and Beatrice — grace the page, at once distinct yet harmonious, engaged in an intricate dance about the central axis. 
               Botticelli presents not only concord but also a simultaneous expression of intangibility, where either figure threatens to dissolve into the 
               vellum's vast expanse (Figure 3).

            <p>But a single illustration from each canticle cannot adequately represent Botticelli's momentous series, nor can three hand-picked 
               examples mitigate confirmation bias.<note> Within psychology, confirmation bias (colloquially <q>cherry-picking</q>)
               refers to the tendency of researchers to search for and include only the examples that support their existing hypothesis. 
               In the context of the <title rend="italic">Commedia</title>, that would involve authors' selection, conscious or unconscious, 
               of only the cantos that bolster their previously determined argument.</note> Such limitations are inescapable when analyzing three canticles 
               with thirty-three illustrations each. 
            </p>
            <p>Within textual disciplines, scholars have embraced computational analysis tools that measure word frequency patterns to overcome similar 
               challenges, facilitating a new way to read large text bodies. These software packages serve as an adjunct to traditional close reading, 
               illuminating intricate patterns – such as word usage, psychological tendencies, and language choices – that might otherwise evade human detection.
               <note> A treatment of computation techniques within textual sources is given in <ptr target="#argamon2009"/>.</note> Borrowing from this 
               methodology, although we cannot directly compare so many drawings, we can make sense of a much smaller selection of visualizations that 
               aggregate the compositional structure of the larger group, supporting a qualitatively different kind of insight. A challenge,
               though, remains: how to represent the arrangement of forms within each canticle's thirty-three drawings <emph>at once</emph>, effectively
               creating a visual equivalent of a word frequency map? 
            </p>
            <p>Statistics offers one possible interpretative technique: heat maps. At their simplest, heat maps elucidate the spatial clustering of 
               phenomena, rendering once inscrutable data sets comprehensible at a glance. The term <q>heat</q> refers not to physical temperature, but 
               instead to the density of the entity under consideration, where <q>red</q> typically indicates greatest concentration. Since
               heat maps convert longitudinal point data into a single interpolated surface, they wield tremendous — as yet unrealized — potential as 
               compositional visualization tools for art history. Namely, in the case of a <title rend="italic">Commedia</title> manuscript, by labeling the 
               <hi rend="italic">x</hi>, <hi rend="italic">y</hi> coordinates of all figures (sinners, devils, penitents, etc.) throughout a given
               canticle, we can construct a single heat map that reveals patterns in how Botticelli tended to construct his compositions. 
            </p>
            <p>To expedite the tedious procedure of labeling figure locations (as there are more than one thousand across Botticelli's series alone, to say 
               nothing of the comparative materials that must be considered as well), I designed a web application. In essence, this application recorded 
               the coordinates of any point clicked with the mouse, allowing for the rapid and accurate collection of figure locations. I conducted this 
               procedure not only for Botticelli's codex, but also for two Tuscan codices that were in all likelihood familiar to Botticelli, and
               which he drew upon for inspiration: the Bodleian Libraries' Trecento manuscript, MS Holkham Misc. 48, and the British Library's Quattrocento 
               manuscript, MS Yates Thompson 36.<note> According to a 1495–96 inventory, the Medici library alone boasted at least six sumptuously bound 
               manuscripts of Dante's <title rend="italic">Commedia</title> — all of which Botticelli would have had unrestricted access to, given his elevated 
               position within the Medici circle. As such, Botticelli would have been eminently familiar with most extant Tuscan editions, and perhaps with 
               several other models now lost. For the original inventory, see <ptr target="#piccolomini1874"/>. Scholars have also identified consistencies 
               between Botticelli's codex and preceding models, further confirming the influence of canonical manuscripts. For an instructive treatment on the pictorial
               tradition of the <title rend="italic">Commedia</title> and the illuminator's tradition of copyists, look to <ptr target="#alexander1992" loc="140"/>.</note> 
               If heat map analysis of Botticelli's manuscript, but not these two canonical works (which typify the preceding illumination practice), demonstrate 
               differing modes of representation across the series, I could then support my compositional argument with some confidence.<note> In general,
               Botticelli may have been exposed to three roughly chronological idioms of <title rend="italic">Commedia</title> manuscripts. The categories are:
               first, those with miniatures interspersed among the text and numerous illustrations per canto; second, those with more extensive so-called
               marginal vignettes; and third, those with larger, full-width scenes executed above or below the text, including a more complete treatment of
               events. The second and third styles are typified in the current study with MS Holkham Misc. 48 and MS Yates Thompson 36, respectively, while
               the first style exhibits such minimal compositional variation that statistical analysis is unnecessary.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The heat map analysis revealed no structural differences between the compositions illustrating the canticles in either MS Holkham Misc. 48 or 
               MS Yates Thompson 36 (Figure 4, Figure 5). From the visualizations, the spread of figures is relatively similar, as are the centralized 
               regions of focus. While some variation persists — due in part to Dante the Pilgrim's dynamic environment — a single compositional paradigm 
               of linear organization prevails. No hierarchy of form emerges, as all figures appear equal.

            <p>Analysis of the heat maps of Botticelli's <title rend="italic">Inferno</title>, <title rend="italic">Purgatorio</title>, and 
               <title rend="italic">Paradiso</title> illustrations, in contrast, expose how each canticle adheres to a distinct mode
               of representation (Figure 6). Take for example the <title rend="italic">Inferno</title> compositions: the figures are spread across the 
               page, with many banished to the fringes — a fitting locale for those souls who in life strayed from the righteous path. Returning to Botticelli's
               <title rend="italic">Inferno XXXIII</title>, we find figures are juxtaposed without subordination; no social hierarchy or formal relationships
               arise from the diffuse chaos (Figure 1). Sinners are literally hewn in two at the edges of the parchment. The viewer's eye, desperate for an 
               aesthetic focus, wanders across the page. The <title rend="italic">Purgatorio</title> heatmap, meanwhile, reveals an underlying centripetal 
               organization that is consistent with the introduction of compositional principles visible within <title rend="italic">Purgatorio XIII</title> 
               (Figure 2). No longer are figures clustered near the edges in isolation and distress. Instead, the central locations become the most
               prominent, radiating balance and harmony. And finally, the <title rend="italic">Paradiso</title> heatmap illustrates the reduction of chaotic 
               structure to a simple unity, as seen in <title rend="italic">Paradiso IX</title> (Figure 3). Dante and Beatrice float untethered through the 
              ocean of parchment as if engaged in a cosmic waltz; unconcerned with earthly troubles, they ascend towards the Empyrean.

            </p>
            <p>The use of such heatmaps within art historical analysis, however, has limitations. First, a single heavily populated folio could exercise outsized
               influence on the final, aggregated visualization. The resultant chart would then not necessarily represent an <q>average</q> composition, but 
               instead a <q>weighted</q> one. Second, heat maps require arbitrary input parameters, like the raster cell size, which refers to the extent of the 
               area to group together into a single color. At one extreme, every point in a composition could be contained within the same cell, obscuring 
               any patterns. At the other extreme, the visualization could dissolve into an unintelligible mass of points that exhibit few trends. 
               Third, the comparison of heat maps is inherently qualitative. In other words, we can subjectively examine the three visuals and proclaim that 
               they exhibit stark differences, but how can we be certain such irregularities did not arise by chance? 
            </p>
            <p>While heat maps give obvious visual clues to patterns across the series, to move from general observation to quantification, we must incorporate 
               statistical tests as well. Scholars from related fields have successfully used similar techniques to tackle humanistic research questions. 
               For instance, archaeologists applied hypothesis tests to evaluate whether social status or sex influenced burial types within the Parthian Empire, 
               ultimately concluding that no statistically significant difference existed <ptr target="#eghdami2023"/>. Drawing a parallel again to Botticelli's 
               drawings, we must find a way to <emph>quantify</emph> each canticle's thematic variations, and then can conduct hypothesis tests to uncover and 
               examine any trends. 
            </p>
            <p>How, indeed, can we measure Botticelli's differing modes of representation? No doubt, convolutional and non-parametric methods offer potential 
               solutions. Weinstein et al. raise one possibility with their algorithmic treatment of Paul Cézanne's <title rend="italic">Bathers</title>
               <ptr target="#weinstein2019"/>. By repurposing a dendrology computer application to identify axial symmetry and golden ratios within Cézanne's
               <title rend="italic">Bathers</title> series, the authors discovered that the works' compositions — previously characterized as <q>awkward</q> 
               — in fact conform to harmonious mathematical proportions. However, such an algorithm would prove less fruitful when applied to
               Botticelli's <title rend="italic">Commedia</title>, as the <title rend="italic">Paradiso</title> illustrations most often exhibit only two
               figures, and the diffuse confusion within <title rend="italic">Inferno</title> resists structural analysis.<note> A version of Weinstein et al.'s 
               algorithm modified to detect and quantify violations of proportion rather than adherence to golden ratios, however, might allow novel insights 
               into Botticelli's <title rend="italic">Commedia</title> drawings. </note> The authors' adapted dendrology technique, while adept at locating 
               compositional <emph>harmony</emph>, fails when confronted with unmoored figures and assiduously devised <emph>disharmony</emph>. A more parsimonious
               approach would capture within a statistic the spread of the figures from the center. As the Dante scholar Rachel Jacoff remarks, 
               <quote rend="inline">For Dante, sin is a violation of community</quote> <ptr target="#jacoff2018"/>. Indeed, the presence of a cohesive 
               community most distinguishes Botticelli's three canticles; accordingly, the physical (and therefore emotional) distance between figures 
               suffices as an adequate measure.
            </p>
            <p>And so, to analyze the <title rend="italic">Commedia</title> illustrations through these methods, I took the centroid — the geometric 
               center of a shape — as the <q>middle</q> of a composition (Appendix Figure 10). To quantify the spread of the forms within a given
               canto, I computed the mean distance from the topological centroid to each figure (overarching procedure illustrated in Figure 11 in the Appendix; 
               means for each canticle found in Appendix Figure 10). Next, to evaluate whether the mean spread of figures differed significantly 
               by canticle, I performed a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), a standard test for statistical significance when comparing three or 
               more groups (see Appendix for discussion of statistical techniques).<note> I am indebted to Amherst College's Professor of Statistics and Data
               Science, Nick Horton, for his advice regarding these statistical calculations.</note> In all cases, statistics validated the trends
               first observed in the heat maps: for both MS Holkham Misc. 48 and MS Yates Thompson 36, the analysis revealed no significant compositional variations
               across canticles (<hi rend="italic">p</hi> = 0.751 and <hi rend="italic">p</hi> = 0.279, respectively),<note> The large 
               <hi rend="italic">p</hi>-values found from the ANOVA analysis (<hi rend="italic">p</hi> = 0.751 and <hi rend="italic">p</hi> = 0.279, respectively) 
               did not allow rejection of the null hypothesis that any discrepancies between canticles could be attributed to random noise (Appendix Table 2).</note> 
               while for Botticelli's manuscript, the results indicated that the canticles are compositionally distinct (<hi rend="italic">p</hi> 
               = 2.2 * 10-16).<note> More formally, the small <hi rend="italic">p</hi>-value allowed rejection of the null and conclusion of the alternative 
               hypothesis. One complication remains, however. Although the ANOVA confirms the presence of a statistical difference between the three groups, 
               it does not identify which group(s) are different. I therefore conducted a post-hoc Fukey honestly significant test (HST), which compared all 
               three options (<title rend="italic">Purgatorio</title> vs. <title rend="italic">Inferno</title>, <title rend="italic">Paradiso</title> 
               vs. <title rend="italic">Inferno</title>, <title rend="italic">Paradiso</title> vs. <title rend="italic">Purgatorio</title>) and reported 
               which differ significantly. For Botticelli's <title rend="italic">Commedia</title> drawings, the post-hoc Fukey HST indicated that, indeed, 
               all three combinations are significant to a high degree, and that each canticle thus operates within distinct compositional principles 
               (Appendix Figure 12).</note>
            </p>
            <p>What is more, close study of the series (conducted both on the drawings in the flesh and through high-quality visual reproductions) reveals 
               that Botticelli adjusted more than his mode of representation: his drawing style exhibits stunning variation by canticle as well. Within 
               <title rend="italic">Inferno</title>, the artist sketched frantic, heavy lines in dark ink, evoking the chaotic energy endemic to Dante's 
               hell. Consider the depiction of Dante the Pilgrim's figure within <title rend="italic">Inferno XXXIII</title> (Figure 7).<note> For the 
               drawing style of <title rend="italic">Inferno</title>, and later for the other two canticles, I supply a single example to illustrate the 
               stylistic trend. Of course, as discussed, a single folio from a set of thirty-three is not convincing evidence across the canticle. Further 
               digital art history scholarship(perhaps employing image manipulation to isolate disconnected lines and heavy strokes, for example) is needed 
               to explore how the trend holds across the work’s totality.</note> Gestural lines start, stutter, and cease, conveying form but not volume. The 
               strokes' weight lends Dante's figure material presence, yet their angularity insists that he exists outside of the human world. Botticelli's 
               representation of the two wayfarers in <title rend="italic">Purgatorio XIII</title>, meanwhile, typifies the greater sense of naturalism present 
               within the second canticle's drawings (Figure 7). Sketched in a mixture of light and dark ink with significant metal point underdrawings,
               Botticelli's strokes are confident, deliberate, and measured. We here witness the series at its most tangible: the figures of Dante and Virgil 
               threaten to wander off the page and into the profane world. The pen strokes of <title rend="italic">Paradiso</title>, on the other hand, are 
               thin and hesitant, with no signs of the dark ink that suffused the earlier canticles. As a demonstration, follow the line suggesting the outer 
               fold of Beatrice's diaphanous drapery within <title rend="italic">Paradiso IX</title> (circled in red in Figure 7). The stroke slopes gently 
               downward, swerves abruptly, and terminates just short of Beatrice's sleeve. A second mark overlaps the first's lower section, but also ceases 
               inexplicably. This is not an anomaly — Beatrice's whole ensemble consists not of continuous strokes, but instead a precarious assemblage
               of disembodied lines, each drifting unmoored from its neighbors. The artist's drawing mode thus mimics the evanescent nature of his subject. 
               The wayfarers are both present and absent, flitting between the ordinary and the transcendental.<note> In <title rend="italic">Paradiso I</title>, 
               Dante admits, <quote rend="inline">I could not look for long, but my eyes saw / the sun enclosed in blazing sparks of light like molten iron 
               as it pours from the fire</quote> (<title rend="italic">Par.</title> 1.58-1.60). Of course, how could Botticelli render in permanent, 
               dark ink what Dante experienced as if squinting into the blinding sun?</note>

            <p>Such a process — first clarifying a pattern through digital art-history methods, and then augmenting that discovery through close 
               visual analysis — illustrates the symbiotic relationship between the scientific and the visual. Even so, the utility of computational 
               techniques within art history remains limited. As Pamela Fletcher explains, digital tools function as <quote rend="inline">machines for 
               thinking with, rather than replacements for thinking</quote> <ptr target="#fletcher2015"/>. All too often, researchers indiscriminately apply 
               scientific approaches to art history and publish their interpretations of the results, unconsciously presupposing an unchangeable context of 
               seeing. In other words, the original way a work was viewed — what the art historian Michael Baxandall refers to as the 
               <quote rend="inline">period eye</quote>, cultivated through exhaustive analysis of historical sources — can differ dramatically from 
               modern perspectives and so must be considered alongside the data <ptr target="#baxandall1964"/>.<note> The perils of scientific approaches 
               to art history without proper period context are perhaps most obviously manifest within recent studies of portraiture, as discussed by 
               Yael Rice and Sonja Drimmer. As an example, Rice and Drimmer highlight a recent study on the Habsburg jaw. After an analysis of sixty-six 
               Habsburg family portraits, the study's authors conclude that the consistent presence of large jaws evidences inbreeding. Yet, as Rice and 
               Drimmer astutely note, within dynastic portraiture, portrayal of the sitter with a feature distinctive to one of the family's ancestors 
               helps reinforce the royal lineage. Indeed, the painter's aim was to legitimize, not accurately depict (although as Rice and Drimmer emphasize 
               the notion of <q>accuracy</q> itself varies across time periods and geographies), his subject. By assuming that likeness reflects reality, 
               the study's authors failed to incorporate their genres context, thereby introducing critical bias into their research (<ptr target="#rice2020"/>.
               </note> Thus, although digital technologies make a formidable addition to the modern art historian's methodological toolset, they merely 
               complement, and cannot substitute for, deep knowledge and scholarly investigation. Applying these considerations to the current study, while
               heatmaps and statistical analysis make clear that Botticelli varied his mode of representation by canticle, movement from observation to 
               interpretation necessitates the introduction of Quattrocento literary and artistic theory.

            <p>Earlier <title rend="italic">Commedia</title> illuminators were bound by a textual primacy that restricted and overshadowed their 
               illustrations. Scribes would leave gaps in the verse, and often provide written instructions to the illuminator as well, thereby dictating 
               the decision of <emph>where</emph> and often even <emph>how</emph> an artist could work.<note> See especially 
               <ptr target="#alexander1992" loc="39–42"/>.</note> But after Nicholas Jenson's 1470 Roman font fixed humanist handwriting in type of an 
               unmatchable beauty and regularity, attention shifted to pictorial interpretation of the text, as with illustration the craftsman could still 
               far exceed the printer.<note> Look to <ptr target="#davies1996" loc="48"/>.</note> Botticelli's codex, as an explosion of the book,
               accentuates this cultural inversion: he banished the text to the rough verso, and instead privileged the images on the smooth recto.<note> In 
               codicology (the study of manuscripts), each folio of parchment has two sides: the <q>verso</q> (back) and the <q>recto</q> (front). For vellum,
               the verso is the rough side of the parchment leaf, while the recto is smooth and more suited for detailed illustration. Indeed, the term 
               recto derives from the Latin <foreign xml:lang="la">rectum</foreign>, meaning <q>right</q> or <q>proper</q>. Look to 
               <ptr target="#lyons2011" loc="21"/>. It must be noted as well, however, that Botticelli's <title rend="italic">Inferno I</title> is sketched on the
               verso, since the famous <title rend="italic">Chart of Hell</title> occupies the recto. For a discussion of Botticelli's format, see
               <ptr target="#schulzealtcappenberg2000" loc="18"/>.</note> If oriented horizontally, and bound in a deluxe codex, the viewer would first 
               encounter the drawings, and then the text. To be sure, Botticelli incorporated elements of previous Dante manuscripts into his designs. But 
               of course, Botticelli was also well acquainted with monumental panel painting, and inspired by the Renaissance spirit of experimentation. Indeed, 
               Botticelli models his topography of <title rend="italic">Inferno</title> after Domenico di Michelino's c. 1465 massive panel painting
               <title rend="italic">Dante Reading from the Divine Comedy</title> in the north aisle of the Florence Cathedral, where readings from the 
               <title rend="italic">Commedia</title> had been held since at least 1432 <ptr target="#rowlands2003"/>.<note> For a study of the topography 
               of Botticelli's <title rend="italic">Inferno</title>, refer to <ptr target="#watts1995"/>.</note> Significantly, the aspect ratio (the ratio 
               between the width and the height) of Botticelli's <title rend="italic">Commedia</title> codex is almost identical to that of his 
               <title rend="italic">Primavera</title> and <title rend="italic">Birth of Venus</title> panel paintings.<note> The aspect ratio of
               Botticelli's <title rend="italic">Commedia</title> is 1.5:1, the same as that of the <title rend="italic">Primavera</title> (1.5:1), and very 
               close to that of the <title rend="italic">Birth of Venus</title> (1.6:1). Canonical illuminated manuscripts, by contrast, have aspect ratios in the
               neighborhood of 0.6:1.</note> Hence, while translating between media, Botticelli suffused his work with remnants of his storied Florentine
               panels to emancipate image from text and inflect his drawings with Renaissance innovations.<note> Botticelli's <title rend="italic">Commedia</title> 
               can further be understood within the context of Florence's posthumous reclamation of Dante. Despite exiling the poet a mere century earlier, 
               fifteenth-century Florentine aristocrats clamored for the reunification of Dante's body and his birthplace. In 1430, the humanist and statesman 
               Leonardo Bruni petitioned for the return of Dante's remains from Ravenna (where he died in exile) to Florence. <quote rend="inline">This man's 
               glory is such that he undoubtedly adds to the splendor and renown of our city</quote>, Bruni writes <ptr target="#cachey1995"/>.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Further, following the Renaissance ethos that <quote rend="inline">a painting is indeed nothing else but a wordless poem</quote>, 
               scholarship on Botticelli's panel paintings demonstrates how the artist's compositions and iconography innovatively reinterpret classical
               sources.<note> The Italian humanist Bartolomeo Fazio then continues, in his Quattrocento treatise <title rend="italic">De pictoribus</title>: 
               <quote rend="inline">For truly almost equal attention is given by both to the invention and the arrangement of their work</quote>
               (translation from <ptr target="#baxandall1964" loc="98"/>). More broadly, Horace's famous dictum — <quote rend="inline">Ut pictura poesis</quote>;
               literally, <quote rend="inline">a picture is like a poem</quote> — anchored much of the Renaissance's revived interest in rhetoric's 
               visual manifestations (<title rend="italic">Ars Poetica</title>, Line 361). For the given translation, see <ptr target="#horace1926" loc="480"/>.
               </note> Stanley Meltzoff, for instance, proposes that Politian was the rhetor (or architect) for Botticelli's c. 1494-95 panel painting, 
               <title rend="italic">Calumny of Apelles</title>, advising the artist on which moralizing vignettes to include, and how they ought to be 
               represented, based on precedent from classical sources (Figure 8; <ptr target="#meltzoff1987"/>). The sixty-four visible
               <foreign xml:lang="it">rilievo schiacciato</foreign> reliefs, Meltzoff maintains, weave an intricate moral argument for the necessity of
               beauty and eloquence within the liberal arts.<note> Such a statement, Meltzoff continues, was needed given the ascetic friar Savonarola's 
               sermons advocating that even Christian poetry and eloquence were mere pig swill, fit only for animal natures (<ptr target="#meltzoff1987" loc="86"/>. 
               <foreign xml:lang="it">Rilievo schiacciato</foreign> is a sculpting technique that allows for flattened reliefs to represent convincing
               spatial recession through optical illusion.</note> Ernst Gombrich similarly relates Botticelli's <title rend="italic">Primavera</title> 
               (c. 1477–1482) to the philosopher Ficino's Neoplatonism, suggesting that the artist intended the work to impart a didactic lesson to its 
               rebellious patron, Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici (Figure 9; <ptr target="#gombrich1945"/>). Charles Dempsey expands on Gombrich's 
               thesis, arguing that in the <title rend="italic">Primavera</title>, we witness the two great cultures of Italy — ancient Latin and vernacular 
               Tuscan — brought together in indissoluble union. <quote rend="inline">Botticelli's painting</quote>, Dempsey writes, <quote rend="inline">is 
               informed by such a fine poetic instinct, combined with philological rigor and tact so exquisitely deployed, that it produces its own aesthetic 
               response</quote> <ptr target="#dempsey1992" loc="30"/>.

            <p>It is reasonable to speculate, then, that Botticelli's <title rend="italic">Commedia</title> series also manifests contemporary poetic 
               and literary discourse. Taking Dante as his theme, Botticelli suffuses his <title rend="italic">Commedia</title> manuscript with the new 
               Florentine culture birthed from Lorenzo de' Medici and amplified by the latter's coterie of poets and philosophers. If Politian was the 
               architect of Botticelli's <title rend="italic">Calumny of Apelles</title>, and Ficino instrumental for the <title rend="italic">Primavera</title>, 
               might we hypothesize a rhetor for the <title rend="italic">Commedia</title> series?
            </p>
            <p>The likely candidate here is the humanist Cristoforo Landino, whose influential Dante commentary and text, <title rend="italic">Comento 
               sopra la Comedia</title>, was printed in Florence in 1481.<note> For the full argument, summarized here, look to <ptr target="#corley2020"/>.</note> 
               Botticelli apparently pored over the <title rend="italic">Comento</title> with great attention. The artist's own <title rend="italic">Calumny</title> 
               composition derives from an ekphrasis found within Landino's text, and the edition was even published alongside preliminary engravings of
               Botticelli's series.<note> And yet, scholars have largely neglected Landino's commentary. As two thousand pages of Renaissance Tuscan, still
               untranslated into modern Italian or English, Landino's <title rend="italic">Comento</title> is a formidable tome. Moreover, the most 
               comprehensive secondary source on Landino's <title rend="italic">Comento</title>, Bruce McNair's <title rend="italic">Cristoforo Landino: 
               His Work and Thought</title>, was published in 2019, and hence previously unavailable <ptr target="#mcnair2019"/>. Botticelli's adaption of 
               Landino's <title rend="italic">Calumny</title> ekphrasis is first advanced in <ptr target="#dressen2017"/>.</note> Therefore, Landino's 
               commentary presents a contextually relevant parallel to Botticelli’s drawings that can augment computational findings.<note> Implicit in my 
               argument is that the target audience for Botticelli's <title rend="italic">Commedia</title> drawings would be familiar with a whole
               host of humanist texts, including Landino's Florentine commentary. Typically, this assumption of such a privileged viewer would not stand.
               Margaret Miles, for example, emphasizes the need to <quote rend="inline">not focus on the associations and interpretation of a viewer who 
               was culturally or educationally privileged in relation to most people in his culture</quote> <ptr target="#miles1992" loc="28"/>. Undeniably, 
               I am suggesting just that! But, because we know that the erudite aristocrat Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici commissioned Botticelli's 
               drawings for, at least initially, his personal collection, such an assumption holds. For a summary of the scholarship on the drawings' 
               patronage, look to <ptr target="#schulzealtcappenberg2000" loc="21"/>.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Study of the <title rend="italic">Comento</title> alongside the <title rend="italic">Commedia </title>illustrations reveals how
               Botticelli develops a pictorial expansion of Landino's work that is every bit as innovative and nuanced as its printed counterpart. 
               According to Landino, Dante's <title rend="italic">Commedia</title> presents a nuanced allegory for the soul's ascension from sinful 
               <q>disorder</q> to divine <q>order</q>. Gradually, Dante the Pilgrim purges himself of vice and elevates his spirit from profane temptation
               (<q>disorder</q>) to sacred grace (<q>order</q>). Misalignment of body and soul reigns in <title rend="italic">Inferno</title>, Landino 
               maintains, while divine governance facilitates penance in <title rend="italic">Purgatorio</title> (the most human of domains), and all 
               mundane structure dissolves under the ineffable radiance of <title rend="italic">Paradiso</title>.<note> Summarized from original primary-source 
               study of Landino's text alongside Bruce McNair's instructive monograph <ptr target="#mcnair2019"/>. </note> Landino's incremental 
               organization of the soul relates strikingly to Botticelli's calculated variation of his style and mode of representation in his 
               <title rend="italic">Commedia</title>. Indeed, the heat maps and statistical analysis suggest a familiar story: diffuse cacophony within 
               <title rend="italic">Inferno</title>, where members sequester themselves into discrete paratactic spaces; meticulous harmony within 
               <title rend="italic">Purgatorio</title>, where social organization and divine forces guide both Botticelli's compositions and Dante's 
               penitents; and unity within <title rend="italic">Paradiso</title>, where earthly principles of structure and verse give way to a sublime 
               simplicity. But to say that Botticelli simply adapts Landino's interpretations is to dramatically understate the innovative and effective 
               properties of the images. While Botticelli finds inspiration in Landino's allegorical treatment of Dante, his ensuing explosion of the 
               illuminated manuscript tradition is entirely novel and unprecedented.

          <head>Conclusion</head>
            <p>Botticelli's <title rend="italic">Commedia</title> series, at once literary exegesis and synoptic illustration, occupies an 
               unmatched position within Dante's illuminated tradition. Later cycles, including those of Salvador Dalí, William Blake, and Gustave Doré, 
               adapt Dante's text with their own unique interpretations; however, they all build from Botticelli's model by elevating image over verse 
               and departing from faithful representation to find visual equivalents of the human phenomena that Dante the Pilgrim experiences.
            </p>
            <p>This paper applied an interdisciplinary approach involving both traditional visual analysis and novel statistical methods to demonstrate 
               that Botticelli deviated from canonical manuscripts by adjusting his mode of representation to the canticle at hand. Botticelli's 
               varying compositions, I propose, can be understood through study of the series alongside Landino's <title rend="italic">Comento</title>, 
               presenting Botticelli's manuscript as a pictorial expansion of Landino's exhaustive commentary. Digital tools thus enrich formal visual
               analysis, providing a materially distinct way of <q>seeing</q> a work of art. We can react to the emotive depth of Botticelli's drawings, 
               marvel at the master's treatment of line and form, and then, empowered by digital methodologies, discuss cross-series compositional trends. 
            </p>
            <p>However, the possible applications of digital techniques to art history, and even to Botticelli's <title rend="italic">Commento</title>, 
               extend far beyond compositional analysis. Future investigations could, for example, quantify Botticelli's handling of strokes, 
               applying edge detection or morphological operators as interpretive tools to describe and measure the line’s comparative weight,
               curvature, and decisiveness. With recent advancements in machine learning, scholars could even apply digital techniques to reinforce the 
               connection between Landino's <title rend="italic">Comento</title> and Botticelli's series. We have used descriptive statistics to 
               quantify <emph>visual</emph> parataxis (disharmony) within the drawings; we could similarly apply large language models to measure 
               <emph>textual</emph> parataxis within Landino's work and relate the two. Indeed, with the increasing number of digital tools available to
               scholars, similar analyses will no doubt unearth previously unseen patterns across all disciplines of the humanities, inviting careful 
               qualitative research and expert interpretation.

          <div>
            <head>One-way ANOVA</head>
              <p>One-way ANOVA is a statistical test used to determine whether there are any statistically significant differences
                 between the means of three or more independent groups. In our study, these groups are represented by Botticelli's three canticles: 
                 <title rend="italic">Inferno</title>, <title rend="italic">Purgatorio</title>, and <title rend="italic">Paradiso</title>. In this case, 
                 the null hypothesis is that there is no significant difference between the means of the canticles, suggesting that Botticelli's 
                 compositional approach is consistent across the series. If the <hi rend="italic">p</hi>-value is less than a predefined significance level
                 (usually 0.05), we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative: the canticles are compositionally distinct. One key limitation 
                 of ANOVA is that while it can detect differences between groups, it does not specify which groups are different. Another consideration 
                 is the assumption of normality and equal variances in the data, which if not met, may lead to erroneous conclusions.
              </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <head>Post-hoc Fukey HST</head>
              <p>To address the limitations of ANOVA, the post-hoc Fukey HST was applied as well. This test is designed to compare all possible pairs 
                 of means to ascertain which specific groups differ significantly. In our study, we compare <title rend="italic">Purgatorio</title> 
                 vs. <title rend="italic">Inferno</title>, <title rend="italic">Paradiso</title> vs. <title rend="italic">Inferno</title>, and 
                 <title rend="italic">Paradiso</title> vs. <title rend="italic">Purgatorio</title>. If a significant difference is found, it suggests 
                 that the mode of representation is significantly different between those canticles. The strength of the Fukey HST is that it controls the 
                 experiment-wide error rate, reducing the chance of making Type I errors (false positives). It's important to note that post-hoc
                 tests, including Fukey HST, rely on the initial ANOVA to indicate that differences exist among groups. If the ANOVA is not significant, 
                 performing post-hoc tests is statistically inadvisable.
