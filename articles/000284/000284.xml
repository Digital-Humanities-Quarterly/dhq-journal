                <p>A project is a basic unit of digital humanities (DH) scholarship, which suggests
                    that DH as a discipline should pay more attention to project management, and
                    perhaps to develop the project management models, principles, and methods that
                    are more specific to the discipline. However, DH literature deals with this
                    issue merely by listing the basic principles, or offering specific
                        <soCalled>tips and tricks,</soCalled> which seriously simplifies management
                    of DH projects. DH projects involve building (or at least using) digital tools,
                    which brings the complex tensions between digital and humanistic aspects of
                    these projects. In order to address such a complexity, there is a need for a
                    model for managing DH projects that will learn from information studies and
                    methods in software development, while still being based on values of the
                    humanistic tradition and methods. This article combines a model of scholarly
                    information practices with some concepts of agile software development into a
                    hybrid model for managing DH projects.</p>

                <head>Introduction</head>
                <p>Digital Humanities (DH) is scholarship that is commonly practiced through
                    collaborative work, organised in projects. Burdick et al. claim that such
                    team-based approach challenges traditional humanities, which are still based on
                    individual authorship <ptr target="#burdick2012"/>. They point out that although
                    knowledge has always been produced and accessed in fundamentally distributed
                    ways, there is a myth presenting the humanities scholars as solitary genius,
                    working alone on a creative work. In a DH project, however, collaborative
                    knowledge production is more obvious, as a single person cannot possibly carry
                    out all aspects of the project. It is a common practice <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#burdick2012">for dozens of people to work on a Digital Humanities
                            project, each contributing domain-specific expertise that enables a
                            research question to be conceptualized, answered, and then
                            re-conceptualized and re-answered</quote>
                        <ptr target="#burdick2012" loc="49"/>
                    </cit>. For this reason, one would assume that project management is an
                    important focus of the discipline, and that there are already some project
                    management models, principles, and methods developed, which are more specific to
                    the discipline.</p>
                <p>However, in spite of such significance of project-based work for DH, it seems
                    that complexity of managing DH projects is still not fully recognised within the
                    discipline. Reed notes that project management in DH is usually presented from a
                    beginner’s perspective, offering merely <soCalled>basic principles,</soCalled>
                    <soCalled>tips and tricks,</soCalled> or <soCalled>top-ten lists</soCalled>
                    <ptr target="#reed2014"/>. Such an approach to project management is likely to
                    render a too simplistic trajectory of any research project, and in particular a
                    DH project since working at the interface between humanities research questions
                    and evolving digital methods makes the trajectories of DH work more difficult to
                    capture than those of traditional scholarship <ptr target="#brown2009"/>. A tip,
                    a trick, or an advice might address a specific issue, but managing a complex
                    interplay between digital and humanistic aspects of DH projects requires
                    consideration of insights and methods from different disciplines. This article
                    will combine the insights from the humanities and information studies with
                    methods in software development in order to develop a hybrid model for managing
                    DH project. The model will be based on an existing model of scholarly
                    information practices, and it will adopt its main elements from agile project
                    management methods.</p>
                <p>The article will first discuss an argument of some DH scholars that project is a
                    basic unit of DH, suggesting a need for developing a model for managing DH
                    projects. As project-based scholarship of DH differs from traditional
                    scholarship in being experimental, modular and incremental, and involving many
                    dimensions of digital design and technology. The second section will introduce
                    agile project management methods as appropriate for managing such features of DH
                    projects. However, the agile methods, being primarily methods for managing
                    software development, put greater emphasis on digital rather than research
                    aspects of DH projects. A customer orientation of the agile methods
                    conceptualises their main target group as users, while the main target group in
                    DH are the humanities scholars, who are supposed to be not only users but also
                    co-creators in DH projects <ptr target="#svensson2009"/>. In order to make a
                    balance between digital and the humanities sides of DH projects, the third
                    section will propose a model of scholarly information practices, based on
                        <term>actor-network theory</term> (ANT), to be combined with the agile
                    methods into a new model. Finally, the new hybrid model for managing DH projects
                    will be presented. The final section will describe the main elements of the
                    model, and discuss the proposed stages in the lifecycle of DH projects.</p>

                <head>Project as a Basic Unit of DH</head>
                <p>DH is project-oriented scholarship. DH scholars organise their undertakings in
                    terms of projects as collaborative research endeavours, which are, as the verb
                    'to project' suggests, future-oriented <ptr target="#brown2009"/>. Burdick et
                    al. consider project as the basic unit of digital humanities <ptr target="#burdick2012"/>. They argue that a DH project is an academic work,
                    which like any other project requires design, project management, negotiations,
                    and collaboration. However, a DH project is also projecting in a futurist sense
                    as something that still does not exist, and in which project team members
                    contribute complementary skills and interests in order to conceptualise research
                    questions and to design possible ways to answer these questions. DH projects are
                    thus <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#burdick2012">projective, involving iterative processes and many
                            dimensions of coordination, experimentation, and production</quote>
                        <ptr target="#burdick2012" loc="124"/>
                    </cit>. </p>
                <p>Burdick et al. point out that despite many difference between projects of digital
                    and traditional humanities, there are many similarities among them <ptr target="#burdick2012"/>. Both digital and traditional humanities involve
                    practices of analysis, critics, interpretations, editing, historical research,
                    relations between individual and society, etc. DH also deal with qualitative
                    features of human experience such as complexity, ambiguity, media specificity,
                    and subjectivity. Although DH extends beyond textual media, the aim of DH is to
                    be based on values of the humanistic tradition: tendency for analytical rigour
                    and clarity, building of effective arguments, rigourous use of evidence, and
                    communicative expression.</p>
                <p>However, an issue on which DH differ from traditional humanities is an
                    understanding of contribution of digital media to the humanities in general. DH
                    does not try to neglect print culture, or to merely translate it into digital
                    media, but rather tries to develop <soCalled>print-plus</soCalled> or
                        <soCalled>post-print</soCalled> models of knowledge <ptr target="#burdick2012" loc="125"/>. Such a model involves much more than
                    simply adaptation to digital media, that is a cognitive and epistemological
                    modification of the humanities, and the increasing role of team work and
                    collaboration in the humanities research projects. On one side, print offers a
                    literary organisation and research results that are characterised as stable, and
                    a size of document (and consequently argument) that is confined by the physical
                    size of a book or other printed material. On the other side, digital technology
                    enables a rapid move of view from one to another angle. It enables a fluid
                    change through zooming from macro to micro, and vice versa, and mixing of
                    different kinds of data into research results. It enables flittering and
                    versioning of corpuses and multilinear forms of argument. DH projects are
                    considered more as process-based rather than product-based. Burdick et al. point
                    out that when a book goes to print, it stabilises research results, and if we
                    want to make change we will need to wait for the next edition <ptr target="#burdick2012"/>. Digital artefacts can be changed at any moment, and
                    they can have different lives in different platforms at the same time. Such
                    artefacts can be mixed with other media, they can be changed by others during
                    and after a project. Therefore, DH projects should have different design than
                    projects in traditional humanities.</p>
                <p>DH projects frequently involve building (or at least using) digital tools, which
                    foregrounds the embedded tensions between digital and humanistic in DH
                    discipline itself. Svensson argues that DH is dominated by two basic trends: one
                    focusing on building digital technology tools, and another, focusing on using
                    digital technology as a communication tool in the humanities <ptr target="#svensson2010"/>. McPherson defines these trends as the computing
                    humanities approach, concerned with digitising and preserving the human records,
                    so the focus is on building tools and infrastructure; and blogging humanities
                    approach, focusing on using new modes of peer-to-peer conversation to
                    disseminate the scholarship <ptr target="#mcpherson2009"/>. She identifies
                    multimodal DH as an alternative approach, which is <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#mcpherson2009">about navigating new pathways through scholarly
                            materials that can transform the questions scholarship might ask</quote>
                        <ptr target="#mcpherson2009" loc="122"/>
                    </cit>. The clash of assumptions between traditional and digital humanities is
                    marked by tensions between digital and humanistic, thus between different ways
                    of thinking and practice of computing and the humanities. Svensson claims that
                    these tensions have been created by different epistemic commitments which create
                    different modes of knowledge. These tensions have a great impact (implicitly or
                    explicitly) on managing DH projects <ptr target="#svensson2012"/>.</p>
                <p>The definition of management itself adds another tension to the complexity of
                    management of DH projects. Brown et al. note that while management practices are
                    commonly defined as carefully planned practices to achieve a particular aim,
                    many successful DH projects have not been designed to achieve a very specific
                    aim <ptr target="#brown2009"/>. They claim that the success of these projects
                    are not in relation to particular aims but their success is measured in other
                    ways. The reason for this is the multi-faceted nature of much DH research, which
                    tries to balance between traditional humanities content and innovative
                    technological experimentations. Such an experimental nature of DH research makes
                    modularity and incrementalism the main features of DH project management. While
                    traditional humanities tend to disseminate at least partially complete arguments
                    through relatively stable print media, DH projects produce only provisional
                    stability of argument. So just as software products are marked by a release
                    number, <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#brown2009">which provide the triumphant moment of celebration
                            while suggesting that more is yet to come, designing projects to
                            incorporate such incrementalism by way of staged releases that mark
                            phases of accomplishment or a number of discrete and in some way
                            publishable deliverables, seems a particularly useful way to structure
                            digital projects</quote>
                        <ptr target="#brown2009"/>
                    </cit>. These common features of software development and DH projects
                    (modularity and incrementalism) suggest that management of DH have something to
                    learn from methods in software development and <term>information system</term>
                    (IS) design, while still being based on values of the humanistic tradition and
                    methods.</p>
                <p>As DH projects include building or using digital tools, it seems reasonable the
                    claims that the user studies should be utilised in their management. Warwick
                    notes that it was not a common practice to study users in DH, as there was an
                    assumption that the traditional humanists were not competent about digital
                    technology <ptr target="#warwick2012"/>. A common strategy was to provide users
                    with a digital tool, train them to use it, and hopefully they would adopt it.
                    However in the last two decades, there was a number of studies to investigate
                    information practices of scholars in the humanities. The general findings of
                    these studies suggest that scholars from the humanities have different
                    information behaviour than scholars from natural and physical sciences, and that
                    it is more difficult to design digital tools for the humanities scholars. Kemman
                    and Kleppe show the benefits of involving user research in managing DH projects.
                    They argue that the identification of <soCalled>the out-of-scope user
                        requirements</soCalled> can inform us about the digital tool’s compatibility
                    with existing research practices, while <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#kemman2015">the user requirements that were within-scope led to
                            usable features that were sufficiently generic for the tool to be
                            adopted, also for purposes for which it was not specifically
                            intended</quote>
                        <ptr target="#kemman2015" loc="71"/>
                    </cit>. In an earlier study <ptr target="#tabak2008"/>, I have illustrated how
                    awareness of users' non-purposive information practices can contribute to the
                    successful development of an organisational intranet. This article will argue
                    that management of DH projects could benefit from insights of the
                        <term>information behaviour</term> (IB) studies. </p>
                <p>The significance of projects for DH and their specific features in relation to
                    traditional humanities projects suggest that DH as a discipline should pay more
                    attention to project management, and perhaps to develop the project management
                    models, principles, and methods that are more specific to the discipline.
                    However, Reed points out that managing DH projects is often in practice
                    considered as a <soCalled>soft</soCalled> skill and it is positioned in
                    opposition, or even as competition for funding, with <soCalled>hard</soCalled>
                    skills such as programming and software development <ptr target="#reed2014"/>.
                    She claims that such a distinction on soft and hard skills is a result of
                    difficulties in evaluation of project roles for which a distinction between
                    implicit and explicit skills could be more adequate. The most typical roles in
                    DH projects are technical expertise (we could identify it as D in DH) and
                    subject matter expertise (H in DH). Both roles present much more explicit modes
                    of knowledge than the implicit skills of project management, which as such often
                    go unexamined and under-appreciated from both D-side and H-side of a DH project.
                    Reed notes that even when project management principles are made explicit to DH
                    practitioners, they are usually presented from a beginner’s perspective,
                    offering merely <soCalled>basic principles,</soCalled>
                    <soCalled>tips and tricks,</soCalled> or <soCalled>top-ten lists,</soCalled>
                    seriously simplifying management of DH projects <ptr target="#reed2014"/>. In
                    order to make management of DH projects explicit, this paper will offer a model
                    for managing DH projects, based on insights from information studies and agile
                    project management methods.</p>

                <head>Agile Project Management</head>
                <p>There is something similar in the trajectory of the introduction of the Agile
                    methods in software development and IS design with the trajectory that led to
                    renaming the field of humanities computing to digital humanities at the
                    beginning of this century. A major driver for both trajectories was a
                    dissatisfaction of practitioners from these fields with the treatment of their
                    main target groups: the humanities scholars in DH, and customers in the case of
                    software development. This similarity could be explained by the focus of both
                    areas on development of computing tools. Svensson argues that such an
                    instrumental orientation led the humanities computing to neglect its main target
                    group - the humanities scholars <ptr target="#svensson2009"/>. Renaming
                    humanities computing to digital humanities has shifted the focus from the
                    computing to the humanities, which became the central noun rather than merely an
                    adjective. Almost at the same time, agile methods have been defined by the
                        <title rend="italic">Agile Manifesto</title>
                    <ptr target="#beck2001"/>. According to Abbas et al., only 2 of 12 principles of
                    the Agile Manifesto were relatively new ideas as the <soCalled>Agile
                        ideas</soCalled> have been around since at least 1970’s <ptr target="#abbas2008"/>. Both principles are related to the main target group
                    of software development - the customers. One of these principles proposes that
                    developers should welcome changing requirements for the customer's competitive
                    advantage, while another requires that developers and customers must work
                    together daily throughout the project. This suggests that a major intention of
                    both renaming humanities computing to DH and the Agile Manifesto was to involve
                    users and other stakeholders more explicitly in the project activities.</p>
                <p><title rend="italic">The Agile Manifesto</title> have been proposed as a reaction
                    to the traditional methods in software development, such as the waterfall
                    methodology, which is a sequential design process consisting of several stages:
                    conception, initiation, analysis, design, construction, testing, implementation,
                    and maintenance. Such a sequential process requires that developers can move to
                    the next stage only when a current stage is completed. During 1990s, many
                    practitioners found this linear process frustrating and difficult to implement
                    in the new context of rapid technological change where <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#cohen2004">customers have become increasingly unable to
                            definitively state their needs up front while, at the same time,
                            expecting more from their software</quote>
                        <ptr target="#cohen2004" loc="3"/>
                    </cit>. In such a context, the practitioners tried to develop methods that will
                    respond to this change. In 2001, the representatives of these methodologies
                    defined their common values and principles in the Agile Manifesto,
                    differentiating themselves from traditional methods.</p>
                <p>The manifesto proposes four core values for such methodologies. The Agile Methods
                    value individuals and interactions over processes and tools, working software
                    over comprehensive documentation, customer collaboration over contract
                    negotiation, and responding to change over following a plan. This does not mean
                    that there is no value in tools, documentation, contract negotiation, and
                    planning, but that the focus of these methods are on individuals and
                    interactions, working software, customer collaboration, and response to change.
                    There are 12 core principles of Agile Methods: The highest priority is on the
                    satisfaction of the customer achieved through early and continuous delivery of
                    valuable software. The Agile Methods welcome changing requirements, even late in
                    development, as they harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
                    The working software should be frequently delivered, preferably in the shorter
                    timescale. Customers and developers must work together daily throughout the
                    project. Projects should be built around motivated individuals, who should be
                    empowered. The best communication within a development team is face-to-face
                    conversation. Working software is the primary measure of progress. Agile
                    processes promote sustainable development. Agility is enhanced by technical
                    excellence and good design. Simplicity is essential. For these methods, the best
                    projects emerge from self-organising teams. The team should regularly reflect on
                    how to become more effective, then tune and adjust its behaviour
                    accordingly.</p>
                <p>The Agile Methods are iterative, modular, and incremental. The product is
                    delivered through multiple software increments. The work is usually organised
                    into a <soCalled>backlog</soCalled> of existing requirements. The agile methods
                    are adaptive rather than predictive. They harness changes in requirements, and
                    realise that plans are usually short-lived. They rather focus on customers'
                    scenarios of process, so they rely on use cases and use stories. The most
                    preferred communication is face-to-face meetings, commonly short and frequent.
                    In any case, the active user involvement, feedback and learning are crucial for
                    the agile methods. They all recommend some forms of regular retrospective
                    meetings both within the team and between the team, customers, and other
                    stakeholders. An underlying intention is thus to involve the stakeholders more
                    directly in development.</p>
                <p>The agile methods are organised in stages or phases, similar to the processes in
                    other software development methodologies, such as planning, management,
                    evaluation, and control of iterative and incremental processes. However, these
                    processes are designed specifically to cope with rapid change, team empowerment,
                    and active stakeholder involvement. The teams are small and self-organised, so
                    that decisions can be made faster. Most of the agile methods use time-boxing, a
                    planning technique, where the schedule is divided into a number of separate time
                    periods so that each period can have its own deliverables, deadline, and budget.
                    In Scrum method, for example, the work occurs in a <soCalled>sprint</soCalled>
                    (a time-box between 2 and 6 weeks). The focus is on frequent delivery of
                    products or features of the final products. In the Feature Driven Development, a
                    feature is conceptualised as a client-valued function that can be implemented in
                    two weeks or so. Such a modular and incremental approach is a most common
                    characteristic of the life-cycle of different agile methods. While all agile
                    methods are based on the common values and principles, each of them has its own
                    software development life cycle <ptr target="#bhalerao2009"/>. Table 1
                    represents some of the agile methods with the proposed iterative stages in the
                    life-cycle of an agile project, and the main features of each method.</p>

                <p>While these stages of different agile methods could be easily conceptualised into
                    a general framework with typical stages in any project (such as planning,
                    development, evaluation, and deployment), the terminology of a particular agile
                    method is not a trivial issue. The naming of stages as visioning, speculating,
                    innovating, collaborating, or learning stresses the significance of specific
                    features of agile projects such as adaptive planning, extensive collaboration,
                    constant learning, incremental development, and modularity. These features are
                    also common to DH research projects. Project-based scholarship of DH differs
                    from traditional scholarship in being experimental, team-based, iterative and
                    ongoing, rather than fixed or final, in its outcome, involving <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#burdick2012">many dimensions of conception, design, coordination,
                            and resource use that build extra layers of complexity onto the

                        <ptr target="#burdick2012" loc="130"/>
                    </cit>. Dyba et al. claim that agile project management is particularly
                    appropriate for managing such complexity and uncertainty <ptr target="#dyba2014"/>.</p>
                <p>This suggests that we could easily adapt iterative cycles of an agile method, for
                    example Flexible Project Management framework <ptr target="#decarlo2004"/>, to
                    define the cycles of a typical DH project. The framework starts with the
                    Visionate cycle, which identifies the project objectives, benefits and risks, as
                    well as possible future scenarios, producing a collective vision of the project
                    and its deliverables. The Speculate cycle defines a plan for interim
                    deliverables and milestones, however tentative these may be. The focus of
                    Innovate cycle is on rapid development and real-time feedback loops. The work
                    during this cycle takes place within a series of time boxes, usually one to six
                    weeks. The Reevaluate cycle is a series of "learning" iteration, in which a
                    decision is made about the future course of the project. Since in an agile
                    project management, the goal is not to produce the planned but rather the
                    desired result, what we are <cit>

                    </cit>. Finally, the Disseminate stage is about publishing the project
                    deliverables, but it includes also maintenance, so it is important to <cit>

                <p>We can identify these stages in many DH projects. A DH project starts with a
                    vision that identifies the project objectives, benefits and risks. DH projects
                    are iterative, modular, and incremental, in the same way as agile projects. For
                    this reason, it is important to speculate in order to define a plan for interim
                    deliverables and milestones of a DH project. The naming of the next cycle as
                        <soCalled>innovate</soCalled> rather than <soCalled>develop</soCalled> cycle
                    is also appropriate for a DH project as a scholarly project. The process of
                    reevaluation, defined as a series of learning iteration, is even more crucial
                    for a DH project. Both innovation and evaluation cycles require constant
                    learning and real-time feedback loops. While both in agile and DH projects, the
                    goal is not to produce the planned but rather the desired result, the outcomes
                    of a DH research project are more unpredictable. The continuous cycles of
                    planning, de-planning, and re-planning are thus even more frequent in DH
                    projects. Finally, the name of the dissemination stage could not be more
                    appropriate for the final stage of a DH project. Moreover, this stage in the
                    Flexible Project Management framework refers not only to publishing of the
                    project deliverables, but it also include maintenance, which addresses an
                    important issue in DH practices that <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#reed2014">tend to focus heavily on project planning rather than
                            project management</quote>
                        <ptr target="#reed2014"/>
                    </cit>. </p>
                <p>However, there are several issues, which prevent some aspects of agile project
                    management to be easily translated into DH research projects. The agile methods
                    assume that there is a customer on the other side waiting for a product to be
                    used, while in a DH project, there is a researcher constantly creating research
                    questions rather than a list of features to be implemented <ptr target="#bezerra2014"/>. To be used in a DH project, agile methods should be
                    adapted to such an exploratory innovative research environment, in which each
                    single iteration leads to new insights, and thus to changing not only users'
                    requirements but also perspectives and aims of the project <ptr target="#vanzundert2012"/>. Way et al. argue that the customer orientation
                    of most agile methodologies requires the most adaptation <ptr target="#way2009"/>. They claim that the most significant factors that contrast an academic
                    research project that involves software development (which is a typical DH
                    project) with an industry software development project are variability of
                    schedule and unpredictability of progress in academic settings. In addition, the
                    customer orientation of the agile methods conceptualises their main target group
                    as users, while the main target group in DH are the humanities scholars, who
                    were supposed to be not only users but also co-creators of DH tools <ptr target="#svensson2009"/>. This suggests that an adoption of an agile project
                    management to DH projects should also address some limitations of user-centred
                    approach of the agile methods.</p>
                <p>The issue of the variability of schedule in academic settings could be easily
                    addressed by simply modifying some concept from agile project management to be
                    compatible with a research environment. For instance, Bezerra et al. propose
                        <term>ARDev</term> (Agile Research Development), a methodology to support
                    research management, based on Scrum principles <ptr target="#bezerra2014"/>. The
                    methodology provides a valuable modification of the Scrum roles and work
                    products in a context of research project management, which, to some extent,
                    addresses the issues of variability of schedule in academic settings. The four
                    roles in ARDev are Research Starter, ARDev Master, Research Team, and
                    Stakeholders, corresponding to the main roles in Scrum: Project Owner, Scrum
                    Master, Scrum Team, and Stakeholders. Work products are defined as results of
                    the research activities, and include: technical report of the research project,
                    list of research tasks per iteration, research block list, research iteration
                    planning meeting, research iteration review, research iteration retrospective,
                    and regular meeting. Another methodology that adapted Scrum to research
                    management also addresses the issue of the academic schedule. Hicks and Foster
                    propose the SCORE (Scrum for Research) methodology, in which the Scrum meeting
                    structure has been adopted to academic settings, resulting in improved research
                    group identity and productivity <ptr target="#hicks2010"/>. The model, described
                    in the last section of this paper, will propose similar modifications of roles
                    and work products in DH projects.</p>
                <p>The second issue in adopting agile project management to DH projects is
                    unpredictability of progress in DH research projects. Way et al. point our that
                    research projects involve a constant redefinition of requirements as new
                    research findings often lead to new definitions of the original goals <ptr target="#way2009"/>. Such unpredictability of the progress of a project
                    makes the research process inherently unsuitable for an agile project management
                    methodology. However, they claim that despite this unpredictability, the core
                    values and principles of agile methods can be adapted and applied to research
                    projects, and propose the <soCalled>Agile Research Penultimatum,</soCalled> an
                    attempt to adopt these values and principles to a research settings. The most
                    notable is the adoption of the agile principle stating that the simplicity is
                    essential. They suggest that while simplicity is still essential in a research
                    project, a recognition that complex problems often require complex solution is
                    even more essential. The false simplicity should not be a shortcut for avoiding
                    perplexity, which is often a departure point for any research, in particular for
                    the humanities research. Therefore, a model for managing DH projects should
                    harness both change and perplexity. This could be achieved by making
                    retrospective evaluation as a constant process within each cycle of DH project
                    instead of treating it as a separate cycle, which will be discussed in the final
                    section of the paper.</p>
                <p>However, a greater issue for adopting agile project management to a DH project is
                    a suggested higher degree of involvement of the stakeholders as co–creators in
                    DH project than in a typical software development project. The humanities
                    scholars as the main stakeholders of DH projects are considered not only as
                    users but also as co–creators <ptr target="#svensson2012"/>. Although the aim of
                    agile methods is to involve the stakeholders in development of the product, the
                    customers are rather conceptualised as users than co–creators of the product.
                    The main techniques for involving the customers in development include modelling
                    user requirements, use cases, and user stories. While such a user–centred
                    approach may offer a more effective framework for a typical DH project than
                    traditional project management methods, it still brings technological
                    instrumentality, which is more appropriate for humanities computing than DH
                    projects. Gasson argues that the most user–centred approaches in IS design,
                    including the agile methods, focus on <soCalled>closing down</soCalled> a
                    technology–centred and goal–directed IS problem, rather than on
                        <soCalled>opening up</soCalled> the social and organisational context to
                    examination <ptr target="#gasson2003"/>. She claims that even in an agile
                    approach, which is a worthwhile attempt to deal with misunderstandings between
                    technical designers and users, the design problems usually remain unexamined
                    after they are determined early in the project. Although an agile approach
                    provides techniques that may generate new system requirements and goals during
                    the life of the project, <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#gasson2003">it does not question the essential form and social role
                            of the technical system, as even this approach focuses on an individual

                        <ptr target="#gasson2003" loc="39"/>
                    </cit>. For this reason, she proposes a human-centred approach, and offers a
                    model with two cycles of the design process in order to to deal
                        <soCalled>separately but interactively</soCalled> with system inquiry and
                    implementation. During the first cycle — the cycle of inquiry – the stakeholders
                    develop a shared understanding, as a result of the negotiation and development
                    of a common worldview, which allows them to move to the second cycle–the
                    implementation cycle–driven by the goals defined in the first cycle. The model
                    emphases such a dialectical process, which should achieve a balance between the
                    common worldview of stakeholders and the closure of predetermined, technical
                    problems.</p>
                <p>Balancing between the digital (technical problems) and the humanities
                    (stakeholders) is a significant issue in DH discipline, and perhaps a major
                    reason for renaming humanities computing into digital humanities. This renaming
                    aimed to invite traditional humanities scholars to embrace digital technology,
                    as DH was defined as <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#svensson2012">a part of the humanities not so much in the sense of

                    </cit>. Gasson's model is based on a similar assumption of incompatibility
                    between social and technological. She proposes that two incommensurable worlds
                    of socio-cultural work and technology-interaction cannot be analysed with common
                    methods, but we <cit>

                <p>However, separating solution design (technological innovation) from problem
                    investigation (research questions) would only further separate D–side from
                    H–side of DH, making them two incommensurable worlds. Instead, this paper takes
                    an Actor–Network Theory (ANT) approach that argues for methodological symmetry,
                    advocating the use of the same type of analysis for all elements of network
                    whether they are natural, technological, or social. A single explanatory
                    framework should be used for interpretation of actors, both humans and
                    non–humans <ptr target="#callon1986a"/>. By eliminating the human/non–human
                    binaries, ANT enables technological artefacts to act, move and speak <ptr target="#kim2005" loc="169"/>. An actor is not just a point object or a
                    placeholder <ptr target="#latour2005"/>, but it is an association of
                    heterogeneous elements, so that each actor is also a simplified network <ptr target="#law1992"/>. The concept of actor–network should be seen as a term
                    that is intentionally oxymoronic, embedding a tension between the centred actor
                    and the decentred network–it <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#law1999">is thus a way of performing both an elision and a

                <p>ANT approach offers an alternative to the user–centred approach in information
                    studies by extending agency to non–humans, but also by focusing on relations
                    between entities rather than on entities themselves. A constant shifting and
                    positioning between two main tenets of the user–centred approach in IB
                    field–centrality of the user and the essential role of context in information
                    practices–has become a differentiation point for contemporary IB theories, but
                    also the main difficulty in tracing information practices <ptr target="#tabak2014"/>. On the other hand, ANT ignores both human/technology
                    and cognitive/social divide: the information practices are conceptualised as
                    simultaneous and continuous circulation of exchanging properties between
                    heterogenous entities. Such a conceptualisation offers a relational approach to
                    information practices, in which information and users, individual and
                    collective, humans and non-humans, cosmos and politics, constantly exchange
                    properties. Information Cosmopolitics model <ptr target="#tabak2015"/> has been
                    proposed to describe information practices as the circulation of hybrid entities
                    continuously exchanging properties in the process of composing a collective,
                    which is constantly redefined by the circulation.</p>
                <p>A model for managing DH projects, proposed in the final section of this paper,
                    will combine Information Cosmopolitics model with the iterative stages of
                    Flexible Project Management <ptr target="#decarlo2004"/>, an agile project
                    management framework. The model will provide the means for dealing with the
                    issues that prevent some aspects of agile project management to be easily
                    translated into DH research projects. In order to address issue of variability
                    of schedule in academic environments, the model will modify definition of roles
                    and work products of agile methods to be specific to DH research projects. The
                    second issue in adopting agile methods to DH projects–unpredictability of
                    progress–will be addressed by using evaluation as a constant process within the
                    all iterative cycles of the model. This will enable a progressive and
                    incremental cycle of creative uncertainties and their provisional closures,
                    presented through the modular deliverables. Finally, in order to avoid
                    technological instrumentalism and to balance the D–side and H–side of DH
                    projects, Information Cosmopolitics, an ANT approach to information practices,
                    will be employed to describe the processes in DH projects as a continuous
                    circulation in which digital technology and the humanities constantly exchange
                    properties.</p>

                    <ptr target="#tabak2015"/> is a model of information practices, based on
                    actor-network theory <ptr target="#latour2005"/>, and findings from a field
                    study investigating information sharing practices in academic communities. The
                    concept of cosmopolitics was borrowed from Isabelle Stengers <ptr target="#stengers2005"/> to describe a continuous circulation in which
                    information and users, individual and collective, humans and non-humans, cosmos
                    and politics, constantly exchange properties. A single cycle of the circulation
                    consists of several consequential moments, necessary to perform the circulation
                    (Figure 1). Each cycle starts with the perplexity brought by in-scription of
                    collective propositions into information objects, which are then translated to
                    individual propositions through the process of de-scription. The next moment of
                    contextualisation provides an interface between individual and collective
                    propositions. Finally, standardisation enables transformation of local
                    de-scriptions into collectively accepted propositions, providing a closure to
                    the initial perplexity. However, the closure is always provisional as each
                    proposition is another invitation to perplexity.</p>

                        placed in institutions such as libraries, archives, museums, and distributed
                        through different media such as print, videos, and the Internet. But we
                        often deal with them in our everyday life. For example, a speed bump on a
                        street is an information object with an inscribed message from a police
                        department which asks drivers to slow down <ptr target="#latour1987"/>.
                        In-scription is a process when an entity <cit>
                            <quote rend="inline" source="#latour1999b">becomes materialized into a sign, an archive, a
                                document, a piece of paper, a trace</quote>
                            <ptr target="#latour1999b" loc="306"/>
                        </cit>. An information object is thus anything that leaves a trace, which
                        could be retraced, translated, de-scribed. Such a trace often leaves an
                        actor in a state of perplexity: Where has the trace come from? How can it be
                        retraced? Can I translate it to my language? Is it relevant to me? How can I
                        de-scribe this in-scription? This kind of perplexity is the starting point
                        of information cosmopolitics. While information objects are in-scribed with
                        implicit propositions for a generic individual, a specific individual has to
                        translate the implicit propositions into explicitly relevant information in
                        order to navigate the situation. Therefore, for a generic body to become a
                        fully individualised actor dealing with a specific situation, a proposition
                        in-scribed into an information object has to be de-scribed.</p>

                    <p>Information is always transformation, a de-scription of information object.
                        In order for inscription to be informing, actors need to translate
                        information objects in their own terms. Actors approve or reject
                        propositions in-scribed into information objects. They individualise
                        collective propositions according to their own methodology, making them
                        relevant or not. This individualisation transforms a user from a generic
                        body to an actor. This is why the existence of a collective, an institution,
                        or a cosmos is in the hand of local users <ptr target="#latour1987"/> – in
                        the hand of local representations, as there is no reality without
                        representation <ptr target="#latour2004b" loc="127"/>. In order to
                        illustrate that individuals are neither in control, nor out of control,
                        Latour uses the web term plug-in as a conceptual tool. He intentionally uses
                        a web metaphor to illustrate that individuals can download a plug-in from an
                        institution, which will provide them with a temporary competence for a
                        specific situation <ptr target="#latour2005"/>. By downloading some cultural
                        clichés, individuals are provided with competencies to create an opinion of
                        a book, to have a political stance, or to know to which group they pertain.
                        Someone is an individual only if she or he has been individualised by
                        downloading these <soCalled>individualizers</soCalled> from the outside.
                        However, the outside is not a global context which determines the inside,
                        but it is another local place to which an actor can be plugged-in. Plug-ins
                        do not have the power to determine, they can simply make someone do
                        something, and making do is not the same as causing, dominating, or
                        limiting. De-scription is thus a process of "trans-forming" rather than
                            <soCalled>in-forming</soCalled> an actor <ptr target="#latour1998"/>.
                        Rather than seeing actors as limited to their own description, their social
                        or cognitive representation of the external world, information cosmopolitics
                        approaches de-scription of an in-scription as rebuilding the cosmos. Through
                        this transformation, an actor attributes to another actor <cit>
                            <quote rend="inline" source="#callon1986b">identity, interests, a role to play, a course of

                    <head>Contextualisation</head>
                    <p>Contextualisation provides a common language for heterogeneous entities.
                        Nothing links humans, non-humans, different domains of interests, different
                        times and spaces, like a context. Linked by a common context, each of these
                        entities depends on each other. They become combinable and commensurable.
                        However, actors are not placed into this context, but attached to it. The
                        context and its significance is created by actors. Individual
                        interpretations are put in <soCalled>big picture</soCalled> in attempt to
                        become significant for others. This frequently creates new information needs
                        or changes priority of existing information needs, effecting circulation in
                        consequent cycles. As the configuration of plug-ins is slightly changed by
                        this prioritising, the individual identity is slightly changing too; thus
                        the information is not de-scribed by the exactly the same individual, nor it
                        is contextualised into exactly the same context, in every subsequent cycle.
                        Therefore, the moment of contextualisation could be a departure point for
                        all kinds of <soCalled>serendipity</soCalled>
                        <ptr target="#pettigrew1999"/>, and as such it is perhaps the most creative
                        moment in the circulation providing the maximum possible combinations of
                        propositions. Contextualisation allows <cit>

                        Information cosmopolitics is not an attempt to put miraculously everyone in
                        agreement <ptr target="#stengers2005"/>. It is neither about equality of
                        actors, but it is about making them all <cit>
                            <quote rend="inline" source="#stengers2005">to be present in the mode that makes the decision

                        decision of inclusion and exclusion. It provides actors to be commensurable
                        by attaching them to the same context, before some information is excluded
                        and other standardised.</p>

                    <head>Standardisation</head>
                    <p>Standardisation is a process through which information is articulated into a
                        collective proposition. Provisional closure to the initial perplexity is
                        provided by assigning an essence to the information through negotiations.
                        What was an object of perplexity becomes the object of an agreement. Some
                        information are standardised, some are excluded during these processes that
                        produce the inside and the outside of the circulation through which a
                        collective – a cosmos – is provided with a shape, size, and collective
                        identity, represented through collective propositions. Once the propositions
                        are standardised, the actors <cit>
                            <quote rend="inline" source="#latour2004b">no longer question their legitimate presence at the

                        </cit>. This move from context to standards is a move from a generic to a
                        specific collective, a move from flexibility to certainty. While
                        contextualisation provides diversity that enables commensurability,
                        standardisation enables a hierarchy that provides unity. However, collective
                        propositions can only gain stability in a constant circulation. In fact,
                        they are recreated and translated in every single cycle of information
                        cosmopolitics. While a dramatic change is always possible with a sudden
                        introduction of an external in-scription, most changes are subtle but
                        regular. Each cycle of the circulation is a new trial of credibility of a
                        collective proposition. It is important to note that such circulation of
                        negotiation does not produce statements but propositions. To paraphrase
                        Latour, there is a great difference between talking about information
                        practices <cit>
                            <quote rend="inline" source="#latour2004b">if one uses propositions (which are articulate or
                                inarticulate) instead of statements (which are true or

                        </cit>. The difference could not be sharper as statements refer to accuracy,
                        and propositions are the result of articulation. While a quest for accuracy
                        ignores negotiations, and as such paralyses circulation of information
                        cosmopolitics, articulation is almost a synonym for cosmopolitics in which
                        heterogeneous entities exchange properties in a constant negotiation. As
                        such, collective propositions provide a local, thus manageable, totality,
                        which in turn provides a closure for initial perplexity.</p>

                    <head>Invitation to Perplexity</head>
                    <p>However, such a closure is always provisional as through a new inscription
                        new perplexity is invited. Figure 1 of the model does not illustrate the
                        full integration of information into collective proposition, but rather only
                        one cycle of this slow transformation. Each new piece of information goes
                        through this process. If it is excluded before it is articulated into a
                        proposition, it can still be in-scribed later when a new configuration of
                        circulation is more favourable. Any excluded information is a new
                        possibility in a new cycle, and every accepted proposition is regularly
                        re-inscribed in a new information object in order to be as durable as
                        possible. What was insignificant information in one cycle can be crucial
                        information in another one. Information is not itself significant or
                        insignificant, but it gains significant position in the circulation. It is
                        translated in every moment of the circulation of information cosmopolitics.
                        However, these transformations are not abrupt modifications but rather
                        subtle changes, limited by the boundaries of the network. Actors could
                        de-scribe an in-scription only within the limits of the in-scription and
                        availability of plug-ins used for de-scription. Contextualisation is limited
                        by already established standards in the network, and durability of
                        propositions is dependent on the immutability and mobility of in-scriptions.
                        As subtle as they are, these transformations still slightly modify the
                        configuration of associations within the circulation. As a result, a new
                        cycle brings a need for new plug-ins, which slightly changes individual
                        identities, new priorities are created that slightly change context, and
                        standards are slightly changed creating a need for new in-scriptions. All
                        this creates new information needs and new perplexity, which feed the
                        constant circulation of information cosmopolitics.</p>

                    <p>By shifting the focus from individual mind and social context to this
                        circulation, Information Cosmopolitics provides an alternative to the
                        existing IB models. Knowledge is not seen as cognitive or social, but as
                        distributed. The model suggests that individual and social are provisional
                        effects of individualisation and collectivisation, and as such they cannot
                        be used to explain information practices. Both individual and collective are
                        merely moments of information cosmopolitics, connected by scripts that
                        circulate between them. In one moment, the collective is scripted by the
                        individual, only to script the individual next moment. These sequential
                        events of exchanging properties between individual and collective is what
                        keeps the circulation of information cosmopolitics, and what enables both
                        diversity of individual associations and their unification into a common
                        world — a cosmos, constantly redefined by the circulation. Following these
                        events may illuminate how users translate information to be relevant to
                        their interests, how they contextualise their individual propositions to
                        evaluate them in order to be accepted by a collective, how the collective
                        propositions are re-inscribed into information objects, and how the new
                        digital inscription creates a new perplexity that triggers a new cycle of
                        information practices.</p>

                        <p>An agile project is organised around self-managing, cross-functional
                            teams, working on a functional increment, a feature, or a product in a
                            short iteration time-box. In Scrum, major roles in projects are defined
                            as Product Owner, Scrum Master, and team members. A Product Owner is an
                            intermediary between customers and the team, who define and prioritise
                            the backlog of tasks, help elaborate those tasks with the team, and
                            accept the completed tasks. The product backlog is the list of all the
                            tasks that need to be done in the project. The tasks are ranked and
                            organised in smaller groups of tasks to be accomplished within a
                            time-box, which is in Scrum defined as a sprint. The Product Owner is
                            responsible for both product backlog and sprint backlog. Another role in
                            Scrum is a Scrum Master, who is responsible for providing the team
                            members with all the resources necessary to accomplish their tasks, to
                            facilitate the team interactions and meetings, and to ensure regular
                            progress. Finally, the team members are specialists working on the
                            tasks. </p>
                        <p>In order to develop an agile methodology to support research management,
                            Bezerra et al. introduce the ARDev model, in which they modify the Scrum
                            roles into Research Starter, ARDev Master, and Research Team <ptr target="#bezerra2014"/>. Research Starter, corresponding to the
                            Product Owner in Scrum, is responsible for directing and monitoring
                            research progress. While the Product Owner defines sprint backlog and
                            prioritises user stories in a product backlog, Research Starter defines
                            research items (research stories) into list of the research tasks per
                            iteration and prioritises them in a research block list. ARDev Master
                            manages the research process, keeps the team focused on the current
                            task, and remove obstacle of research. Research Team is responsible for
                            delivering research artefacts at the end of each research iteration. </p>
                        <p>While such a modification of work roles in a research project is more
                            appropriate for DH projects than the proposed Scrum work roles, DH
                            projects are more complex than a traditional humanities research
                            project. Burdick et al. point out that DH projects involve multiple
                            strata of personnel from a principal investigator to project advisors,
                            IT staff, the humanities scholars, and students. As such, they all <cit>
                                <quote rend="inline" source="#burdick2012">have technical, administrative, and
                                    intellectual aspects to their production</quote>
                                <ptr target="#burdick2012" loc="132"/>
                            </cit>. The hybrid model proposes that any DH project must include three
                            basic roles: a role that corresponds to the digital aspects of DH,
                            another one related to the humanities aspects of DH, and a role that
                            combine both digital and humanistic aspects of a DH project. For the
                            purpose of the model, these core roles in DH projects are defined as: </p>
                        <list type="unordered">
                            <item>D-role, </item>
                            <item>H-role, and </item>
                            <item>DH-role.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The roles are based on the core competencies in processes and methods
                            required by DH projects <ptr target="#burdick2012"/>. The D-role deals
                            with the technical aspects of DH projects, which include specific
                            competencies for doing DH work such as web development, infrastructure,
                            server environment, interface design, choices about tools, platforms,
                            software, and hardware. The H-role provides the content, the most
                            visible intellectual aspect of DH projects. This role enables the
                            fundamental humanistic values and perspectives to take a central part of
                            a DH project. Without the D-role, a DH project might not fully benefit
                            from digital technology; without the H-role, there is a danger to
                            neglect the main target group of DH project — the humanities scholars. The
                            major responsibility of the DH-role is to provide the balance between
                            digital (technical) and humanistic (intellectual) aspects of DH
                            projects. While H-role provides the content for a project, Burdick et
                            al. point out that DH projects <cit>
                                <quote rend="inline" source="#burdick2012">present arguments and knowledge experiments in
                                    many different ways, often contributing to the creation of new

                                    data structures, and even code</quote>

                            </cit>. They propose that core intellectual competencies for a DH
                            projects are cross-cultural communication, generative imagination, and
                            iterative and lateral thinking. The DH-role should be able to align
                            these competencies with both digital and humanistic aspects of DH
                            projects. </p>
                        <p>The focus of different DH projects can vary from designing a simple
                            digital repository to a complex modes of distance reading and cultural
                            analytics. Different projects will require different competencies. The
                            projects also come in different sizes. They can be as large as
                            international and multidisciplinary projects involving a number of
                            institutions, but they can be as small as a project involving a single
                            researcher, working on a specific issue. However, they all need to
                            involve the three core roles of DH projects. A project member can play
                            more than a single role, and in the smallest projects, a single member
                            will be required to play all three roles. The name of these roles is not
                            important as long as they refer to digital, humanistic, and DH aspects
                            of DH projects. Similarly, while it is possible to use the terms
                            Research Starter or Product Owner, depending of the project focus, this
                            model will rather use the term Principal Investigator (PI) as it
                            includes other than merely intellectual (research) or merely
                            technological (digital) aspects of a DH project. This also implies that
                            a DH-role is the most appropriate to take the role of PI because the PI
                            role deals not only with administrative but also with technical and
                            intellectual aspects of the project. The responsibility of the PI in a
                            DH project is <cit>

                            between the actors in DH projects, adapted from Scrum:</p>

                        <p>In Scrum, the role of the Product Owner is to collate the stakeholders'
                            inputs into a <soCalled>backlog</soCalled> of requirements. The backlog
                            consists of all the project tasks, ranked in priority order. A sub-set
                            of the product backlog is taken by the team to be completed within a
                            short duration milestone, called a sprint. This sub-set of the product
                            backlog that the team commits to complete within a sprint is called the
                            Sprint backlog. This model will use the terms project backlog and
                            milestone backlog to refer to similar project management tools because
                            it will not use a sprint for time-boxing nor a DH project is not
                            necessary a product-oriented project. The project backlog consists of
                            all the project milestones, while the milestone backlog refers to the
                            tasks to which the team is committed while working on a milestone.</p>
                        <p>In order to facilitate team communication, Scrum employs a series of
                            meetings, known as ceremonies, including sprint planning, daily scrum,
                            sprint review, and sprint retrospective. Sprint planning refers to a
                            comprehensive meeting that defines what needs to be done by the end of
                            the sprint. The daily scrum is a short meeting of no more than 15
                            minutes, in which each member of the team provides a very short answers
                            to the questions: What I did yesterday? What I plan to do today? What is
                            in my way (or what is blocking my progress)? The Sprint review provides
                            a feedback on a demo of the working software that the team has built,
                            which helps the team validate that they are on the right track. The
                            sprint retrospective enable the team to reflect upon the previous sprint
                            in order to learn some lessons and then adjusts their work or the
                            environment so that they improve their work. This model uses the regular
                            meetings instead of daily scrum meetings in order to accommodate to
                            different work schedules of team members in a DH project, while the
                            milestone planning and milestone retrospective correspond to the sprint
                            planning and sprint retrospective. The milestones are defined in the
                            project plan, and they are related to the project outcomes. </p>

                        </list>
                        <p>They corresponds to four phases in the proposed lifecycle of a project
                            (visionate, speculate, innovate, and disseminate), which are discussed
                            in the next section. A vision type of project outcome is a departure
                            point for a DH project. The main outcome of this stage is the project
                            vision document, which defines aims, objectives, the main stakeholders,
                            and expected benefits of the project. The vision document may also
                            (although roughly) estimate timing, human resources and budget. The main
                            outcome of the speculate-stage is the project plan, which defines the
                            project milestones, estimates required resources to accomplish each
                            milestone, identifies project risks, and present the contingency plan.
                            In this stage, the project plan does not include the tasks necessary to
                            accomplish a milestone, which will be added during milestone planning
                            meetings within the innovate-stage. The main outcome of the
                            innovate-stage is a prototype. The term prototype is used here rather in
                            an engineering sense that refers to a first instance of a product to be
                            tested (and refined if necessary) just before the final product is
                            launched. In this model, a prototype refers to an instance of a project
                            deliverable that needs to be tested (and refined if necessary) before it
                            is disseminated. This might be a fully functional prototype of a digital
                            tool or a draft of an academic manuscript that needs some editing. After
                            testing and evaluation, a prototype is translated into a deliverable,
                            which is a major outcome of the disseminate stage.</p>

                    <p>An adopted cycle of Information Cosmopolitics model and stages of the
                        Flexible Project Management framework are combined into a hybrid model for
                        managing DH projects. The model proposes that the lifecycle of a DH project
                        consists of a constant circulation of information cosmopolitics, in which an
                        iteration starts with a perplexity and ends with a provisional closure,
                        in-scribed into a work outcome. A progressive flow of a DH project is
                        adopted from the Flexible Project Management framework, which identifies
                        five steps in an agile project: Visionate, Speculate, Innovate, Reevaluate,
                        and Disseminate. As the processes of evaluation are already incorporated
                        within the circulation of information cosmopolitics, the proposed model
                        defines the lifecycle of a DH project to be a progressive flow in four
                        stages: </p>
                    <list type="unordered">
                        <item>Visionate, </item>
                        <item>Speculate, </item>
                        <item>Innovate, and </item>
                        <item>Disseminate. </item>
                    </list>
                    <p>The process of evaluation is considered as a constant activity rather than a
                        stage in the project lifecycle. The individual evaluation refers to
                        de-scription process in information cosmopolitics cycle, while a collective
                        evaluation is related to the standardisation process. The four progressive
                        stages are defined by progressive work outcomes, conducted in four
                        progressive work contexts: visionate-context, speculate-context,
                        innovate-context, and disseminate-context. The visionate-stage results in
                        the project vision; the speculate-stage in the project plan; the
                        innovate-stage results in a prototype; while a deliverable is a work outcome
                        of disseminate-stage. Figure 2 illustrates the lifecycle of a DH project,
                        according to the hybrid model.</p>

                    </figure>
                    <p>Each cycle starts with encountering a work outcome by a team member. First,
                        the team members de-scribe an existing work outcome (vision, plan,
                        prototype, or deliverable), according to their own interests and relevance
                        criteria, which results in their individual propositions. In order to make
                        an individual proposition relevant to other actors in the project, a team
                        member has to place this proposition in a work context, corresponding to the
                        four work stages of the project. Work contexts include the work on
                        visioning, speculating, innovating, and disseminating. Once the individual
                        proposition is in a particular context, it becomes commensurable with other
                        propositions within the project. As such, the individual proposition is a
                        subject to standardisation, that is a collective evaluation. Some
                        propositions are accepted and some are rejected during this process. The
                        accepted propositions are transformed into collective propositions, and they
                        are finally in-scribed into a work outcome, normally into a work outcome
                        corresponding to the context to which the proposition has been attached in
                        the current cycle. </p>
                    <p>In a linear progressive flow, this circulation through a context and its
                        corresponding work outcome is repeated as long as a milestone is not
                        reached. A milestone refers to in-scription of the final collective
                        proposition within a context, which allows the project to move to the next
                        context. It means that when the final collective proposition within the
                        visionate-context is in-scribed into the project vision document, a
                        milestone is reached, which enables the project to move to the
                        speculate-context. Reaching the milestone within the speculate-context will
                        move the project to innovate-context, while a milestone within
                        innovate-context will enable dissemination of a deliverable. However, the
                        progress of a project is not necessary a linear process. For example,
                        collective evaluation of an individual proposition attached to the
                        innovate-context can result in reconsidering the project plan, or even the
                        project vision, which may require a complex negotiation within the project.
                        The more a proposition deviates from the linear flow of the project, the
                        more difficult is to in-scribe it into a project outcome. And a deviation
                        from a linear progressive flow of a DH project can occur at any moment, as
                        we will see in the following discussion of stages in the project
                        lifecycle.</p>
                    <div>
                        <head>A project idea</head>
                        <p>The very first iteration of the project lifecycle can start with an idea
                            occurring merely in an individual mind. The relevance of this idea is
                            evaluated by the individual, and then attached to any context
                            (visionate, speculate, innovate, or disseminate). In this stage,
                            anything can be a trigger for developing a project, from a general aim
                            to make a knowledge contribution to a wish to deliver an outcome for
                            personal benefits. However, in order to translate an idea into a project
                            vision, the idea has to be collectively evaluated, even if it means
                            virtually in an individual mind. At this stage, this
                                <soCalled>virtual</soCalled> collective can be anything from an
                            academic specialty to the general public. Through the process of
                            standardisation, an individual compares the idea with standards of this
                            collective to evaluate its possible value for others before the idea is
                            in-scribed into a rough draft of a project vision. This first instance
                            of a project vision, which may be as short as a sentence, is a starting
                            point for a number of iterations through visionate-context, leading to a
                            formal vision document.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <head>A project vision</head>
                        <p>The initial idea for a DH project commonly comes from an individual who
                            can take a DH-role in a project, or someone who may play the role of PI
                            in the project. However, this idea may come from an H-role, proposing a
                            traditional humanistic topic, or a D-role, offering a simple computer
                            code for text manipulation without a clear vision of possible benefits
                            for the humanities. In any case, for a research project to become a DH
                            project, it is crucial to involve both digital and humanistic aspects of
                            a DH project from its very inception. The idea in-scribed into the first
                            instance of a project vision is presented to at least the three main
                            roles in a DH project (D-role, H-role, and DH-role) through a set of
                            iterations. Each iteration starts with de-scription of the initial
                            in-scription of the project vision. An individual proposition is then
                            placed in the visionate-context, to be collectively evaluated and
                            translated into a collective proposition. Finally, this collective
                            proposition is in-scribed into a vision document. The formal vision
                            document will define at least its most important elements: the aim of
                            the project, its objectives, the expected deliverables and benefits, the
                            main stakeholders, technical and human requirements, and estimated
                            timing and budgets. Definition of each element requires a minimum of
                            three iterations, each iteration addressing one of the three main roles
                            in a DH project. </p>
                        <p>For instance, an idea can come from a D-role, proposing a computer code
                            manipulating Google maps. In the first iteration, a DH-role may
                            de-scribe this idea into a possible delivery of the project in the form
                            of <soCalled>deep maps.</soCalled> The vision of this deliverable may be
                            de-scribed by a H-role in the next iteration into an objective of the
                            project to map spreading a cultural concept through time and space. In
                            the third iteration, a D-role may de-scribe deep mapping of a cultural
                            concept as a possibility to use specific media in the project, which
                            will be in-scribed into a new objective, deliverable, or into new
                            estimation of requirements and budget in the project vision document. </p>
                        <p>There is an infinite number of possible outcomes of such iterations,
                            which is not possible to anticipate by a model. It is up to a PI and
                            other project stakeholders to make a decision when it is time to scope
                            the project and to draft the formal project vision document. When such a
                            decision is made, the PI starts a new set of iterations to define the
                            scope of project. This process also requires the minimum three
                            iterations for each main role, so that both digital and humanistic
                            aspects of a DH project are considered. The final outcome of this
                            process — the project vision document — is the first milestone in the
                            project. As a milestone is defined as a final collective proposition
                            within a context, the final agreement about the project vision document
                            within this stage enables the project to move to the
                            speculate-stage.</p>

                        <head>Speculating a project plan</head>
                        <p>The main outcome of the speculate stage is the project plan. While the
                            name of the main outcome of this stage suggests an order in this
                            process, the naming of the process as speculation suggests flexibility
                            and adaptability of the process. Failure to plan and schedule an agile
                            project can send the project into chaos, while over-planning can make
                            team members prisoners of the plan, disabling the project <cit>
                                <quote rend="inline" source="#decarlo2004">from initiating or effectively responding to

                            </cit>. The aim of the speculate stage in this model is to identify the
                            project milestones rather than planning the detailed tasks. While in
                            traditional approaches, planning is seen as a distinct project stage
                            with a large up-front effort, the speculate stage in this hybrid model
                            is defined as <cit>
                                <quote rend="inline" source="#chin2004">a moderate up-front effort followed by lower
                                    level but constant updates</quote>

                            </cit> in a continuous process of planning throughout the entire
                            project. The detailed planning will occurs at the very beginning of the
                            work on each milestone during the innovate-stage.</p>
                        <p>The speculate stage is comprised of several sets of iterations that
                            define the main elements of the project plan. Each iteration involves
                            de-scription of the element by individual team members. They attach
                            their individual propositions to the speculate-context, which enables
                            their comparison with the standards defined in the vision document. An
                            individual proposition is then translated into a collective proposition
                            through the process of standardisation, or it is rejected as a result of
                            this collective evaluation. When an element of the project plan is
                            defined, the speculation moves to another set of iterations, defining
                            another element. The project plan should define at minimum the following
                            elements: </p>
                        <list type="unordered">
                            <item>the project milestones, </item>
                            <item>the milestone owners, </item>
                            <item>required resources, </item>
                            <item>the project risks, and </item>
                            <item>a contingency plan. </item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The first set of iterations identifies the milestones of the projects.
                            The next step is to assign ownership to the milestones. In other sets of
                            iterations, PI and milestone owners estimate the human, technical, and
                            financial recourses required to accomplish a milestone, identify the
                            project risks, and make a contingency plan. The contingency plan should
                            focus on high-level anticipation of possible project pathways since
                            contingency planning in agile approach looks on alternative paths of the
                            project, while in the traditional approach it looks <cit>

                        <p>The innovate-stage involves the work on each milestone of the project.
                            During the speculate-stage, the milestones are prioritised in the
                            project backlog, and each milestone is assigned to a milestone
                            owner — with the resources necessary to accomplish it. However, this is
                            all done on high level speculation, without detailed planning. During
                            the innovate-stage, each milestone is defined in detail. The work on a
                            milestone starts with a milestone planning meeting, which identifies the
                            tasks necessary to accomplish the milestone. The tasks are in-scribed
                            into the milestone backlog, which will be continuously prioritised by
                            the milestone owner. The next step is the actual work on a task,
                            involving intense collaboration and feedback. Each iteration is based on
                                <soCalled>trial and error</soCalled> practices that eventually
                            result in a form of a prototype. Such experimental approach provides the
                            innovation process with possibility to generate early values or fast
                            failures. This prevents the project to be stacked at a dead end.

                            </cit>. The final step in this process is a milestone retrospective
                            meeting, which confirms that a prototype is ready for dissemination.</p>
                        <p>A milestone planning meeting is initiated by a milestone owner, who will
                            give an overview of the milestone, and its relations to the other
                            project milestones and to the project as a whole. The first step is to
                            identify the tasks required to complete the milestone. Each task will be
                            assigned with the task owner, required resources, and time to accomplish
                            the task. However, this is not done by estimating resource allocation
                            and duration along a single sequence of activities. Unlike in
                            traditional project management, an agile approach to planning is based
                            on commitment. Chin points out that planning is tricky in technical and
                            creative environments, such as those of DH projects <ptr target="#chin2004"/>. The actors in such environments need room to
                            experiment with different ideas, so asking them for commitment rather
                            than allocating the tasks with top-down estimate of resources and timing

                        <p>The work on a specific task is the most basic element of the innovate
                            stage. The task is de-scribed by a task owner, who develops a feature of
                            a prototype within the innovate-context. This is then evaluated and
                            tested according to the standards defined in the milestone meeting and
                            presented in the milestone backlog. If the feature does not meet those
                            standards, the next iteration is performed. If it meets the standards,
                            the feature is accepted by the milestone owner, who updates the task as
                            completed in the milestone backlog. In a case when something goes wrong
                            with the execution of this particular task, the milestone owner and the
                            task owner consider whether there is a need for a different path in
                            completing the task, or whether there is a need to modify a standard in
                            the milestone backlog. </p>

                            completely changes the perspective on a proposed prototype, a
                            deliverable, or the project as whole. Such an opportunistic translation
                            should be attached back into the speculate-context or the
                            visionate-context as it has a potential to change the project plan and
                            even the project vision.</p>
                        <p>The final step of the work on a milestone is a milestone retrospective
                            meeting, which is conducted when all tasks from the milestone backlog
                            are completed, and when the milestone owner decides that a prototype is
                            ready for dissemination. The milestone retrospective meeting is used not
                            only to confirm the milestone accomplishments, but also for generating
                            creative ideas for further work on the project. The first part of the
                            meeting is dedicated to confirmation that all tasks have been completed
                            and that a prototype is ready for dissemination. The significance of the
                            completed milestone is discussed in relations to the other project
                            milestones and to the project as a whole. This discussion also addresses
                            possible archiving needs. Brown et al. argue that archiving in DH
                            project is not only a requirement of many funding bodies, but it is also <cit>

                            </cit>, a provisional closure for initial perplexity. The next step is
                            to discuss the lessons learned during the process. Finally, the new
                            ideas, generated during the work on the milestone, are discussed. The
                            particular attention is paid to possible opportunistic translations,
                            identified during the work on this milestone. If necessary, a
                            visionate-iteration and/or a speculate-iteration will be performed, and
                            the project plan and vision will be updated by PI. While traditional
                            project management focuses on conformance to the original plan, an agile

                        <p>The final stage of the project lifecycle is dissemination of the project
                            deliverables. For a prototype to become a deliverable, it needs to be
                            tested, refined, and evaluated. Finally, the procedures for maintaining
                            deliverables should be drafted. A prototype is first tested against
                            technical requirements and refined according to the test. It is then
                            evaluated by each core role in a DH project. This process is thus
                            composed of the minimum three iterations, in which at least a D-role, a
                            H-role, and a DH-role de-scribes the prototype, places it to the
                            disseminate-context in order to be evaluated by the dissemination
                            standards. If it conforms to the standard, it is in-scribed into a
                            deliverable; otherwise, it is moved back to the innovate-stage. It is
                            possible that, even in this stage, a proposition for modification of the
                            project plan or the project vision is generated. While it is not likely
                            to modify the project vision at this stage, such a proposition should be
                            seriously considered. It may be used for defining further studies in the
                            final project report, or as an idea for a new project. However, when a
                            prototype is translated into a deliverable ready for dissemination, the
                            most important decision to be made is to identify the future life of the
                            deliverable. </p>

                            different opportunistic translations, which may provide the most
                            creative ideas for improvement of a deliverable, or even for new
                            projects. The maintenance procedures should consider all features of
                            deliverables in DH projects. They are modular and incremental, they can
                            be used concurrently and laterally in other projects, and they may be
                            opportunistically translated by their users. Therefore, a maintenance
                            plan, which is the final step of dissemination stage, in a DH project
                            should answer not only questions regarding preservation strategies (e.g.
                            Where will the project outcomes be hosted and maintained? How will the
                            deliverables be sustained?), but also questions regarding generative
                            features of DH projects, such as: What are the incremental possibilities
                            of a project deliverable? How can it be used concurrently and laterally
                            in other projects? Can a completed deliverable be used as a departure
                            point for another project? How will use of a deliverable be monitored?
                            What will be a procedure to capture and utilise an opportunistic

                        <p>The final step of the project is to close the project. When all
                            deliverables have been disseminated, PI will prepare the final report of
                            the project. The form of this report will depend of the context in which
                            project has been conducted, but it is most likely to include the
                            following sections: an executive summary, a description of the project
                            trajectory in relation to the project objectives, a presentation of
                            deliverables, a discussion on implications of the project, and a
                            maintenance/sustainability plan. An executive summary will summarise the
                            aim, results, and implication of the project, and identify the main
                            stakeholders. The next section will provide the trajectory of the
                            project in relation to each objective of the project, and it will note
                            any change to the original objectives. A presentation of deliverables
                            will provide description of each deliverable, and discuss their impact,
                            while discussion of implications of the project will present the
                            significance of the project, and its practical and theoretical
                            implications. The project maintenance/sustainability plan will define
                            the project preservation strategy and identify possible generative and
                            incremental features that can be used in other projects, or to be a
                            trigger for a new project. The report will be evaluated on the project
                            closing meeting. If there is any proposition for modifications, the
                            report will be modified during the meeting. In a case of a proposition
                            that requires significant modifications of the final report, a new
                            meeting will be arranged. Otherwise, at the end of the project closing
                            meeting, PI will close the project.</p>

                <head>Conclusions</head>
                <p>Managing complex interplay between digital and humanistic aspects of DH projects
                    requires consideration of insights and methods from different disciplines. This
                    article combined the insights from the humanities and information studies with
                    methods in software development in order to develop a hybrid model for managing
                    DH project. The hybrid model is based on an existing model of scholarly
                    information practices, and adopts its main elements from agile project
                    management methods. According to the model, the main roles involved in the
                    lifecycle of a DH project are D-role, H-role, and DH-role. D-role corresponds to
                    the digital aspects of DH, H-role is related to the humanities aspects of DH,
                    and DH-role combines both digital and humanistic aspects of a DH project. A
                    project member can play more than a single role, and in the smallest projects, a
                    single member will be required to play all three roles. The model employs
                    regular meetings, milestone planning meetings, and milestone retrospective
                    meetings as its main communication ceremonies. The four types of the project
                    outcomes are: vision, plan, prototype, and deliverable. They corresponds to four
                    stages in the proposed lifecycle of a project (visionate, speculate, innovate,
                    and disseminate). The lifecycle of DH projects consists of a constant
                    circulation of information cosmopolitics, in which each iteration transforms an
                    initial perplexity into a provisional closure. However, such a closure is always
                    provisional as through a new inscription new perplexity is invited, which feeds
                    the circulation of information cosmopolitics.</p>
                <p>The proposed model is flexible. The name of work roles, work outcomes,
                    communication ceremonies, or the lifecycle stages are easy to be modified to
                    adopt to different situations. However, it is crucial to keep the features and
                    requirements of the model that address the complexity of DH projects. For
                    instance, it is important to involve the work roles related to both digital and
                    humanistic aspects of a DH project. The communication procedures have to
                    generate feedback and include some retrospective ceremonies. The aim of these
                    procedures is constant learning. The work outcomes in DH projects are modular,
                    incremental, and lateral. The stages in the lifecycle of the project should
                    correspond to these features of the work outcomes. The evaluation is not a
                    separate stage in the lifecycle of a DH project, but it is rather a part of
                    constant circulation of the project iterations. It includes both individual and
                    collective evaluation in order to provide a DH project with both diversity of
                    individual associations and their unification into a collective agreement. The
                    model should thus enable a progressive and incremental lifecycle of creative
                    uncertainties and their provisional closures, presented as a continuous
                    circulation in which the digital and the humanities constantly exchange
                    properties.</p>
