                  <p>Enslavement is linked to enduring and systemic inequalities, hierarchies, and to the
                     erasures of enslaved people's 
                     histories, including their names. Such erasures meant and continue to mean different
                     things to different populations 
                     of formerly enslaved people. Descendants of enslaved people, especially in the diaspora,
                     turned to well-established 
                     means of genealogical research and new forms of DNA research to trace their ancestors.
                     However, in West 
                     Africa and in other parts of the world where obvious racialized markers do not automatically
                     hint at an 
                     enslaved ancestor, many former enslaved people “would rather forget” their enslaved past 
                     or that of their ancestors, precisely because descent from enslaved ancestry remains
                     stigmatized. Ethical 
                     considerations of conducting digital historical research on slavery and emancipation
                     have been hotly discussed for 
                     a number of years, and given the public-facing character of many of these digital
                     projects, the stakes of naming 
                     versus anonymity are high. This article suggests a way forward for those people recorded
                     in the Registers of 
                     Liberation in colonial Senegal.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">Digital humanities projects have great potential to promote social justice and address
                     inequities. Indeed, a key 
                     element of the digital humanities' ability to further social justice is its often
                     public-facing character. Making 
                     information visible to a broad audience, typically via web-based projects, is a major
                     factor in rendering untold or 
                     under-told stories visible and inspiring people beyond academic confines to seek a
                     more just future. This is 
                     particularly true for projects which deal with historical injustices and the experiences
                     of marginalized, silenced, 
                     and subjugated groups, such as enslaved or formerly enslaved individuals. A number
                     of recent projects fit this 
                     paradigm, with initiatives focusing on the experiences of enslaved people throughout
                     the world and during different 
                     historical eras leading the way in terms of availability, richness of data, and research
                     output. The first and most 
                     significant digital project on enslavement is the Slave Voyages Database [<a class="ref" href="#borucki_etal_n.d.">Borucki et al. n.d.</a>]. Other 
                     major projects include Liberated Africans [<a class="ref" href="#chadha_etal_n.d.">Chadha and Lovejoy n.d.</a>],Fugitives from Slavery in 
                     Jamaica [<a class="ref" href="#wood_etal2021">Wood and Smith 2021</a>], the Slave Societies Digital Archive 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#landers_etal_n.d.">Landers et al. n.d.</a>], and Freedom on the Move [<a class="ref" href="#baptist_n.d.">Baptist n.d.</a>]. Additionally, the 
                     Peoples of the Historical Slave Trade website is an ongoing initiative to consolidate
                     the numerous and expanding 
                     projects on this topic [<a class="ref" href="#rehberger_etal_n.d.">Rehberger et al. n.d.</a>].

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">While such digital humanities projects serve an important role in addressing historical
                     injustices and elevating 
                     the voices of the oppressed, their public visibility poses ethical challenges. All
                     researchers bear an ethical 
                     responsibility toward their subjects, whether formalized through institutional frameworks
                     like Institutional 
                     Review Board (IRB) protocols or as an often-unstated backdrop to their research methods
                     and production. The stakes 
                     are arguably higher for projects that are published online and are thus readily available
                     to a global audience 
                     because ethical missteps or inattention to the possible harms to research subjects
                     have the potential to reverberate 
                     across the web and deep into affected communities. Consequently, digital humanities
                     scholars have in recent years 
                     articulated ethical frameworks to guide research and publication, including data presentation
                     and visualization

                     [<a class="ref" href="#hepworth_etal2018">Hepworth and Church 2018</a>]. However, in some cases clear-cut best practices prove elusive. This is 
                     especially true for projects that discuss controversial topics or center historically
                     marginalized communities, 
                     such as enslaved or formerly enslaved people, the subject of the Senegal Liberations

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">Slavery and enslavement always involve physical and social violence. Historical slavery
                     contributed to enduring 
                     and systemic inequalities, hierarchies, and the erasure of enslaved people's histories,
                     including their names. 
                     Such erasures meant and continue to mean different things to different populations
                     of formerly enslaved people and 
                     their descendants. In many contexts, the violence of enslavement and various mechanisms
                     of renaming rendered 
                     formerly enslaved people without history. The particular histories of enslavement
                     hold ramifications for how 
                     descendants of enslaved people view this issue because the end of slavery did not
                     end these forms of inequality and 
                     discrimination. In the Americas, the racialization of status persisted after emancipation,
                     resulting in new forms of 
                     struggle and resistance. Descendants of formerly enslaved people, especially in the
                     diaspora, turned to 
                     well-established means of genealogical research and new forms of DNA research to trace
                     their ancestors. For this 
                     group, recovering their “names” and origins is important, as the trauma of the Middle Passage occluded their 
                     heritage. However, in West Africa and in other parts of the world where obvious racialized markers do 
                     not automatically hint at an enslaved ancestor, many former enslaved “would rather forget” 
                     their enslaved past or that of their ancestors precisely because descent from enslaved
                     ancestry remains 
                     stigmatized.

                     of conducting 
                     digital historical research on slavery and emancipation have been hotly discussed
                     for a number of years 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#odumosu2020">Odumosu 2020</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#dalgeish2011">Dalgeish 2011</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#martina2014">Martina 2014</a>]. Given the public-facing 
                     character of many of these digital projects, the stakes of naming versus anonymity
                     are high. While digital projects 
                     on enslavement can promote public engagement with historical injustices, scholarly
                     research, and pedagogical 
                     innovations, they also risk re-dehumanizing enslaved individuals and their ancestors.
                     Jessica Johnson 
                     challenges us to introduce social justice and ethics into digital enslaved studies
                     in ways that 
                     “mark their humanity” by providing a “window into the everyday 
                     lives of Africans, who remained faceless, anonymous, disembodied” [<a class="ref" href="#johnson2018">Johnson 2018</a>]. Using digital 
                     research to reclaim the humanity of enslaved individuals by tracing their origins
                     and identities has emerged as an 
                     important frontier in this work. However, issues of naming versus anonymity for people
                     descended from enslaved 
                     populations within Africa merit further consideration given the different attitudes toward enslaved 
                     ancestry, raising significant issues regarding the ethics of naming the names of enslaved
                     people. This article 
                     suggests a way forward for those people recorded in the Registers of Liberation in
                     colonial Senegal,

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">We approach our project as a case study showcasing how we addressed a question with
                     major ethical ramifications: 
                     whether or not to include the names of enslaved individuals who obtained liberation
                     on a publicly available website. 
                     Although this may seem like a simple question, reaching a decision about what to do
                     required discussions between 
                     scholars and stakeholders in Senegal, Europe, and North America, as well as 
                     reflections on our responsibility to both the people whose lives are recorded in historical
                     sources and their 
                     descendants. We also drew on ethical guidelines that similar research initiatives
                     have developed 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#rehberger_etal_n.d.">Rehberger et al. n.d.</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#agostinho2019">Agostino 2019</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#johnson2018">Johnson 2018</a>]. After much debate, 
                     reflections, and further research in these sources, we ultimately decided to include
                     names on the SLP website. How 
                     we arrived at this decision requires discussion of the history of enslavement in West Africa and a deep 
                     dive into our sources. Our case study of the ethics of naming versus anonymity will
                     hopefully be of use not only to 
                     other scholars of enslavement and liberation, but also digital humanities researchers
                     working on public-facing 
                     projects utilizing ethically complex sources more broadly.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">These were the political and ethical concerns we had when we began the process of
                     mining the French colonial 
                     Registers of Liberation in Senegal from 1857 to 1903, which recorded the enslaved
                     Africans who sought their 
                     liberation by presenting themselves before French colonial officials. France had decreed the abolition 
                     of slavery throughout its empire on 27 April 1848. Article 7 of that decree stated
                     that “the 
                     principle that the soil of France frees the slave who touches it is applied in colonies
                     and 
                     possessions of the Republic” [<a class="ref" href="#fr1848">French Republic 1848</a>]. In 1848, the enslaved people in the two tiny towns that 
                     constituted the French colony of Senegal (Gorée and Saint-Louis) were freed, 
                     but not all left their owners, who were mostly African and <span class="foreign i">métis</span> inhabitants of 
                     these towns [<a class="ref" href="#gueye1965">Guèye 1965</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#klein1998">Klein 1998</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#getz2004">Getz 2004</a>] 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#westland2022">Westland 2022</a>]. Enslaved people from neighboring African communities and polities began streaming
                     into 
                     these colonial towns seeking their liberation. Due to commercial and political considerations
                     that threatened the 
                     viability of the colony, Governor Faidherbe decreed in 1855 that the 1848 abolition applied only to 
                     French citizens, not subjects of the French empire, and that enslaved people fleeing
                     to French territory from 
                     friendly African polities were to be considered vagabonds and expelled. Fugitive enslaved
                     peoples from African 
                     polities fighting against the French would be welcomed subject to a waiting period
                     and subject to a redemption fee. 
                     Many of those entering the process were enslaved minors, who were subsequently entrusted
                     to named adults for whom 
                     the minors continued to work until they turned 18 [<a class="ref" href="#moitt2024">Moitt 2024</a>]. To keep track of the process, 
                     Faidherbe introduced the Registers of Liberation in 1857 [<a class="ref" href="#faidherbe1857">Faidherbe 1857</a>].

                  <div class="ptext" id="p7">At the outset, the liberations were recorded in handwritten ledgers consisting of
                     nine columns: a number in order of 
                     liberation, the date, the name of the person making the declaration to the colonial
                     official (often the enslaved 
                     person or the enslaver, who was seeking the redemption fee), the name of the enslaved
                     period and the enslaved 
                     person's place of origin, their age, the destination where the liberated individual
                     would live, names of the 
                     individual with whom the liberated individual would live, and signatures of the declarant.
                     In 1875, the ledgers 
                     changed and so did the flow of enslaved people seeking liberation. Political conflicts
                     within and between African 
                     polities contributed to the increase in enslaved people leaving their enslavers. This
                     process accelerated further 
                     after 1883. Pre-printed forms began to be used and the content of the columns changed.
                     Eight columns now included 
                     the number in order of liberation, date of liberation, the profession of the declarant
                     (who was now mostly the 
                     colonial official), the name and place of birth of the liberated individual, their
                     age, the names of the liberated 
                     person's father and mother if known, the name and profession of the guardian to whom
                     the liberated individual was 
                     conferred if that individual was an unaccompanied minor, and the signature of the
                     declarant. By 1883, the French 
                     colonial officials abolished all restrictions on offering liberation and those seeking
                     liberation were offered 
                     freedom certificates the same day they applied [<a class="ref" href="#renault1972">Renault 1972</a>]. Most of the enslaved people seeking 
                     liberation from this period forward were those fleeing their enslavers from elsewhere
                     in Senegal.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p8">Overall, the registers consist of twenty handwritten ledgers from 1857-1903 and record
                     around 28,421 cases of 
                     enslaved people in colonial Senegal seeking to obtain from French officials legal documentation of 
                     their liberation. The registers are held in the National Archives of Senegal. With permission of the 
                     archives, Stanford University acquired a microfilm of the registers, which sat unused until 2018, 
                     when we launched the Senegal Liberations Project. Again, with permission from the
                     National Archives of 
                     Senegal, we digitized the microfilm images in order to enhance them for research. We also
                     returned a copy 
                     of the digital images to the archives in Senegal, which serves as a form of data preservation since the 
                     original registers are deteriorating.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p10">At the beginning of our data entry, we were concerned about the enduring stigma of
                     enslaved descent in 
                     Senegal and whether to include the names of the enslaved people seeking their liberation
                     because having 
                     enslaved ancestors continues to carry social stigma in West Africa and many whose ancestors were 
                     enslaved prefer to keep this past hidden. We consulted with Senegalese colleagues
                     and scholars, who were mostly 
                     urban-based and who were less concerned with this issue than we were. Nonetheless,
                     we proceeded with data entry 
                     without naming the names of the liberated individuals, moving from the most recent
                     records backwards in part because 
                     the ledgers were in better shape and because the handwriting was more legible. Our
                     initial goal was to identify 
                     quantitative trends in the evidence of liberation, which resulted in a preliminary
                     analysis of 10,000 cases of 
                     liberation from 1895-1904 [<a class="ref" href="#goodwin_etal2021">Goodwin et al. 2021</a>]. Our initial results demonstrated significant agency 
                     on the part of the enslaved people who most often strategically fled their owners
                     during the slow period of the 
                     agricultural cycle in order to arrive at their liberation destination in time to begin
                     planting crops for their own 
                     subsistence. A central task of digital humanities is to visualize data in order to
                     make intelligible trends and 
                     patterns to a wider audience. Even though these quantitative trends demonstrated human
                     agency, they still did not 
                     capture the individual lived experiences of the enslaved as they sought their liberation
                     and thus did not fully 
                     capture the challenge laid out by Jessica Johnson and others to better “mark their 
                     humanity” [<a class="ref" href="#johnson2018">Johnson 2018</a>]. This realization brought us to the following reflections on the 
                     politics and ethics of naming names in public-facing digital humanities projects.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p11">There is no easy answer to the simple question: to name or not to name? Answering
                     this in an ethical and responsible 
                     way requires careful consideration of the historical specificity of enslavement and
                     liberation in 
                     Senegal and the wider region of French West Africa. The end of slavery must always be 
                     situated in specific locations. These places were almost always deeply saturated by
                     power asymmetries and social 
                     hierarchies as well as resistance to them. Even in decentralized societies where hierarchies
                     were thinly structured, 
                     power emanating from more centralized polities nearby shaped status and slavery within
                     those societies. The end of 
                     slavery did not mean the end of these power asymmetries or hierarchies; they may have
                     shifted slightly to adapt to 
                     the changed circumstances, but absent radical ruptures, they persisted and imposed
                     significant limits on the meanings 
                     of the end of slavery to the formerly enslaved [<a class="ref" href="#miers_etal1988">Miers and Roberts 1988</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#lovejoy_etal1993">Lovejoy and Hogendorn 1993</a>] 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#klein1998">Klein 1998</a>]. The FulBe of central Mali use the metaphor of the rope to indicate how in 
                     post-slavery societies persistent cultures of hierarchy, the stigma of slave descent,
                     and poverty limited the social 
                     mobility of formerly enslaved people who remained bound to the former enslavers. To
                     be bound to a former enslaver is 
                     also to remain within a network of reciprocity and subsistence security. To remain
                     within the rope requires the 
                     retention of the stigma of enslaved descent and to be known as such. “To cut the rope”, in 
                     contrast, is to separate from the place where the former enslavers' power persists,
                     to risk subsistence security, 
                     and embrace precarity, at least temporarily or until a new set of ropes were established

                     of the nineteenth century were relatively small. The majority of people lived in villages
                     and hamlets; urban-like 
                     agglomerations that served as central places or seats of political or religious authority
                     were few and most had a 
                     seasonal quality during which they swelled a bit during the dry season and shrunk
                     again during the rainy season when 
                     most people turned to farming or led their herds to green pastures. French colonial
                     outposts like Saint 
                     Louis developed urban attributes fueled by an expansion in commerce, which required a built
                     infrastructure 
                     and a labor force of both skilled and unskilled workers, many of whom were enslaved
                     
                     [<a class="ref" href="#klein1998">Klein 1998</a>, 21–25] [<a class="ref" href="#searing1993">Searing 1993</a>, ch. 3]. During the second half of the 
                     nineteenth century, colonial urban spaces expanded in number and scale. Still, most
                     people lived in villages where 
                     social stratification consisted largely of endogamous social categories: free people
                     who could be poor or wealthy; 
                     casted groups of those who controlled skills such as ironwork, praise singing, and
                     leatherwork; and enslaved people 
                     who consisted of the newly enslaved and those born into the house. In the West African
                     savannah, ethnic groups often 
                     identified themselves by economic and cultural boundaries, although there was movement
                     across these ethnic 
                     boundaries. The second half of the nineteenth century also witnessed the rise of several
                     warrior states and militant 
                     Islamic revival movements that fueled the expansion of enslavement and the supply
                     of newly enslaved people 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#klein1998">Klein 1998</a>, 209–217]. The influx of newly enslaved people into villages and emerging urban 
                     spaces certainly contributed to sharpening power asymmetries and cultures of hierarchy,
                     which in turn may have led 
                     to hardening boundaries surrounding social stratification. Militant Islamic revival
                     contributed to social 
                     stratification by dividing communities into believers and non-believers and into those
                     who were legally considered 
                     Muslims and those considered only partially so.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p13">The influx of significant numbers of newly enslaved people into many West African
                     societies during this period 
                     likely sharpened social stratification through endogamy — the rules and practices
                     surrounding who can marry whom. 
                     “Endogamic marriage”, Alice Bellagamba reminds us, 
                     “ensures that moral, social, and material resources will circulate among people who
                     are already 
                     related in one way or another” [<a class="ref" href="#bellagamba2020">Bellagamba 2020</a>, 159–160]. Endogamy also contributed to 
                     enslavers' ideology of “purity of blood” that, according to Ibrahima Thioub, 
                     contributed to the persistence of the stigma of inferiority among enslaved people
                     and their descendants in societies 
                     where enslavers and enslaved people shared the same “chromaticity” 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#thioub2012">Thioub 2012</a>]. While enslavers had powers of sexual access over enslaved women, marriages were
                     
                     restricted between free and enslaved people. Concubinage was widely practiced among
                     Muslims, allowing enslavers to 
                     manumit their female concubines upon the birth of a child if the enslaver chose to
                     recognize his child. Such 
                     endogamy persists to this day in villages and town, which contributes to the enduring
                     stigma of enslaved descent 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#bellagamba2020">Bellagamba 2020</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#pelckmans2011">Pelckmans 2011</a>]. As Paul Irwin notes for the villages 
                     surrounding Liptako, a primarily FulBe historical region that contains modern-day eastern Burkina 
                     Faso, southwest Niger, and southeastern Mali, “a social 
                     calculus based on kinship requires people to know their genealogies” and “genealogies 
                     are so inextricably bound up with notions of personal identity that no one neglects
                     them entirely” 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#irwin1981">Irwin 1981</a>, 43, 20]. The very nature of enslavement involves the rupture of genealogical 
                     continuities, which renders them “truncated” [<a class="ref" href="#rodet2010">Rodet 2010</a>]. A truncated 
                     genealogy is thus a legacy of enslavement.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p14">In many ways, slave descent even long past the end of slavery remains central to social
                     standing and expected 
                     behavior in communities where everyone knows everybody. Slave descent is, as Michael Taussig notes, 
                     a “public secret” which is simultaneously “revealing and 
                     concealing” [<a class="ref" href="#taussig1999">Taussig 1999</a>, 16]. As such, a public secret entails

                     describes his encounter with such a public secret: 
                     <blockquote>
                        <p>Once, when I was a child, I asked my father, 
                           in a room full of people, how we were related to a woman whom I knew and liked, who
                           lived in one of the family 
                           houses. I thought of her, in fact, as one of my “aunts”. My father brushed the question 
                           angrily aside. Only later, when we were alone, did he say that one should never inquire
                           after people's ancestry in 
                           public. She was, as it turned out, the descendant of a family slave. Everybody in

                     For those of us who study slavery and its legacies in Africa, the core questions are, as 
                     Martin Klein poses it: why, given the persistence of inferior social status, do formerly enslaved
                     
                     people remain in the same communities as their formers enslaves and why do they continue
                     to accept even minimal 
                     obligations of deference and subjugation [<a class="ref" href="#klein2006">Klein 2006</a>, 279]? Additionally, what are our obligations 
                     to the public secret of an individual's slave descent? Such questions are relevant
                     throughout West 
                     Africa.

                     specificity rooted in the sources' 
                     provenance in France's nascent West African Empire. Although the French had abolished slavery in its 
                     territories in 1848, French antislavery policy was largely subordinated to political
                     expediency during the conquest 
                     phase. By 1898, the French had pursued conquest aggressively and while small-scale
                     enslavement and the slave trade 
                     persisted, large-scale enslavement had ended with the military victory over the warriors
                     states led by 
                     Amadu Tal, Samori Ture, and BaBemba. During the conquest phase, the French 
                     had not only tolerated slavery but returned runaway enslaved people to enslavers in
                     polities that remained allied to 
                     them. In 1903, the French decreed a new colonial legal system which did not recognize
                     the legal category of the 
                     slave and thus enslavers could not turn to the colonial state to enforce their rights
                     over enslaved people. In 
                     effect, it “delegalized” slavery without abolishing it 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#rossi2024">Rossi 2024</a>, 2, fn. 2]. In 1905, following the expansion of the slave exodus, the French decreed 
                     the prohibition of new enslavement. These two decrees effectively ended the legal
                     status of slavery. But it did not

                     remained with their former 
                     enslavers, Igor Kopytoff argued that those who left were the most marginalized of the enslaved 
                     population, the least integrated into their enslavers' communities and cultures, and
                     most likely the more recently 
                     enslaved. African slavery, in Kopytoff's view, was a system that was predicated on the progressive 
                     integration of enslaved people to the point where the enslaved would no longer be
                     recognizable as such. In the 
                     Kopytoff system, enslaved people were eager for integration and belonging in their enslavers'
                     societies, 
                     even at the expense of some residual discrimination. Kopytoff's view of the end of slavery was one of 
                     a stark dichotomy between belonging and separation, with no space for resistance and

                     exploitative relationship which 
                     offers some promise of subsistence security for an uncertain future.

                     return visits to their natal 
                     villages by young male labor migrants. Claude Meillassoux has argued that lineage and household elders 
                     who remained in their home villages exerted significant control over matrimonial goods
                     and the pool of brides, thus 
                     effectively controlling marriage eligibility. Without access to matrimonial goods,
                     young men could not properly 
                     marry and therefore could not become elders within the ideological context still enforced
                     by the elders. To access 
                     elderhood and, in turn, gain access to established modes of subsistence security through
                     remittances from their own 
                     sons, young men had little choice but to remit their earnings to elders [<a class="ref" href="#meillassoux1981">Meillassoux 1981</a>]. Building 
                     on Meillassoux's materialist argument, Charles Piot explores why long-term migrants in 
                     southern Togo periodically returned to their natal villages in the north, bringing money, consumer
                     goods, 
                     and building materials, even though many of these migrants had settled in the south,
                     built their own networks, and 
                     established families there. Piot discovered that these long-term migrants were drawn back home to 
                     participate in annual rituals precisely because such participation provided them with
                     means to renew their 
                     belongingness to their natal communities and provide their children with a sense of
                     historical continuities 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#piot1999">Piot 1999</a>]. But as James Ferguson reminds us, even those long-term migrants who settled 
                     in cities and mines and found security in stabilized work and pensions could find
                     themselves confronting insecurity 
                     during financial and political crises. By investing in their home villages, these
                     modern workers retained a measure 
                     of subsistence security and cultural belonging [<a class="ref" href="#ferguson1999">Ferguson 1999</a>]. Leaving with the intention of 
                     returning or leaving and periodically returning served to maintain connections, status,
                     and belongingness.

                     at risk, sometimes for an indefinite period. Despite this, enslaved people did leave.
                     Those who remembered their

                     enslaved status and those who wanted to establish households that they could control
                     may also have left. Some left 
                     in groups and others individually. Some left spontaneously while others planned their
                     departures to coincide with 
                     the agricultural calendar, seeking to minimize subsistence insecurity by departing
                     just after the harvest was in and 
                     before the new planting season began, in the expectation of arriving at a new place

                     involved negotiating with chiefs and kin for access to land and entering into new
                     forms of dependency. Enslaved 
                     people who left most likely calculated these costs and benefits and saw that moving
                     was in their interests.

                     deciding the direction of

                     New identities often involved 
                     new names. In such cases, taking on a new name was not a dehumanizing erasure, but

                     James Henry Hammond maintained a ledger in which he kept scrawled records of the births and deaths of
                     
                     the enslaved population on his South Carolina plantation. Because he included the names of newborns' 
                     parents and often some additional commentary, it was possible for me to reconstruct
                     family ties among generations of 
                     people forbidden to keep their own written history. At one point, Hammond purchased an 8-year-old boy 
                     named Sam Jones to work in the house, changing his name to “Wesley” in the process. Nearly three 
                     decades later, “Hammond” recorded the birth of a son to Wesley: a child to whom Wesley 
                     had given the name “Sam Jones”.  As he recorded the baby's birth, Hammond was in all likelihood 
                     unaware of Sam/Wesley's act of memory and resistance [<a class="ref" href="#gilpinfaust2022">Gilpin Faust 2022</a>].

                     Equiano used both names — Olaudah Equiano and Gustavus Vassa — as the author

                        The African</cite>, first published in 1789. The use of both names stimulated a lively debate regarding
                     the author's 
                     birth, his identity, and the authenticity of the narrative [<a class="ref" href="#carretta2005">Carretta 2005</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#lovejoy_p2006">Lovejoy 2006</a>]. 
                     This debate led to a reassessment of the fixedness of names and identities in the
                     Atlantic world during 
                     the early modern period. Drawing from his study of Domingues Alvares, James Sweet argues that 
                     “the Atlantic represented a series of social deaths and rebirths, a repeating circuit
                     
                     of dislocation and dismemberment, marked by an unceasing desire to reconstitute the
                     self through family, friends, and 
                     community. His was a history without end, quite literally a feedback loop of subjection
                     and social 
                     subjectivities” [<a class="ref" href="#sweet2009">Sweet 2009</a>, 304]. Far from being fixed and indelible, identities and names 
                     were “overlapping, shifting, and situational…” [<a class="ref" href="#sweet2009">Sweet 2009</a>, 298].

                  <div class="ptext" id="p28">Enslaved people who remained in Africa but were moved from where they were enslaved to where they were 
                     settled suffered similar social deaths and rebirths as their counterparts in the Atlantic world. 
                     Enslavement in any form was violent; it ruptured connections with kin and community.
                     And it also ruptured genealogy. 
                     In the absence of robust research on naming practices in African societies, most of
                     the evidence we have is drawn from 
                     the colonial period or ethnographic research in the recent past shaped by all the
                     distortions those sources produce. 
                     On top of the physical violence of capture, enslavers subjected newly enslaved people
                     to the symbolic violence of 
                     renaming. Pelckmans notes that renaming the newly enslaved was a central part of asserting domination;
                     
                     it was part of enslavers' efforts to “erase the previous identity of their slaves…. The renaming 
                     of captured people consisted of the imposition of a completely new, often degrading
                     identity…. Slave names were thus 
                     often a source of shame in contrast to the names of the freeborn, which invoked a
                     freeborn status and honorable 
                     condition” [<a class="ref" href="#pelckmans2017">Pelckmans 2017</a>, 257–258]. Gregory Mann suggests that newly 
                     enslaved people did not lose their patronyms (<span class="foreign i">jamuw</span>), which represents 
                     “an all-important identity marker” that is linked to genealogical history and myth. In 
                     contrast, enslaved people born into their enslaver's community (<span class="foreign i">wolosow</span>) were often 
                     given the patronym of their enslavers, which signified “integration” into the 
                     enslaver's household [<a class="ref" href="#mann2002">Mann 2002</a>, 308–312]. Different naming practices for enslaved people certainly 
                     prevailed throughout Africa, but both Pelckmans and Mann recognize the power 
                     of the enslaver to name or rename enslaved people. Both also recognize the power of
                     enslavers to name the children of 
                     enslaved people. According to Pelckmans, enslaved women lacked a “legal 
                     husband” and therefore could not give the patronym of the father to their children 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#pelckmans2011">Pelckmans 2011</a>, 262] [<a class="ref" href="#klein1989">Klein 1989</a>, 213].

                     of naming and 
                     renaming and the introduction of colonial bureaucracies in which registers of names
                     for taxation and military 
                     recruitment assumed greater permanence of names. As Mann argues, changes in family names were 
                     “extremely common under colonial rule, particularly among soldiers” precisely because so 
                     many military recruits were drawn from the former enslaved population that remained
                     near their former enslavers. Former 
                     enslaver and village chiefs were complicit in this process whereby formerly enslaved
                     people assumed the patronym of 
                     their former enslaver and thus substituted for their former enslaver's sons in the
                     recruitment process. Formerly 
                     enslaved people also drew from a wider array of patronyms. Mann refers to this practice
                     as assuming 
                     “names of convenience” [<a class="ref" href="#mann2002">Mann 2002</a>, 39].

                     of governmentality, which 
                     formed a core component of making legible to the state local populations. As James Scott and his 
                     colleagues argue, “In the case of colonial rule, when the conquerors speak an entirely different 
                     language, the unintelligibility of the vernacular landscape is a nearly insurmountable
                     obstacle to effective rule. 
                     Renaming much of the landscape therefore is an essential step of imperial rule…. Like
                     place names, permanent surnames 
                     help to chart the human topography of any region” [<a class="ref" href="#scott_etal2002">Scott et al. 2002</a>, 6–7]. However, the 
                     process of inventing surnames and rendering them legible and indelible by including
                     them in official ledgers was 
                     messy. The process relied on literate clerks, few of whom were trained in the variety
                     of indigenous and local 
                     languages, and on pressures of time to process individuals into these ledgers expeditiously.

                     in the Registers of Liberation. 
                     First, clerks who did not necessarily know or understand local languages transcribed
                     what they heard into names that 
                     they could more easily recognize [<a class="ref" href="#clark2015">Clark 2015</a>]. Clerks may have drawn upon a limited pool of surnames 
                     that may have had some tonal kinship with the name presented by the individual supplicant.
                     Oscar Moráguez 
                     captures well some of these issues in his discussion of the African origins of slaves
                     imported into Cuba: 
                     
                     <blockquote>
                        <p>Planters, lawyers, colonial authorities, and notaries generated lists and descriptions
                           of slaves 
                           — for parish records, property records of individual estates, marriages, baptisms,
                           runaway notices, bills of slave 
                           slaves, and the like — many of which identified African-born slaves by geographic
                           or linguistic criteria or by imputed 
                           nationality. The people who compiled these lists recognized cultural variants, but
                           they did not know much about 
                           Africa itself…</p>
                     </blockquote> [<a class="ref" href="#moroguez2008">Moróguez 2008</a>, 176–177]. Instead, these clerks 
                     “automatically labeled” individuals as belonging to groups just because of where in 
                     Africa they embarked on slave ships [<a class="ref" href="#moroguez2008">Moróguez 2008</a>, 176–177]

                     In his study of the Havana Registers of Liberated Africans, Henry Lovejoy argues that most 
                     African languages were phonetic and what names clerks entered into the registers reflected
                     the tonal structures of 
                     their own native languages [<a class="ref" href="#lovejoy_h2010">Lovejoy 2010</a>].

                  <div class="ptext" id="p32">The second aspect builds on the established practices of enslaved people to rename
                     themselves or be renamed. Taking 
                     the opportunity of redefining oneself at the moment of being recorded in ledgers,
                     enslaved and formerly enslaved 
                     people could present themselves as having whatever surname they wished. As Pelckmans notes, 
                     “Slaves and their descendants have been most concerned to change their surnames”, which 
                     then become “tickets to social mobility” [<a class="ref" href="#pelckmans2017">Pelckmans 2017</a>, 267, 277]. 
                     Thus, the initiative of the enslaved to rename themselves in order to potentially
                     disguise their enslaved origins and 
                     the often-sloppy practices of actually recording names in official ledgers means that
                     we do not really know if the 
                     names being recorded were “authentic” or invented. This process thus resulted in what Scott refers 
                     to paradoxically as “rampant name pluralism” [<a class="ref" href="#scott_etal2002">Scott et al. 2002</a>, 29]. How 
                     do places and practices of naming and renaming, as well as the “authenticity” of recorded names, influence 
                     whether we should include names of enslaved people in our research?

                  <div class="ptext" id="p33">The ethical and political dimensions regarding naming the names of enslaved people
                     are also shaped by the means 
                     through which they achieved their liberation. We can identify four broad paths to
                     freedom: 1) enslavers offered 
                     manumission to individual enslaved people; 2) states mandated abolition through a
                     decree that formally ended 
                     enslavement; 3) naval squadrons and subsequently international courts liberated enslaved
                     people on ships, imposing 
                     treaties that prohibited the slave trade and placed enslaved people within apprenticeships
                     for some length of time; 
                     and 4) enslaved people sought their own freedom through self-purchase, through the
                     courts, or by fleeing to spaces 
                     where they could not be found by their enslavers or where slavery was outlawed. Each
                     of these paths have implications 
                     for the status of formerly enslaved people and on the wider political, cultural, and
                     social environment in which the 
                     paths took place. These different pathways to freedom also have implications for our
                     discussion about the ethical and 
                     political issues regarding whether to name the freed people or not. As we argue, those
                     enslaved people in the Senegal 
                     Liberations project actively sought their own freedom, which involved securing a certificate
                     of liberty in their name 
                     from French colonial officials. Their agency in this regard is essential to how we
                     resolved the ethical and political 
                     concerns for this project.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p34">Manumission was an individual act by enslavers that freed one or several enslaved
                     people. Enslavers manumitted 
                     enslaved people for a variety of reasons, but manumission always reinforced the power
                     of enslavers over enslaved 
                     people precisely because enslavers chose this option. Manumission carried with it
                     a sense of benevolence that also 
                     served the enslaver's interests. The promise of manumission may have encouraged enslaved
                     people to remain with their 
                     enslavers rather than run away or rebel; this promise of manumission may have eased
                     the trauma of sexual violence 
                     against enslaved women in the expectation that they could be freed if they gave birth
                     to their enslaver's child; 
                     manumitting an old enslaved person may have been couched in terms of benevolence,
                     but it also limited the enslaver's 
                     responsibilities to the freed person as that person's capacity to work diminished.
                     Unless they moved away, manumitted 
                     people likely retained some dependency vis-à-vis their former enslavers.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p35">The abolition of slavery was a result of a state decree and most often the result
                     of a long and contested struggle to 
                     end slavery. Although always a state decree, the mechanisms of abolition and the conditions
                     established differed 
                     considerably. British abolition in its crown colonies involved a mandated period of
                     apprenticeship as a transition 
                     from slavery to freedom, although individual enslavers and enslaved people could negotiate
                     shorter periods. In other 
                     regions of the British empire, abolition involved a state decree, but often framed
                     to provide an even longer gradual 
                     end to slavery. Enslaved people were not freed, but those born after a certain date
                     were no longer considered enslaved, 
                     and new enslavement was prohibited. The meanings of freedom, however, were constrained
                     in some parts of the empire by 
                     the coinciding British policy of importing indentured laborers [<a class="ref" href="#northrup1995">Northrup 1995</a>]

                     French West Africa, the French abolished the legal category of slave (“delegalization”) in 1903, thus 
                     preventing enslavers from using colonial courts to control enslaved people, and in
                     1905 prohibited new enslavement. In 
                     Portuguese Africa, a royal decree in 1854 declared Portugal's intention to emancipate 
                     enslaved people in its empire, although gradually. The first stage required enslavers
                     to register enslaved people,

                     the British had established a Royal Navy West Africa Squadron to patrol the coast

                     in Senegal denigrated “colonial freedom” under which all he needed to do was 
                     to request a certificate of liberty from a colonial official. Instead, he insisted
                     on buying his freedom from his 
                     enslaver because this act would “wipe away all his sins, past and present”. 
                     McDougall argues that it was not the price of self-redemption that made the formerly enslaved
                     person free,

                     used names strategically. On 13 
                     December 1897, Fatou Sane, aged 25, presented herself and her three children before the French colonial 
                     officer at Louga, Senegal. Fatou Sane indicated that she was born in 
                     Kajoor to Sallé Niang and Penda Diop. Fatou's surname, 
                     Sane, was neither her father's nor mother's, which suggests that her surname may have
                     been her 
                     enslaver's. Fatou Sane traveled to Louga with her three children: Seinabou 
                     Badiou, aged 6, N'Doube Gaye, aged 8, and Mamdou Badiou, aged 2. All three children 
                     were born in the village of N'Dawa in Kajoor. What is most intriguing about this request for 
                     liberation is that Fatou Sane did not indicate the name or names of the father of her children. 
                     Fatou is recorded as the mother of all three children, and all three children were remanded
                     into her 
                     custody upon their registration as liberated slaves. It could be that Fatou did not know the names of her 
                     children's father or fathers. Or perhaps Fatou consciously avoided naming the names of her children's 
                     father or fathers because she did not want them to reclaim the children. What we can
                     take from this single entry is a 
                     hint that enslaved people seeking their liberation from French colonial officials

                     of deracination and erasure,

                     when in 2020 Fredrick Miller purchased a “handsome” house not far from where 
                     he was born in Gretna, Virginia, he did not realize that he was also buying a historic 
                     plantation among whose former enslaved residents were his own ancestors. Miller and members of his family 
                     used the purchase of the plantation, Sharswood, to conduct genealogical research, only to discover that 
                     the 1860 census did not list enslaved people by name, only by age and gender. Only
                     by digging deeper into the Virginia 
                     Slave Births Index did the Miller family find direct links to an enslaved boy named Samuel 
                     born in 1864. At the time when Samuel was born the plantation was owned by Charles Edwin 
                     Miller and Nathaniel Crenshaw Miller, who gave their surnames to baby Samuel. Only

                     the formerly enslaved people in our historical record. The first is drawn from ethical
                     guidelines embedded in the 
                     rules governing research on human subjects in US federal grants. Universities and
                     research institutes receiving federal 
                     funds must establish Institutional Review Boards charged with assessing research using
                     human subjects. Drawing on the 
                     ethical standards for research on human subjects, we need to be concerned with 1)
                     the obligation to do no harm; 2) 
                     informed consent; and 3) preferences for anonymity. “To do no harm” is directly correlated with “to do good” 
                     or “to provide beneficence”. What does this mean in the case of naming names? Where the stigma of slave descent
                     
                     persists, then naming names may do harm. On the other hand, where the stigma of slave
                     descent persists, opening up 
                     public conversations through public history and teaching modules about enslavement,
                     slavery, and cultural hierarchies 
                     may well undermine such stigma and promote greater equality in society (see Baldé et al. and 
                     Duke Bryant in this special issue). In Senegal and Mali, high school curriculum 
                     deal with the export slave trade but do not engage robustly with slavery and the slave
                     trade in Africa and 
                     thus with the legacies of slavery (see Baldé et al.). The principle of informed consent is predicated upon 
                     providing human subjects with sufficient knowledge and understanding of our projects
                     to make considered and informed 
                     decisions regarding their participation. It is based also on the principle of agentive
                     participation. We cannot, 
                     however, ask this question of our subjects recorded in the Registers of Slave Liberations
                     because they are long dead. 
                     But we could, following Ana Lucia Araujo, ask permission of the descendants of the liberated enslaved 
                     people if we could locate them [<a class="ref" href="#araujo2021">Araujo 2021</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#johnson2018">Johnson 2018</a>, 71]. However, given the 
                     incomplete nature of colonial registers and censuses in the middle- and late-nineteenth
                     century and the paucity of 
                     civil registers of births and deaths in Africa even to this day, such a task may be impossible.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p44">Secondly, since the Registers of Slave Liberations are official French colonial documents
                     that name names, the 
                     regulations closest to these documents may be those governing access to court cases.
                     The Senegalese National Archives 
                     generally follow the regulations governing access to documents held by the French
                     National Archives. The regulations 
                     that come closest to the “legal” character of the registers of liberation are “documents 
                     relating to cases before the courts, subject to the special provisions relating to
                     judgements and the execution of 
                     court decisions”, which remain closed to the public for 75 years following the most recent document
                     in the file 
                     or 25 years following the death of the individual concerned in the case. In the case
                     of a minor, the files remain 
                     closed for 100 years following the most recent document or 25 years after the death
                     of the person concerned. The 
                     Registers of Slave Liberation may also fall under the provision of civil status birth
                     and marriage registers, which are 
                     communicable “from the time they are closed” [<a class="ref" href="#republic2021">Republic of France 2021</a>]. None of these 
                     regulations would prohibit access to the Registers of Slave Liberations or naming
                     the names of the enslaved people 
                     recorded since the last liberation was recorded in 1903.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p45">The third framework for the ethical use of personal information comes from the US
                     Health Insurance Portability and 
                     Accountability Act of 1996, better known as HIPAA. The HIPAA privacy rule was designed
                     to protect individuals' medical 
                     records and individually identifiable health information. While HIPAA is not directly
                     germane to the issue of naming 
                     names, it may be helpful by broadening out the guidance on protection of individually
                     identifiable information, which 
                     would then include basic demographic information contained in the registers. In particular,
                     HIPAA privacy extends 50 
                     years beyond the death of the individual, demonstrating a realization that divulging
                     private information can remain 
                     harmful even after death. HIPAA actually takes into consideration the privacy interests
                     of the surviving relatives 
                     “with the needs for archivists, biographers, historians, and others to access old or
                     ancient 
                     records on deceased individuals for historical purposes”. Thus, even during the 50-year protection period, the 
                     personal representative of the decedent has the authority to lift these restrictions
                     [<a class="ref" href="#usdh2013">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2013</a>]. 
                     HIPAA's consideration of relatives is logical in a medical context, as many diseases
                     have genetic components, and it 
                     is unlike many other privacy frameworks in this regard. Even though the SLP does not
                     incorporate medical information, 
                     HIPAA's framework for long term protection of anonymity offers an important lesson
                     for other kinds of information that 
                     impact relatives and descendants, including the enslaved status of ancestors. This
                     makes it helpful for our project.

                     prohibit the release of personal 
                     information regarding those people who sought their liberation in Senegal from 1857 to 1903. Nonetheless, 
                     the ethical issues of naming names remains and the ethical considerations of publishing

                     Lotte Pelckmans

                           difficult to ask informants discussing name changers to get in touch with those described,
                           since this would be 
                           considered a kind of betrayal…. [W]riting and publishing about this group is an ethical

                     wider discussions about the 
                     legacies of slavery in order to challenge enduring stigma of an enslaved past and
                     an unequal present, we must be 
                     mindful of the politics and ethics of naming the names of enslaved people. But we
                     also must proceed. Enslaved people 
                     who actively sought to change their status through the courts, by self-purchase, or
                     by walking to colonial officials 
                     to secure certificates of liberty should be recognized for the often-heroic efforts
                     they took to secure their 
                     liberation. These enslaved people's actions therefore raise another principle to the
                     ethical consideration of naming 
                     names: those enslaved people who actively sought their liberation wanted their new
                     status to be public. The agency of 
                     enslaved people in seeking pathways to freedom should therefore be considered when
                     determining whether to name names.

                     we get deeper into the project and understand better what the issues are and how to
                     resolve them. This has been the 
                     case with the Senegal Liberations Project. At the beginning of the project, we wanted
                     to respect the widely cited 
                     stigma associated with enslaved descent. But as we developed the project more fully
                     and entered more data, new 
                     questions arose, as did new concerns about the harm we may be doing to the nature
                     of our sources (enslaved people who 
                     actively sought their liberation). As a result, we adjusted our data entry practices
                     to include names. Including names 
                     in our public-facing data and website allows the descendant community the possibility
                     of tracing their ancestors. 
                     Including names also promotes the partial reconstruction of individual lives during
                     a time when other kinds of 
                     historical records are not available for these purposes. Finally, including names
                     provides human faces to the 
                     much-needed political engagement in Senegal and West Africa more widely, emphasizing the 
                     need to confront inequalities and social hierarchies inherited from the era of slavery
                     and persisting into the present

                     enslaved people to find out more about their ancestors. As we go forward with our
                     project and produce a French-version 
                     of our website so that those in French West Africa can engage and utilize the data
                     we are presenting, we will need to 
                     create a system to solicit feedback from descendants as to whether the posting of
                     the names of their enslaved ancestors 
                     is desirable in our public-facing, online project. If not, we could provide anonymity
                     or use a pseudonym on our 
                     website. While our Senegalese academic colleagues do not believe that this is necessary,
                     we want to establish an option 
                     whereby descendants can request that we disguise the names of their enslaved ancestors.
                     Exactly how to do so remains to 
                     be explored (see Hopper in this collection), especially if descendants of enslaved
                     ancestors have differing opinions 
                     regarding naming names publicly. This option may fulfill the promise of doing no harm,
                     but it also changes the 
                     historical record as presented in this public humanities project. The solution to
                     this issue raises even more 
                     political, ethical, and epistemological issues that we must continue to confront.

                     ledgers of the liberated enslaved people in Havana were reliable. He writes, “Prior 
                     to their liberation, the Africans were asked to provide information about themselves
                     that was recorded by colonial 
                     officials in ledger books. Each page of these books was divided into seven columns
                     and each 
                     ‘recaptive’ was given one line on the page. The details recorded by the officials
                     included 
                     a unique identity number, name, sex (man, woman, girl, or boy), age, height, and a
                     description of any distinctive body 
                     markings. In the case of the Sierra Leone and Havana courts, where the large majority
                     of 
                     vessels were tried, an additional column for ‘Country of Origin’ was included, although
                     
                     the Sierra Leone officials eventually discontinued this practice. In addition, the
                     registers clearly 
                     indicate that this information was provided through an African translator who was
                     previously freed by the courts, 
                     and who came from the same region as the slaves on board the vessel under adjudication,
                     thus partially mitigating the 
                     normally severe linguistic barriers that existed between European officials and African
                     captives. To my knowledge, the
