            <p>Enslavement is linked to enduring and systemic inequalities, hierarchies, and to the erasures of enslaved people's 
               histories, including their names. Such erasures meant and continue to mean different things to different populations 
               of formerly enslaved people. Descendants of enslaved people, especially in the diaspora, turned to well-established 
               means of genealogical research and new forms of DNA research to trace their ancestors. However, in <name>West 
               Africa</name> and in other parts of the world where obvious racialized markers do not automatically hint at an 
               enslaved ancestor, many former enslaved people <quote rend="inline">would rather forget</quote> their enslaved past 
               or that of their ancestors, precisely because descent from enslaved ancestry remains stigmatized. Ethical 
               considerations of conducting digital historical research on slavery and emancipation have been hotly discussed for 
               a number of years, and given the public-facing character of many of these digital projects, the stakes of naming 
               versus anonymity are high. This article suggests a way forward for those people recorded in the Registers of

               public-facing digital humanities projects?

          <head>Introduction</head>
            <p>Digital humanities projects have great potential to promote social justice and address inequities. Indeed, a key 
               element of the digital humanities' ability to further social justice is its often public-facing character. Making 
               information visible to a broad audience, typically via web-based projects, is a major factor in rendering untold or 
               under-told stories visible and inspiring people beyond academic confines to seek a more just future. This is 
               particularly true for projects which deal with historical injustices and the experiences of marginalized, silenced, 
               and subjugated groups, such as enslaved or formerly enslaved individuals. A number of recent projects fit this 
               paradigm, with initiatives focusing on the experiences of enslaved people throughout the world and during different 
               historical eras leading the way in terms of availability, richness of data, and research output. The first and most 
               significant digital project on enslavement is the Slave Voyages Database <ptr target="#borucki_etal_n.d."/>. Other 
               major projects include Liberated Africans <ptr target="#chadha_etal_n.d."/>,Fugitives from Slavery in 
               <name>Jamaica</name> <ptr target="#wood_etal2021"/>, the Slave Societies Digital Archive 
               <ptr target="#landers_etal_n.d."/>, and Freedom on the Move <ptr target="#baptist_n.d."/>. Additionally, the 
               Peoples of the Historical Slave Trade website is an ongoing initiative to consolidate the numerous and expanding 
               projects on this topic <ptr target="#rehberger_etal_n.d."/>.
            </p>
            <p>While such digital humanities projects serve an important role in addressing historical injustices and elevating 
               the voices of the oppressed, their public visibility poses ethical challenges. All researchers bear an ethical 
               responsibility toward their subjects, whether formalized through institutional frameworks like Institutional 
               Review Board (IRB) protocols or as an often-unstated backdrop to their research methods and production. The stakes 
               are arguably higher for projects that are published online and are thus readily available to a global audience 
               because ethical missteps or inattention to the possible harms to research subjects have the potential to reverberate 
               across the web and deep into affected communities. Consequently, digital humanities scholars have in recent years 
               articulated ethical frameworks to guide research and publication, including data presentation and visualization 
               <ptr target="#saagsma2023"/> <ptr target="#thykstrup2022"/> <ptr target="#profess2021"/> 
               <ptr target="#hepworth_etal2018"/>. However, in some cases clear-cut best practices prove elusive. This is 
               especially true for projects that discuss controversial topics or center historically marginalized communities, 
               such as enslaved or formerly enslaved people, the subject of the Senegal Liberations Project.
            </p>
            <p>Slavery and enslavement always involve physical and social violence. Historical slavery contributed to enduring 
               and systemic inequalities, hierarchies, and the erasure of enslaved people's histories, including their names. 
               Such erasures meant and continue to mean different things to different populations of formerly enslaved people and 
               their descendants. In many contexts, the violence of enslavement and various mechanisms of renaming rendered 
               formerly enslaved people without history. The particular histories of enslavement hold ramifications for how 
               descendants of enslaved people view this issue because the end of slavery did not end these forms of inequality and 
               discrimination. In the Americas, the racialization of status persisted after emancipation, resulting in new forms of 
               struggle and resistance. Descendants of formerly enslaved people, especially in the diaspora, turned to 
               well-established means of genealogical research and new forms of DNA research to trace their ancestors. For this 
               group, recovering their <q>names</q> and origins is important, as the trauma of the Middle Passage occluded their 
               heritage. However, in <name>West Africa</name> and in other parts of the world where obvious racialized markers do 
               not automatically hint at an enslaved ancestor, many former enslaved <quote rend="inline">would rather forget</quote> 
               their enslaved past or that of their ancestors precisely because descent from enslaved ancestry remains 
               stigmatized.
            </p>
            <p>Such questions of naming and anonymity extend to contemporary research. Ethical considerations of conducting 
               digital historical research on slavery and emancipation have been hotly discussed for a number of years 
               <ptr target="#odumosu2020"/> <ptr target="#dalgeish2011"/> <ptr target="#martina2014"/>. Given the public-facing 
               character of many of these digital projects, the stakes of naming versus anonymity are high. While digital projects 
               on enslavement can promote public engagement with historical injustices, scholarly research, and pedagogical 
               innovations, they also risk re-dehumanizing enslaved individuals and their ancestors. <name>Jessica Johnson</name> 
               challenges us to introduce social justice and ethics into digital enslaved studies in ways that 
               <quote rend="inline">mark their humanity</quote> by providing a <quote rend="inline">window into the everyday 
               lives of Africans, who remained faceless, anonymous, disembodied</quote> <ptr target="#johnson2018"/>. Using digital 
               research to reclaim the humanity of enslaved individuals by tracing their origins and identities has emerged as an 
               important frontier in this work. However, issues of naming versus anonymity for people descended from enslaved 
               populations within <name>Africa</name> merit further consideration given the different attitudes toward enslaved 
               ancestry, raising significant issues regarding the ethics of naming the names of enslaved people. This article 
               suggests a way forward for those people recorded in the Registers of Liberation in colonial <name>Senegal</name>, 
               the topic of the Senegal Liberations Project.
            </p>
            <p>We approach our project as a case study showcasing how we addressed a question with major ethical ramifications: 
               whether or not to include the names of enslaved individuals who obtained liberation on a publicly available website. 
               Although this may seem like a simple question, reaching a decision about what to do required discussions between 
               scholars and stakeholders in <name>Senegal</name>, <name>Europe</name>, and <name>North America</name>, as well as 
               reflections on our responsibility to both the people whose lives are recorded in historical sources and their 
               descendants. We also drew on ethical guidelines that similar research initiatives have developed 
               <ptr target="#rehberger_etal_n.d."/> <ptr target="#agostinho2019"/> <ptr target="#johnson2018"/>. After much debate, 
               reflections, and further research in these sources, we ultimately decided to include names on the SLP website. How 
               we arrived at this decision requires discussion of the history of enslavement in <name>West Africa</name> and a deep 
               dive into our sources. Our case study of the ethics of naming versus anonymity will hopefully be of use not only to 
               other scholars of enslavement and liberation, but also digital humanities researchers working on public-facing 
               projects utilizing ethically complex sources more broadly.

          <head>The Registers of Liberation in Colonial <name>Senegal</name> and the Senegal Liberations Project</head>
            <p>These were the political and ethical concerns we had when we began the process of mining the French colonial 
               Registers of Liberation in Senegal from 1857 to 1903, which recorded the enslaved Africans who sought their 
               liberation by presenting themselves before French colonial officials. <name>France</name> had decreed the abolition 
               of slavery throughout its empire on 27 April 1848. Article 7 of that decree stated that <quote rend="inline">the 
               principle that the soil of <name>France</name> frees the slave who touches it is applied in colonies and 
               possessions of the Republic</quote> <ptr target="#fr1848"/>. In 1848, the enslaved people in the two tiny towns that 
               constituted the French colony of <name>Senegal</name> (<name>Gorée</name> and <name>Saint-Louis</name>) were freed, 
               but not all left their owners, who were mostly African and <foreign xml:lang="fr">métis</foreign> inhabitants of 
               these towns <ptr target="#gueye1965"/> <ptr target="#klein1998"/> <ptr target="#getz2004"/> 
               <ptr target="#westland2022"/>. Enslaved people from neighboring African communities and polities began streaming into 
               these colonial towns seeking their liberation. Due to commercial and political considerations that threatened the 
               viability of the colony, Governor <name>Faidherbe</name> decreed in 1855 that the 1848 abolition applied only to 
               French citizens, not subjects of the French empire, and that enslaved people fleeing to French territory from 
               friendly African polities were to be considered vagabonds and expelled. Fugitive enslaved peoples from African 
               polities fighting against the French would be welcomed subject to a waiting period and subject to a redemption fee. 
               Many of those entering the process were enslaved minors, who were subsequently entrusted to named adults for whom 
               the minors continued to work until they turned 18 <ptr target="#moitt2024"/>. To keep track of the process, 
               <name>Faidherbe</name> introduced the Registers of Liberation in 1857 <ptr target="#faidherbe1857"/>.
            </p>
            <p>At the outset, the liberations were recorded in handwritten ledgers consisting of nine columns: a number in order of 
               liberation, the date, the name of the person making the declaration to the colonial official (often the enslaved 
               person or the enslaver, who was seeking the redemption fee), the name of the enslaved period and the enslaved 
               person's place of origin, their age, the destination where the liberated individual would live, names of the 
               individual with whom the liberated individual would live, and signatures of the declarant. In 1875, the ledgers 
               changed and so did the flow of enslaved people seeking liberation. Political conflicts within and between African 
               polities contributed to the increase in enslaved people leaving their enslavers. This process accelerated further 
               after 1883. Pre-printed forms began to be used and the content of the columns changed. Eight columns now included 
               the number in order of liberation, date of liberation, the profession of the declarant (who was now mostly the 
               colonial official), the name and place of birth of the liberated individual, their age, the names of the liberated 
               person's father and mother if known, the name and profession of the guardian to whom the liberated individual was 
               conferred if that individual was an unaccompanied minor, and the signature of the declarant. By 1883, the French 
               colonial officials abolished all restrictions on offering liberation and those seeking liberation were offered 
               freedom certificates the same day they applied <ptr target="#renault1972"/>. Most of the enslaved people seeking 
               liberation from this period forward were those fleeing their enslavers from elsewhere in <name>Senegal</name>.
            </p>
            <p>Overall, the registers consist of twenty handwritten ledgers from 1857-1903 and record around 28,421 cases of 
               enslaved people in colonial <name>Senegal</name> seeking to obtain from French officials legal documentation of 
               their liberation. The registers are held in the <name>National Archives of Senegal</name>. With permission of the 
               archives, <name>Stanford University</name> acquired a microfilm of the registers, which sat unused until 2018, 
               when we launched the Senegal Liberations Project. Again, with permission from the <name>National Archives of 
               Senegal</name>, we digitized the microfilm images in order to enhance them for research. We also returned a copy 
               of the digital images to the archives in <name>Senegal</name>, which serves as a form of data preservation since the 
               original registers are deteriorating.

            </figure>
            <p>That same year we began entering the liberation data into Excel sheets reflecting the information in the 
               pre-printed columns in which most of the liberations were recorded. Our goal was to build a public-facing website 
               in order to make available this fascinating source to a wider audience in <name>Senegal</name> and throughout the 
               world.
            </p>
            <p>At the beginning of our data entry, we were concerned about the enduring stigma of enslaved descent in 
               <name>Senegal</name> and whether to include the names of the enslaved people seeking their liberation because having 
               enslaved ancestors continues to carry social stigma in <name>West Africa</name> and many whose ancestors were 
               enslaved prefer to keep this past hidden. We consulted with Senegalese colleagues and scholars, who were mostly 
               urban-based and who were less concerned with this issue than we were. Nonetheless, we proceeded with data entry 
               without naming the names of the liberated individuals, moving from the most recent records backwards in part because 
               the ledgers were in better shape and because the handwriting was more legible. Our initial goal was to identify 
               quantitative trends in the evidence of liberation, which resulted in a preliminary analysis of 10,000 cases of 
               liberation from 1895-1904 <ptr target="#goodwin_etal2021"/>. Our initial results demonstrated significant agency 
               on the part of the enslaved people who most often strategically fled their owners during the slow period of the 
               agricultural cycle in order to arrive at their liberation destination in time to begin planting crops for their own 
               subsistence. A central task of digital humanities is to visualize data in order to make intelligible trends and 
               patterns to a wider audience. Even though these quantitative trends demonstrated human agency, they still did not 
               capture the individual lived experiences of the enslaved as they sought their liberation and thus did not fully 
               capture the challenge laid out by <name>Jessica Johnson</name> and others to better <quote rend="inline">mark their 
               humanity</quote> <ptr target="#johnson2018"/>. This realization brought us to the following reflections on the 
               politics and ethics of naming names in public-facing digital humanities projects.

            <p>There is no easy answer to the simple question: to name or not to name? Answering this in an ethical and responsible 
               way requires careful consideration of the historical specificity of enslavement and liberation in 
               <name>Senegal</name> and the wider region of French <name>West Africa</name>. The end of slavery must always be 
               situated in specific locations. These places were almost always deeply saturated by power asymmetries and social 
               hierarchies as well as resistance to them. Even in decentralized societies where hierarchies were thinly structured, 
               power emanating from more centralized polities nearby shaped status and slavery within those societies. The end of 
               slavery did not mean the end of these power asymmetries or hierarchies; they may have shifted slightly to adapt to 
               the changed circumstances, but absent radical ruptures, they persisted and imposed significant limits on the meanings 
               of the end of slavery to the formerly enslaved <ptr target="#miers_etal1988"/> <ptr target="#lovejoy_etal1993"/> 
               <ptr target="#klein1998"/>. The FulBe of central <name>Mali</name> use the metaphor of the rope to indicate how in 
               post-slavery societies persistent cultures of hierarchy, the stigma of slave descent, and poverty limited the social 
               mobility of formerly enslaved people who remained bound to the former enslavers. To be bound to a former enslaver is 
               also to remain within a network of reciprocity and subsistence security. To remain within the rope requires the 
               retention of the stigma of enslaved descent and to be known as such. <quote rend="inline">To cut the rope</quote>, in 
               contrast, is to separate from the place where the former enslavers' power persists, to risk subsistence security, 
               and embrace precarity, at least temporarily or until a new set of ropes were established

            <p>Most population centers in <name>Senegal</name>, <name>Mali</name>, and <name>Mauritania</name> in the middle to end 
               of the nineteenth century were relatively small. The majority of people lived in villages and hamlets; urban-like 
               agglomerations that served as central places or seats of political or religious authority were few and most had a 
               seasonal quality during which they swelled a bit during the dry season and shrunk again during the rainy season when 
               most people turned to farming or led their herds to green pastures. French colonial outposts like <name>Saint 
               Louis</name> developed urban attributes fueled by an expansion in commerce, which required a built infrastructure 
               and a labor force of both skilled and unskilled workers, many of whom were enslaved 
               <ptr target="#klein1998" loc="21–25"/> <ptr target="#searing1993" loc="ch. 3"/>. During the second half of the 
               nineteenth century, colonial urban spaces expanded in number and scale. Still, most people lived in villages where 
               social stratification consisted largely of endogamous social categories: free people who could be poor or wealthy; 
               casted groups of those who controlled skills such as ironwork, praise singing, and leatherwork; and enslaved people 
               who consisted of the newly enslaved and those born into the house. In the West African savannah, ethnic groups often 
               identified themselves by economic and cultural boundaries, although there was movement across these ethnic 
               boundaries. The second half of the nineteenth century also witnessed the rise of several warrior states and militant 
               Islamic revival movements that fueled the expansion of enslavement and the supply of newly enslaved people 
               <ptr target="#klein1998" loc="209–217"/>. The influx of newly enslaved people into villages and emerging urban 
               spaces certainly contributed to sharpening power asymmetries and cultures of hierarchy, which in turn may have led 
               to hardening boundaries surrounding social stratification. Militant Islamic revival contributed to social 
               stratification by dividing communities into believers and non-believers and into those who were legally considered 
               Muslims and those considered only partially so.
            </p>
            <p>The influx of significant numbers of newly enslaved people into many West African societies during this period 
               likely sharpened social stratification through endogamy — the rules and practices surrounding who can marry whom. 
               <quote rend="inline">Endogamic marriage</quote>, <name>Alice Bellagamba</name> reminds us, 
               <quote rend="inline">ensures that moral, social, and material resources will circulate among people who are already 
               related in one way or another</quote> <ptr target="#bellagamba2020" loc="159–160"/>. Endogamy also contributed to 
               enslavers' ideology of <quote rend="inline">purity of blood</quote> that, according to <name>Ibrahima Thioub</name>, 
               contributed to the persistence of the stigma of inferiority among enslaved people and their descendants in societies 
               where enslavers and enslaved people shared the same <quote rend="inline">chromaticity</quote> 
               <ptr target="#thioub2012"/>. While enslavers had powers of sexual access over enslaved women, marriages were 
               restricted between free and enslaved people. Concubinage was widely practiced among Muslims, allowing enslavers to 
               manumit their female concubines upon the birth of a child if the enslaver chose to recognize his child. Such 
               endogamy persists to this day in villages and town, which contributes to the enduring stigma of enslaved descent 
               <ptr target="#bellagamba2020"/> <ptr target="#pelckmans2011"/>. As <name>Paul Irwin</name> notes for the villages 
               surrounding <name>Liptako</name>, a primarily FulBe historical region that contains modern-day eastern <name>Burkina 
               Faso</name>, southwest <name>Niger</name>, and southeastern <name>Mali</name>, <quote rend="inline">a social

               <ptr target="#irwin1981" loc="43, 20"/>. The very nature of enslavement involves the rupture of genealogical

            <p>In many ways, slave descent even long past the end of slavery remains central to social standing and expected 
               behavior in communities where everyone knows everybody. Slave descent is, as <name>Michael Taussig</name> notes, 
               a <quote rend="inline">public secret</quote> which is simultaneously <quote rend="inline">revealing and 
               concealing</quote> <ptr target="#taussig1999" loc="16"/>. As such, a public secret entails 
               <quote rend="inline">knowing and not knowing</quote> predicated around the power and the obligation to keep the 
               secret <ptr target="#taussig1999" loc="2"/> <ptr target="#rossi2009" loc="10"/>. <name>Anthony Appiah</name> 
               describes his encounter with such a public secret: <quote rend="block">Once, when I was a child, I asked my father, 
               in a room full of people, how we were related to a woman whom I knew and liked, who lived in one of the family 
               houses. I thought of her, in fact, as one of my <quote rend="inline">aunts</quote>. My father brushed the question 
               angrily aside. Only later, when we were alone, did he say that one should never inquire after people's ancestry in 
               public. She was, as it turned out, the descendant of a family slave. Everybody in the family knew this, and that 
               meant that she was of lower status than the rest of us. As children, we were required to be courteous to all adults, 
               even those of lower status. But that didn't mean they weren't inferior. <ptr target="#appiah2007" loc="253"/></quote> 
               For those of us who study slavery and its legacies in <name>Africa</name>, the core questions are, as 
               <name>Martin Klein</name> poses it: why, given the persistence of inferior social status, do formerly enslaved 
               people remain in the same communities as their formers enslaves and why do they continue to accept even minimal 
               obligations of deference and subjugation <ptr target="#klein2006" loc="279"/>? Additionally, what are our obligations 
               to the public secret of an individual's slave descent? Such questions are relevant throughout <name>West 
               Africa</name>.
            </p>
            <p>In the Senegal Liberations Project, the enslaved people seeking their freedom have specificity rooted in the sources' 
               provenance in <name>France</name>'s nascent West African Empire. Although the French had abolished slavery in its 
               territories in 1848, French antislavery policy was largely subordinated to political expediency during the conquest 
               phase. By 1898, the French had pursued conquest aggressively and while small-scale enslavement and the slave trade 
               persisted, large-scale enslavement had ended with the military victory over the warriors states led by 
               <name>Amadu Tal</name>, <name>Samori Ture</name>, and <name>BaBemba</name>. During the conquest phase, the French 
               had not only tolerated slavery but returned runaway enslaved people to enslavers in polities that remained allied to 
               them. In 1903, the French decreed a new colonial legal system which did not recognize the legal category of the 
               slave and thus enslavers could not turn to the colonial state to enforce their rights over enslaved people. In 
               effect, it <quote rend="inline">delegalized</quote> slavery without abolishing it 
               <ptr target="#rossi2024" loc="2, fn. 2"/>. In 1905, following the expansion of the slave exodus, the French decreed 
               the prohibition of new enslavement. These two decrees effectively ended the legal status of slavery. But it did not 
               end slavery or its legacies <ptr target="#klein1998"/> <ptr target="#roberts2005" loc="ch. 4"/> 
               <ptr target="#lawrance_etal2012"/>.
            </p>
            <p><name>Klein</name> has argued that around one million enslaved people in French <name>West Africa</name> left their 
               enslavers in an exodus that started around 1896 and accelerated after 1905 <ptr target="#klein1998"/>. 
               <name>Klein</name> also estimates that those who left their enslavers constituted only around one-third of the 
               total number of enslaved people in this region. Not all of the remaining two-thirds (or two million enslaved people) 
               remained with their enslavers; we do know that some not insignificant number separated from their former enslavers 
               and formed new communities, sometimes nearby <ptr target="#roberts1988"/> <ptr target="#rodet2015"/> 
               <ptr target="#rodet2019"/>. But clearly a significant number of enslaved people remained with their former enslavers.
            </p>
            <p>Examining these general statistics regarding the proportion of enslaved people who remained with their former 
               enslavers, <name>Igor Kopytoff</name> argued that those who left were the most marginalized of the enslaved 
               population, the least integrated into their enslavers' communities and cultures, and most likely the more recently 
               enslaved. African slavery, in <name>Kopytoff</name>'s view, was a system that was predicated on the progressive 
               integration of enslaved people to the point where the enslaved would no longer be recognizable as such. In the 
               <name>Kopytoff</name> system, enslaved people were eager for integration and belonging in their enslavers' societies, 
               even at the expense of some residual discrimination. <name>Kopytoff</name>'s view of the end of slavery was one of 
               a stark dichotomy between belonging and separation, with no space for resistance and renegotiation 
               <ptr target="#kopytoff1988"/>. While <name>Kopytoff</name> may have minimized the options available to enslaved 
               people, we have come to appreciate more fully the risks involved in leaving even an exploitative relationship which 
               offers some promise of subsistence security for an uncertain future.
            </p>
            <p>The promise of subsistence security does not quite resolve the problem of how to explain why some who have left 
               returned to their former enslavers' communities, sometimes periodically and sometimes after decades away and after 
               having secured significant alternative subsistence security. <name>Lotte Pelckmans</name> describes the case of 
               <name>Maman Abidjan</name>, a descendant of an enslaved person, who left the village of <name>Dalla</name> and spent 
               nearly four decades in the capital city of the <name>Cote d'Ivoire</name>, where she changed her identity to be part 
               of a casted group, achieved a relative degree of security, and built a social network. Why then did she return to 
               <name>Dalla</name> and why did she accept the subtle but persistent reminders of her subordinate status 
               <ptr target="#pelckmans2011" loc="122, 155"/>?
            </p>
            <p>Anthropologists have long been intrigued by the pattern of remittances and regular return visits to their natal 
               villages by young male labor migrants. <name>Claude Meillassoux</name> has argued that lineage and household elders 
               who remained in their home villages exerted significant control over matrimonial goods and the pool of brides, thus 
               effectively controlling marriage eligibility. Without access to matrimonial goods, young men could not properly 
               marry and therefore could not become elders within the ideological context still enforced by the elders. To access 
               elderhood and, in turn, gain access to established modes of subsistence security through remittances from their own 
               sons, young men had little choice but to remit their earnings to elders <ptr target="#meillassoux1981"/>. Building 
               on <name>Meillassoux</name>'s materialist argument, <name>Charles Piot</name> explores why long-term migrants in 
               southern <name>Togo</name> periodically returned to their natal villages in the north, bringing money, consumer goods, 
               and building materials, even though many of these migrants had settled in the south, built their own networks, and 
               established families there. <name>Piot</name> discovered that these long-term migrants were drawn back home to 
               participate in annual rituals precisely because such participation provided them with means to renew their 
               belongingness to their natal communities and provide their children with a sense of historical continuities 
               <ptr target="#piot1999"/>. But as <name>James Ferguson</name> reminds us, even those long-term migrants who settled 
               in cities and mines and found security in stabilized work and pensions could find themselves confronting insecurity 
               during financial and political crises. By investing in their home villages, these modern workers retained a measure 
               of subsistence security and cultural belonging <ptr target="#ferguson1999"/>. Leaving with the intention of 
               returning or leaving and periodically returning served to maintain connections, status, and belongingness.
            </p>
            <p>Leaving without the intention of returning, on the other hand, involved ruptures. Leaving put subsistence security 
               at risk, sometimes for an indefinite period. Despite this, enslaved people did leave. Those who remembered their 
               natal homes were inclined to leave; those whose lives grated against discrimination and diminished personhood of 
               enslaved status and those who wanted to establish households that they could control may also have left. Some left 
               in groups and others individually. Some left spontaneously while others planned their departures to coincide with 
               the agricultural calendar, seeking to minimize subsistence insecurity by departing just after the harvest was in and 
               before the new planting season began, in the expectation of arriving at a new place in time to resume farming 
               <ptr target="#goodwin_etal2021" loc="figure 1"/>. Making their way home or finding a new place to live almost always 
               involved negotiating with chiefs and kin for access to land and entering into new forms of dependency. Enslaved 
               people who left most likely calculated these costs and benefits and saw that moving was in their interests. 
               <name>Marie Rodet</name> describes the challenges facing a group of enslaved people who left en masse from their 
               enslavers only to find themselves struggling against hostility from neighboring villages and drought before they 
               were able to establish new villages <ptr target="#rodet2019"/>.
            </p>
            <p>We know relatively little about the planning that went into leaving, but certainly knowledge of political and 
               economic conditions circulated among enslaved populations. This may have helped in deciding the direction of 
               departure. Tapping into whatever kind of networks existed may also have helped enslaved people navigate their 
               departures. Knowledge of destinations and knowledge of potential hosts in those destinations contributed to 
               decisions to leave and facilitated integration into the new places. In the expanding peanut zone of 
               <name>Senegambia</name>, hosts welcomed migrants and enslaved people and entered them into forms of dependency 
               involving exchanges of labor or shares of the harvest in exchange for access to land and subsistence security. This 
               was the well-established pattern of the stranger farmer or navetanne system in the peanut zone 
               <ptr target="#klein1998" loc="ch. 12"/> <ptr target="#swindell2006"/> <ptr target="#moitt1989"/>. Formerly enslaved 
               people may have found themselves in new dependency relationships that resembled slavery. Some may also have suffered 
               from status discrimination <ptr target="#bellagamba2009"/> <ptr target="#bellagamba2020"/>. In other regions, 
               formerly enslaved people could take new names and identities and eventually merge with the <q>free</q> peasant 
               communities in which they were living <ptr target="#klein1998" loc="ch. 12–14"/>.
            </p>
            <p>Enslaved people could also join the proliferating number of Islamic communities that welcomed newcomers regardless 
               of their status. Some of these communities promised access to land, subsistence, and learning, while others promised 
               an emancipatory environment in which goods were shared and bridewealth prohibited. This stood in stark contrast to the 
               mosques of their enslavers, where enslaved people and their descendants were unwelcome <ptr target="#hanretta2009"/> 
               <ptr target="#pelckmans2011"/> <ptr target="#obrian1975"/> <ptr target="#babou2007"/> <ptr target="#searing2002"/>.
            </p>
            <p>Hosts played important roles in migration to urban centers and other places where navigating the often-challenging 
               housing and labor markets required significant help. Locating an urban host often meant tapping into existing diasporic 
               networks that linked urban centers with rural villages. As <name>Pelckmans</name> describes, for migrants to 
               <name>Bamako</name>, many of these hosts reproduced the cultural hierarchies from the rural villages preventing 
               migrants from easily escaping established forms of dependency and discrimination <ptr target="#pelckmans2011"/>.
            </p>
            <p>Nonetheless, leaving provided formerly enslaved people with the possibility of getting 
               <quote rend="inline">lost</quote> <ptr target="#pelckmans2011" loc="249"/>. Getting lost meant complete rupture with 
               their former dependencies and the opportunities to establish new identities and new networks. The social costs of such 
               ruptures were considerable, but moving to new areas, founding new villages, or settling into new urban neighborhoods 
               provided the opportunity to invent new identities, even if they may have been fictitious. New identities often involved 
               new names. In such cases, taking on a new name was not a dehumanizing erasure, but part of an individual's claim to 
               fuller social acceptance. The Registers of Liberation provide an important prequel to the better documented slaves' 
               exodus of 1905 by documenting the ebbs and flows of enslaved people actively seeking their liberty in the fifty years 
               prior to the exodus.

               <name>James Henry Hammond</name> maintained a ledger in which he kept scrawled records of the births and deaths of 
               the enslaved population on his <name>South Carolina</name> plantation. Because he included the names of newborns' 
               parents and often some additional commentary, it was possible for me to reconstruct family ties among generations of 
               people forbidden to keep their own written history. At one point, <name>Hammond</name> purchased an 8-year-old boy 
               named <name>Sam Jones</name> to work in the house, changing his name to <q>Wesley</q> in the process. Nearly three 
               decades later, <q>Hammond</q> recorded the birth of a son to <name>Wesley</name>: a child to whom <name>Wesley</name> 
               had given the name <q>Sam Jones</q>.  As he recorded the baby's birth, <name>Hammond</name> was in all likelihood 
               unaware of <name>Sam</name>/<name>Wesley</name>'s act of memory and resistance <ptr target="#gilpinfaust2022"/>.

            <p><name>Equiano</name> recounts how one of his enslavers gave him the name <name>Gustavus Vassa</name>. 
               <name>Equiano</name> used both names — <name>Olaudah Equiano</name> and <name>Gustavus Vassa</name> — as the author 
               of his <title rend="italic">The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano, Or Gustavus Vassa, 
               The African</title>, first published in 1789. The use of both names stimulated a lively debate regarding the author's 
               birth, his identity, and the authenticity of the narrative <ptr target="#carretta2005"/> <ptr target="#lovejoy_p2006"/>. 
               This debate led to a reassessment of the fixedness of names and identities in the <name>Atlantic</name> world during 
               the early modern period. Drawing from his study of <name>Domingues Alvares</name>, <name>James Sweet</name> argues that 
               <quote rend="inline">the <name>Atlantic</name> represented a series of social deaths and rebirths, a repeating circuit 
               of dislocation and dismemberment, marked by an unceasing desire to reconstitute the self through family, friends, and 
               community. His was a history without end, quite literally a feedback loop of subjection and social 
               subjectivities</quote> <ptr target="#sweet2009" loc="304"/>. Far from being fixed and indelible, identities and names

            <p>Enslaved people who remained in <name>Africa</name> but were moved from where they were enslaved to where they were 
               settled suffered similar social deaths and rebirths as their counterparts in the <name>Atlantic</name> world. 
               Enslavement in any form was violent; it ruptured connections with kin and community. And it also ruptured genealogy. 
               In the absence of robust research on naming practices in African societies, most of the evidence we have is drawn from 
               the colonial period or ethnographic research in the recent past shaped by all the distortions those sources produce. 
               On top of the physical violence of capture, enslavers subjected newly enslaved people to the symbolic violence of 
               renaming. <name>Pelckmans</name> notes that renaming the newly enslaved was a central part of asserting domination; 
               it was part of enslavers' efforts to <quote rend="inline">erase the previous identity of their slaves…. The renaming 
               of captured people consisted of the imposition of a completely new, often degrading identity…. Slave names were thus 
               often a source of shame in contrast to the names of the freeborn, which invoked a freeborn status and honorable 
               condition</quote> <ptr target="#pelckmans2017" loc="257–258"/>. <name>Gregory Mann</name> suggests that newly 
               enslaved people did not lose their patronyms (<foreign xml:lang="">jamuw</foreign>), which represents 
               <quote rend="inline">an all-important identity marker</quote> that is linked to genealogical history and myth. In 
               contrast, enslaved people born into their enslaver's community (<foreign xml:lang="">wolosow</foreign>) were often 
               given the patronym of their enslavers, which signified <quote rend="inline">integration</quote> into the 
               enslaver's household <ptr target="#mann2002" loc="308–312"/>. Different naming practices for enslaved people certainly 
               prevailed throughout <name>Africa</name>, but both <name>Pelckmans</name> and <name>Mann</name> recognize the power 
               of the enslaver to name or rename enslaved people. Both also recognize the power of enslavers to name the children of 
               enslaved people. According to <name>Pelckmans</name>, enslaved women lacked a <quote rend="inline">legal 
               husband</quote> and therefore could not give the patronym of the father to their children 
               <ptr target="#pelckmans2011" loc="262"/> <ptr target="#klein1989" loc="213"/>.
            </p>
            <p><name>Mann</name>'s larger argument, however, focused on the discrepancies between local practices of naming and 
               renaming and the introduction of colonial bureaucracies in which registers of names for taxation and military 
               recruitment assumed greater permanence of names. As <name>Mann</name> argues, changes in family names were 
               <quote rend="inline">extremely common under colonial rule, particularly among soldiers</quote> precisely because so 
               many military recruits were drawn from the former enslaved population that remained near their former enslavers. Former 
               enslaver and village chiefs were complicit in this process whereby formerly enslaved people assumed the patronym of 
               their former enslaver and thus substituted for their former enslaver's sons in the recruitment process. Formerly 
               enslaved people also drew from a wider array of patronyms. Mann refers to this practice as assuming 
               <quote rend="inline">names of convenience</quote> <ptr target="#mann2002" loc="39"/>.
            </p>
            <p>Maintaining registers of names for taxation and recruitment was central to the instruments of governmentality, which 
               formed a core component of making legible to the state local populations. As <name>James Scott</name> and his 
               colleagues argue, <quote rend="inline">In the case of colonial rule, when the conquerors speak an entirely different 
               language, the unintelligibility of the vernacular landscape is a nearly insurmountable obstacle to effective rule. 
               Renaming much of the landscape therefore is an essential step of imperial rule…. Like place names, permanent surnames 
               help to chart the human topography of any region</quote> <ptr target="#scott_etal2002" loc="6–7"/>. However, the 
               process of inventing surnames and rendering them legible and indelible by including them in official ledgers was 
               messy. The process relied on literate clerks, few of whom were trained in the variety of indigenous and local 
               languages, and on pressures of time to process individuals into these ledgers expeditiously.
            </p>
            <p>Two aspects of this messy process merged when recording evidence of enslaved people in the Registers of Liberation. 
               First, clerks who did not necessarily know or understand local languages transcribed what they heard into names that 
               they could more easily recognize <ptr target="#clark2015"/>. Clerks may have drawn upon a limited pool of surnames 
               that may have had some tonal kinship with the name presented by the individual supplicant. <name>Oscar Moráguez</name> 
               captures well some of these issues in his discussion of the African origins of slaves imported into <name>Cuba</name>: 
               <quote rend="block">Planters, lawyers, colonial authorities, and notaries generated lists and descriptions of slaves 
               — for parish records, property records of individual estates, marriages, baptisms, runaway notices, bills of slave 
               slaves, and the like — many of which identified African-born slaves by geographic or linguistic criteria or by imputed 
               nationality. The people who compiled these lists recognized cultural variants, but they did not know much about 
               <name>Africa</name> itself…</quote> <ptr target="#moroguez2008" loc="176–177"/>. Instead, these clerks 
               <quote rend="inline">automatically labeled</quote> individuals as belonging to groups just because of where in 
               <name>Africa</name> they embarked on slave ships <ptr target="#moroguez2008" loc="176–177"/> 
               <ptr target="#misevich2008" loc="156"/>.<note><name>Philip Misevich</name> argues that the names recorded in the 
               ledgers of the liberated enslaved people in <name>Havana</name> were reliable. He writes, <quote rend="inline">Prior 
               to their liberation, the Africans were asked to provide information about themselves that was recorded by colonial 
               officials in ledger books. Each page of these books was divided into seven columns and each 
               <quote rend="inline">recaptive</quote> was given one line on the page. The details recorded by the officials included 
               a unique identity number, name, sex (man, woman, girl, or boy), age, height, and a description of any distinctive body 
               markings. In the case of the <name>Sierra Leone</name> and <name>Havana</name> courts, where the large majority of 
               vessels were tried, an additional column for <quote rend="inline">Country of Origin</quote> was included, although 
               the <name>Sierra Leone</name> officials eventually discontinued this practice. In addition, the registers clearly 
               indicate that this information was provided through an African translator who was previously freed by the courts, 
               and who came from the same region as the slaves on board the vessel under adjudication, thus partially mitigating the 
               normally severe linguistic barriers that existed between European officials and African captives. To my knowledge, the 
               registers represent the earliest extant list of indigenous African names</quote> <ptr target="#misevich2008"/>.</note> 
               In his study of the <name>Havana</name> Registers of Liberated Africans, <name>Henry Lovejoy</name> argues that most 
               African languages were phonetic and what names clerks entered into the registers reflected the tonal structures of 
               their own native languages <ptr target="#lovejoy_h2010"/>.
            </p>
            <p>The second aspect builds on the established practices of enslaved people to rename themselves or be renamed. Taking 
               the opportunity of redefining oneself at the moment of being recorded in ledgers, enslaved and formerly enslaved 
               people could present themselves as having whatever surname they wished. As <name>Pelckmans</name> notes, 
               <quote rend="inline">Slaves and their descendants have been most concerned to change their surnames</quote>, which 
               then become <quote rend="inline">tickets to social mobility</quote> <ptr target="#pelckmans2017" loc="267, 277"/>. 
               Thus, the initiative of the enslaved to rename themselves in order to potentially disguise their enslaved origins and 
               the often-sloppy practices of actually recording names in official ledgers means that we do not really know if the 
               names being recorded were <q>authentic</q> or invented. This process thus resulted in what <name>Scott</name> refers 
               to paradoxically as <quote rend="inline">rampant name pluralism</quote> <ptr target="#scott_etal2002" loc="29"/>. How 
               do places and practices of naming and renaming, as well as the <q>authenticity</q> of recorded names, influence 
               whether we should include names of enslaved people in our research?

          <head>Naming Names and the Paths to Freedom</head>
            <p>The ethical and political dimensions regarding naming the names of enslaved people are also shaped by the means 
               through which they achieved their liberation. We can identify four broad paths to freedom: 1) enslavers offered 
               manumission to individual enslaved people; 2) states mandated abolition through a decree that formally ended 
               enslavement; 3) naval squadrons and subsequently international courts liberated enslaved people on ships, imposing 
               treaties that prohibited the slave trade and placed enslaved people within apprenticeships for some length of time; 
               and 4) enslaved people sought their own freedom through self-purchase, through the courts, or by fleeing to spaces 
               where they could not be found by their enslavers or where slavery was outlawed. Each of these paths have implications 
               for the status of formerly enslaved people and on the wider political, cultural, and social environment in which the 
               paths took place. These different pathways to freedom also have implications for our discussion about the ethical and 
               political issues regarding whether to name the freed people or not. As we argue, those enslaved people in the Senegal 
               Liberations project actively sought their own freedom, which involved securing a certificate of liberty in their name 
               from French colonial officials. Their agency in this regard is essential to how we resolved the ethical and political 
               concerns for this project.
            </p>
            <p>Manumission was an individual act by enslavers that freed one or several enslaved people. Enslavers manumitted 
               enslaved people for a variety of reasons, but manumission always reinforced the power of enslavers over enslaved 
               people precisely because enslavers chose this option. Manumission carried with it a sense of benevolence that also 
               served the enslaver's interests. The promise of manumission may have encouraged enslaved people to remain with their 
               enslavers rather than run away or rebel; this promise of manumission may have eased the trauma of sexual violence 
               against enslaved women in the expectation that they could be freed if they gave birth to their enslaver's child; 
               manumitting an old enslaved person may have been couched in terms of benevolence, but it also limited the enslaver's 
               responsibilities to the freed person as that person's capacity to work diminished. Unless they moved away, manumitted 
               people likely retained some dependency vis-à-vis their former enslavers.
            </p>
            <p>The abolition of slavery was a result of a state decree and most often the result of a long and contested struggle to 
               end slavery. Although always a state decree, the mechanisms of abolition and the conditions established differed 
               considerably. British abolition in its crown colonies involved a mandated period of apprenticeship as a transition 
               from slavery to freedom, although individual enslavers and enslaved people could negotiate shorter periods. In other 
               regions of the British empire, abolition involved a state decree, but often framed to provide an even longer gradual 
               end to slavery. Enslaved people were not freed, but those born after a certain date were no longer considered enslaved, 
               and new enslavement was prohibited. The meanings of freedom, however, were constrained in some parts of the empire by 
               the coinciding British policy of importing indentured laborers <ptr target="#northrup1995"/> 
               <ptr target="#connolly2024"/>. Except for minors, French abolition of 1848 did not mandate a period of apprenticeship 
               but applied abolition only to physical spaces considered French soil, leaving considerable latitude to colonial 
               governors to define these borders <ptr target="#klein1998"/> <ptr target="#getz2004"/> <ptr target="#dukebryant2019"/> 
               <ptr target="#moitt2024"/>. In those colonial regions considered protectorates, French abolition was indirect: in 
               French <name>West Africa</name>, the French abolished the legal category of slave (<q>delegalization</q>) in 1903, thus 
               preventing enslavers from using colonial courts to control enslaved people, and in 1905 prohibited new enslavement. In 
               Portuguese <name>Africa</name>, a royal decree in 1854 declared <name>Portugal</name>'s intention to emancipate 
               enslaved people in its empire, although gradually. The first stage required enslavers to register enslaved people, 
               and failure to do so rendered them into <term xml:lang="pt">libertos</term> (free person), who still had to work for 
               their enslavers. Additional decrees over the next twenty years changed the legal status of enslaved people and 
               <foreign xml:lang="pt">libertos</foreign>, but as <name>Daniel Domingues</name> and <name>Edward Alpers</name> argue, 
               <quote rend="inline">that for most individuals … there was apparently little difference between what they had 
               experienced as slaves</quote> <ptr target="#dasilva_etal2021"/> <ptr target="#cooper_etal2000"/>.
            </p>
            <p>As part of the broader global (but largely British) effort to end the slave trade, European nations after the 
               Napoleonic Wars entered treaties allowing the search and seizure of ships carrying enslaved people. Already in 1808, 
               the British had established a Royal Navy West Africa Squadron to patrol the coast in order to put teeth into the 1807 
               Parliamentary Act to Abolish the Slave Trade. Seized slave ships were directed to the courts of the Vice Admiralty and 
               later to Mixed Commission Courts, which adjudicated the case. If the evidence proved prohibited activities, the ship 
               was seized and sold, and the enslaved people liberated. Many of the liberated Africans found themselves in 
               apprenticeship conditions for varying periods of time <ptr target="#martinez2012"/> <ptr target="#bethell1966"/> 
               <ptr target="#pearson2016"/> <ptr target="#chadha_etal_n.d."/> <ptr target="#anderson2020"/>. By far the largest and 
               best analyzed of these registers was kept at <name>Freetown</name>, <name>Sierra Leone</name>. The 
               <name>Freetown</name> register of liberated Africans contains selected details from 81,745 Africans landed in 
               <name>Freetown</name> from 1808 to 1863 <ptr target="#anderson2020"/> <ptr target="#misevich2019"/>. It is important 
               to remember that through their actions on the seas and in courts, Europeans liberated the enslaved Africans referred 
               to as <q>Liberated Africans</q>.
            </p>
            <p>Through the fourth path, enslaved people sought their own freedom through self-purchase, through the courts, or by 
               fleeing to spaces where slavery was outlawed. Free or freed people who were falsely enslaved had recourse to courts if 
               they knew how to access these courts and had the evidence necessary to prove their status 
               <ptr target="#candido2016"/>. Some societies provided enslaved people with the option to liberate themselves through 
               self-purchase, usually for a sum equivalent to the cost of a young, productive enslaved person. In 1880s 
               <name>Cuba</name>, a gradual end of slavery was decreed and enslaved people found themselves in the slave-like 
               condition of <term xml:lang="es">patrocinada</term>, which like British apprenticeship gradually ended and placed the 
               relationship under the scrutiny of a new institution controlled largely by enslavers and wealthy businessmen. Even 
               though the 1880 law set the date for the formal end of enslavement, <name>Rebecca Scott</name> writes that 
               <quote rend="inline">the unusual effort made by <term xml:lang="es">patrocinados</term> to achieve their freedom 
               through indemnification of services suggests that the act of self-purchase has a particular importance for the man or 
               woman who could achieve it</quote> <ptr target="#scott2000" loc="153–154"/>. The slow death for slavery in 
               <name>Northern Nigeria</name> rested in part on enlarging the pathway for self-redemption by outlawing new enslavement 
               and by declaring all children born to enslaved mothers freed as of 1 March 1901 <ptr target="#lovejoy_etal1993"/>. 
               Even in post-slavery societies, where slavery is no longer a legally recognized institution, some formerly enslaved 
               people chose to redeem themselves because this act imparted a new level of respectability. <name>Elisabeth 
               McMahon</name> reminds us that in in Islamic societies, former enslaved people <quote rend="inline">had the possibility 
               for social mobility, but their ability to attain respectability likewise left them vulnerable…</quote> 
               <ptr target="#mcmahon2013"/>. Formerly enslaved people on <name>Pemba</name>, an island off the East African coast, 
               invested in <foreign xml:lang="">heshima</foreign>, which was an expansive term that referred to respectability and 
               honor, but within the established idiom of the standards of pious behavior and deportment established by the Arab 
               elite <ptr target="#mcmahon2013" loc="6–7"/>. <name>Ann McDougall</name> recounts how an elderly former enslaved person 
               in <name>Senegal</name> denigrated <quote rend="inline">colonial freedom</quote> under which all he needed to do was 
               to request a certificate of liberty from a colonial official. Instead, he insisted on buying his freedom from his 
               enslaver because this act would <quote rend="inline">wipe away all his sins, past and present</quote>. 
               <name>McDougall</name> argues that it was not the price of self-redemption that made the formerly enslaved person free, 
               but the act of pilgrimage. And only legally free people could make the <term xml:lang="ar">hajj</term> 
               <ptr target="#mcdougall2007" loc="174–175"/>. Self-purchase was thus a step towards becoming free and respectable. In 
               her ethnographic research in central <name>Mali</name>, <name>Lotte Pelckmans</name> also found that formerly 
               enslaved people continued to negotiate their self-purchase from their former enslavers even though they were legally 
               free because they wanted both the respectability from this act and because this act allowed them to make the pilgrimage 
               <ptr target="#pelckmans2011" loc="ch. 5"/>.
            </p>
            <p>Enslaved people who wanted to leave their enslavers had many different options; the most common was simply to leave. 
               Risks abounded for those who sought to leave their enslavers. The enslavers could try to hunt them down and force their 
               return; enslavers could confiscate children and goods that the enslaved people possessed; and those who left faced real 
               dangers of hunger. We have bits and pieces of records of those who left, particularly after 1899 and especially after 
               1905 <ptr target="#klein1998"/> <ptr target="#roberts2005"/> <ptr target="#rodet2010"/>.

            <p>The enslaved people in the Senegal Liberation Registers actively sought what French colonial officials offered them: 
               certificates of liberty. The enslaved people in the wider Senegal-Mali-Mauritanian region who walked to French colonial 
               officials thus shared with those who engaged with self-purchase an intention to end their enslavement. Whether through 
               self-purchase or by walking towards French colonial officials, these individuals engaged in purposeful actions with 
               specific goals to have their new status recognized within their communities, by their former enslavers, and/or by 
               governmental officials. These enslaved people wanted their names and their new status inscribed in certificates of 
               liberty and in the Registers of Slave Liberation. They wanted or at least they accepted that to signify their new 
               status, they needed to do so publicly. Their decision to seek their liberation meant that they needed and wanted public 
               recognition of their new status.
            </p>
            <p>Enslaved people seeking their liberation from French colonial officials sometimes used names strategically. On 13 
               December 1897, <name>Fatou Sane</name>, aged 25, presented herself and her three children before the French colonial 
               officer at <name>Louga</name>, <name>Senegal</name>. <name>Fatou Sane</name> indicated that she was born in 
               <name>Kajoor</name> to <name>Sallé Niang</name> and <name>Penda Diop</name>. <name>Fatou</name>'s surname, 
               <name>Sane</name>, was neither her father's nor mother's, which suggests that her surname may have been her 
               enslaver's. <name>Fatou Sane</name> traveled to <name>Louga</name> with her three children: <name>Seinabou 
               Badiou</name>, aged 6, <name>N'Doube Gaye</name>, aged 8, and <name>Mamdou Badiou</name>, aged 2. All three children 
               were born in the village of <name>N'Dawa</name> in <name>Kajoor</name>. What is most intriguing about this request for 
               liberation is that <name>Fatou Sane</name> did not indicate the name or names of the father of her children. 
               <name>Fatou</name> is recorded as the mother of all three children, and all three children were remanded into her 
               custody upon their registration as liberated slaves. It could be that <name>Fatou</name> did not know the names of her 
               children's father or fathers. Or perhaps <name>Fatou</name> consciously avoided naming the names of her children's 
               father or fathers because she did not want them to reclaim the children. What we can take from this single entry is a 
               hint that enslaved people seeking their liberation from French colonial officials through the Senegal Liberation 
               Registers used names — their own and their children's — consciously and with intentionality.

          <head>Ethical Guidelines and Politics of Naming the Names of Enslaved People</head>
            <p>Robust and clearly articulated ethical guidelines are critical for scholars engaged in research involving enslaved 
               people or their descendants, particularly when that research takes place under conditions of inequality. This is 
               because thoughtless research practices can easily reproduce the erasures and violence of enslavement, including 
               experiences such as rupture from natal homes and families as well as the social violence of being renamed, often 
               several times. Enslaved people across the world have struggled against these processes of deracination and erasure, 
               in part by building anew kinship and communities <ptr target="#mintz_etal1992"/> <ptr target="#hawthorne2010"/>. 
               However, such experiences meant different things to different populations of formerly enslaved people. For example, 
               when in 2020 <name>Fredrick Miller</name> purchased a <quote rend="inline">handsome</quote> house not far from where 
               he was born in <name>Gretna</name>, <name>Virginia</name>, he did not realize that he was also buying a historic 
               plantation among whose former enslaved residents were his own ancestors. <name>Miller</name> and members of his family 
               used the purchase of the plantation, <name>Sharswood</name>, to conduct genealogical research, only to discover that 
               the 1860 census did not list enslaved people by name, only by age and gender. Only by digging deeper into the Virginia 
               Slave Births Index did the <name>Miller</name> family find direct links to an enslaved boy named <name>Samuel</name> 
               born in 1864. At the time when <name>Samuel</name> was born the plantation was owned by <name>Charles Edwin 
               Miller</name> and <name>Nathaniel Crenshaw Miller</name>, who gave their surnames to baby <name>Samuel</name>. Only 
               now, the <name>Miller</name> family <quote rend="inline">is reclaiming its past</quote> <ptr target="#heim2022a"/>. 
            </p> 
            <p>Through various mechanisms of renaming, formerly enslaved people were <quote rend="inline">rendered without 
               history</quote>. Descendants of formerly enslaved people, especially in the diaspora, turned to well-established 
               means of genealogical research to trace their ancestors, while others have gravitated to newer methods of DNA research 
               to find out their ancestral origins <ptr target="#sweet2022"/>. For this group, recovering their <q>names</q> and 
               their origins are important and humanizing. For other descendants of enslaved ancestors in other parts of the world, 
               recovering the names of their enslaved ancestors may not be welcomed, especially when they chose to live close to their 
               former enslavers <ptr target="#klein1998"/> <ptr target="#elhamel2013"/> <ptr target="#becker2021"/>. Although a 
               <q>public secret</q> of an enslaved past may be widely known, as <name>Alice Bellagamba</name>'s elderly Gambian 
               informants argue, <quote rend="inline">not all should be said</quote> <ptr target="#bellagamba2012" loc="39–40"/>. 
               So how do historians working with evidence of the enslaved past navigate these ethical and political cross currents?
            </p>
            <p>We have identified three different but overlapping ethical and legal frameworks to help us think about whether to name 
               the formerly enslaved people in our historical record. The first is drawn from ethical guidelines embedded in the 
               rules governing research on human subjects in US federal grants. Universities and research institutes receiving federal 
               funds must establish Institutional Review Boards charged with assessing research using human subjects. Drawing on the 
               ethical standards for research on human subjects, we need to be concerned with 1) the obligation to do no harm; 2) 
               informed consent; and 3) preferences for anonymity. <q>To do no harm</q> is directly correlated with <q>to do good</q> 
               or <q>to provide beneficence</q>. What does this mean in the case of naming names? Where the stigma of slave descent 
               persists, then naming names may do harm. On the other hand, where the stigma of slave descent persists, opening up 
               public conversations through public history and teaching modules about enslavement, slavery, and cultural hierarchies 
               may well undermine such stigma and promote greater equality in society (see <name>Baldé</name> et al. and 
               <name>Duke Bryant</name> in this special issue). In <name>Senegal</name> and <name>Mali</name>, high school curriculum 
               deal with the export slave trade but do not engage robustly with slavery and the slave trade in <name>Africa</name> and 
               thus with the legacies of slavery (see <name>Baldé</name> et al.). The principle of informed consent is predicated upon 
               providing human subjects with sufficient knowledge and understanding of our projects to make considered and informed 
               decisions regarding their participation. It is based also on the principle of agentive participation. We cannot, 
               however, ask this question of our subjects recorded in the Registers of Slave Liberations because they are long dead. 
               But we could, following <name>Ana Lucia Araujo</name>, ask permission of the descendants of the liberated enslaved 
               people if we could locate them <ptr target="#araujo2021"/> <ptr target="#johnson2018" loc="71"/>. However, given the 
               incomplete nature of colonial registers and censuses in the middle- and late-nineteenth century and the paucity of 
               civil registers of births and deaths in <name>Africa</name> even to this day, such a task may be impossible.
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, since the Registers of Slave Liberations are official French colonial documents that name names, the 
               regulations closest to these documents may be those governing access to court cases. The Senegalese National Archives 
               generally follow the regulations governing access to documents held by the French National Archives. The regulations 
               that come closest to the <q>legal</q> character of the registers of liberation are <quote rend="inline">documents 
               relating to cases before the courts, subject to the special provisions relating to judgements and the execution of 
               court decisions</quote>, which remain closed to the public for 75 years following the most recent document in the file 
               or 25 years following the death of the individual concerned in the case. In the case of a minor, the files remain 
               closed for 100 years following the most recent document or 25 years after the death of the person concerned. The 
               Registers of Slave Liberation may also fall under the provision of civil status birth and marriage registers, which are 
               communicable <quote rend="inline">from the time they are closed</quote> <ptr target="#republic2021"/>. None of these 
               regulations would prohibit access to the Registers of Slave Liberations or naming the names of the enslaved people 
               recorded since the last liberation was recorded in 1903.
            </p>
            <p>The third framework for the ethical use of personal information comes from the US Health Insurance Portability and 
               Accountability Act of 1996, better known as HIPAA. The HIPAA privacy rule was designed to protect individuals' medical 
               records and individually identifiable health information. While HIPAA is not directly germane to the issue of naming 
               names, it may be helpful by broadening out the guidance on protection of individually identifiable information, which 
               would then include basic demographic information contained in the registers. In particular, HIPAA privacy extends 50 
               years beyond the death of the individual, demonstrating a realization that divulging private information can remain 
               harmful even after death. HIPAA actually takes into consideration the privacy interests of the surviving relatives 
               <quote rend="inline">with the needs for archivists, biographers, historians, and others to access old or ancient 
               records on deceased individuals for historical purposes</quote>. Thus, even during the 50-year protection period, the 
               personal representative of the decedent has the authority to lift these restrictions <ptr target="#usdh2013"/>. 
               HIPAA's consideration of relatives is logical in a medical context, as many diseases have genetic components, and it 
               is unlike many other privacy frameworks in this regard. Even though the SLP does not incorporate medical information, 
               HIPAA's framework for long term protection of anonymity offers an important lesson for other kinds of information that 
               impact relatives and descendants, including the enslaved status of ancestors. This makes it helpful for our project.
            </p>
            <p>From a purely legal or regulatory perspective, these three ethical frameworks do not prohibit the release of personal 
               information regarding those people who sought their liberation in <name>Senegal</name> from 1857 to 1903. Nonetheless, 
               the ethical issues of naming names remains and the ethical considerations of publishing the names of liberated 
               Africans bears special charge for the historical and sociological reasons enumerated earlier in this article. From an 
               anthropological perspective and within the context of dealing with living informants, <name>Lotte Pelckmans</name> 
               reflects on these issues, especially regarding those who changed their names: <quote rend="block">Finally, there is an 
               ethical dimension that impedes in-depth research and presentation of the data on these issues. Ethically, it is 
               difficult to ask informants discussing name changers to get in touch with those described, since this would be 
               considered a kind of betrayal…. [W]riting and publishing about this group is an ethical dilemma for me and other 
               researchers. As a researcher, I do not want to violate their right to remain invisible 
               <ptr target="#pelckmans2017" loc="277"/>.</quote> While some descendants of enslaved people would prefer to remain 
               forgotten, others struggle against persistent discrimination and the enduring silence regarding the history of 
               enslavement in <name>Senegal</name> and <name>West Africa</name> more generally through political movements and legal 
               suits <ptr target="#rodet2013" loc="27–29"/> <ptr target="#bales2007"/> <ptr target="#hahonou_etal2011"/>

          <head>Conclusion</head>
            <p>In our efforts to use digital humanities to promote social justice and to stimulate wider discussions about the 
               legacies of slavery in order to challenge enduring stigma of an enslaved past and an unequal present, we must be 
               mindful of the politics and ethics of naming the names of enslaved people. But we also must proceed. Enslaved people 
               who actively sought to change their status through the courts, by self-purchase, or by walking to colonial officials 
               to secure certificates of liberty should be recognized for the often-heroic efforts they took to secure their 
               liberation. These enslaved people's actions therefore raise another principle to the ethical consideration of naming 
               names: those enslaved people who actively sought their liberation wanted their new status to be public. The agency of 
               enslaved people in seeking pathways to freedom should therefore be considered when determining whether to name names.
            </p>
            <p>As befitting any humanistic research project, the core problem of what is to be discovered and analyzed changes as 
               we get deeper into the project and understand better what the issues are and how to resolve them. This has been the 
               case with the Senegal Liberations Project. At the beginning of the project, we wanted to respect the widely cited 
               stigma associated with enslaved descent. But as we developed the project more fully and entered more data, new 
               questions arose, as did new concerns about the harm we may be doing to the nature of our sources (enslaved people who 
               actively sought their liberation). As a result, we adjusted our data entry practices to include names. Including names 
               in our public-facing data and website allows the descendant community the possibility of tracing their ancestors. 
               Including names also promotes the partial reconstruction of individual lives during a time when other kinds of 
               historical records are not available for these purposes. Finally, including names provides human faces to the 
               much-needed political engagement in <name>Senegal</name> and <name>West Africa</name> more widely, emphasizing the 
               need to confront inequalities and social hierarchies inherited from the era of slavery and persisting into the present 
               (see Rodet in this collection).
            </p>
            <p>In so doing, we follow <name>Araujo</name> and <name>Johnson</name> in providing a means for the descendants of 
               enslaved people to find out more about their ancestors. As we go forward with our project and produce a French-version 
               of our website so that those in French West Africa can engage and utilize the data we are presenting, we will need to 
               create a system to solicit feedback from descendants as to whether the posting of the names of their enslaved ancestors 
               is desirable in our public-facing, online project. If not, we could provide anonymity or use a pseudonym on our 
               website. While our Senegalese academic colleagues do not believe that this is necessary, we want to establish an option 
               whereby descendants can request that we disguise the names of their enslaved ancestors. Exactly how to do so remains to 
               be explored (see Hopper in this collection), especially if descendants of enslaved ancestors have differing opinions 
               regarding naming names publicly. This option may fulfill the promise of doing no harm, but it also changes the 
               historical record as presented in this public humanities project. The solution to this issue raises even more 
               political, ethical, and epistemological issues that we must continue to confront.
