               <div class="ptext" id="p1">In the July 2014 <cite class="title italic">Critical Inquiry</cite> special issue devoted
                  to "Comics and Media," editors Patrick Jagoda and Hillary
                  Chute discuss their interest in "meticulous attention to the materiality comics
                  instantiates"
                   [<a class="ref" href="#chute2014">Chute and Jagoda 2014</a>, 1–2]. "Comics and Media" combined articles, interviews,
                  and discussions about comics in textual form with several full-color comics by
                  numerous artists like Alison Bechdel, Lynda Barry, Seth, and Phoebe Gloekner, among
                  others. With such a lineup, the editors felt that the issue should also express
                  "its own commitment to the physical object by publishing at
                  a larger size (7x10) and in full color throughout," to distinguish "it from any other issue in the history of <cite class="title italic">Critical Inquiry</cite>"
                   [<a class="ref" href="#chute2014">Chute and Jagoda 2014</a>]. The issue is a beautiful physical object, with a large fold-out section
                  depicting Chris Ware’s poster to Chute’s 2012 "Comics Philosophy
                  and Practice," a conference at the University of Chicago that provided
                  much of the material for the issue. Ware’s poster, entitled "A
                  CONFERENCE addressing the ART of the EMPATHETIC DOODLE," not only
                  advertises the conference, it uses Ware’s typical form of satire in order to
                  describe the process of becoming a comic artist. "Ruin Your Life, Draw Cartoons! and Doom Yourself to Decades
                  of Grinding Isolation, Solipsism, and Utter Social Disregard"
                   [<a class="ref" href="#ware2014">Ware 2014</a>]. With 97 color plates occupying its 272 pages, a great portion of the book is
                  reserved for color illustration. The finished object was so "eye
                  popping" that digital humanities scholar Matt Kirschenbaum published a
                  photo of the piece on Twitter the day he received the issue [<a href="#figure01">Figure 1</a>, [<a class="ref" href="#kirschenbaum2014">Kirschenbaum 2014</a>]].<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e256">[1]</a></div>

               <div class="ptext" id="p2">The brilliant physical presentation of "Comics and Media"
                  created several problems for its digital archiving and dissemination. University of
                  Chicago Press lists the price of the physical book at $30.00, while amazon.com sells
                  it for $28.50. For academics looking to access the issue electronically, JSTOR
                  publishes each of the articles and images as PDFs. Additionally, a Kindle version
                  of
                  the journal issue is available for $9.99 and it is also archived on Scribd. Each of
                  these editions proves a poor substitute for the tactile fold-out grasped by
                  Kirschenbaum in his tweet, often handling the images as oversized JPGs or
                  downloadable PDFs. The Kindle version offers a larger scrollable image of the
                  poster, and yet the JPG used in that version is not high resolution and quickly
                  pixelates the smaller print abounding on Ware’s strip. JSTOR offers a much better
                  image, but the image also appears on its side when first downloaded and must be
                  rotated. To read Ware’s writing, the resolution must be increased to at least 200%
                  of its original size [<a href="#figure02">Figures 2</a> and <a href="#figure03">3</a>].

               <div class="ptext" id="p3">In addition, many questions emerge about the long-term archiving of the issue. It
                  is
                  largely impossible to search for Ware’s poster by keyword or as a distinct object
                  apart from its placement in the <cite class="title italic">Critical Inquiry</cite> issue.
                  Whereas, for instance, Ware’s panel with Seth, Daniel Clowes, and Charles Burns
                  titled "Graphic Novel Forms Today" is easily accessed on
                  the MLA database with any of a number of subject searches, the poster doesn’t even
                  emerge on an author search for "Ware, Chris." The metadata associated with
                  Ware’s contributions to the issue cover only three general subject terms: "Subject
                  literature: American Literature,"
                  "Period: 1900-2099," and "Genre: Periodicals," in addition to two skimpy
                  topic keywords: "The New Yorker" and "the role of cover illustration."
                  Presumably, most of these keywords refer to Ware’s work providing covers for several
                  issues of <cite class="title italic">The New Yorker</cite>, none of them reflecting the
                  cynicism or the typographic, sequential, and print media brilliance of the fold-out
                  poster. As John Walsh’s description of Comic Book Markup Language shows, the
                  complexities of sequential art require a rich language for keyword searches. "A large corpus of digitized comic books, along with encoded
                  transcriptions and descriptive metadata," Walsh argues, "would allow scholars to search the text of comic books, search for
                  keywords related to topics of interest, search for the appearance of particular
                  characters, or search for works by particular writers and artists." And
                  if such a rich vocabulary is fully exploited, Walsh continues, more complex searches
                  would be possible along with "“other forms of computer processing and computational
                  analysis — based upon structural aesthetic, and informational and
                  documentary features peculiar to the genre of comic books”"
                   [<a class="ref" href="#walsh2012">Walsh 2012</a>].

               <div class="ptext" id="p4">Such complexities are not critiques of Jagoda and Chute’s issue, but they do suggest
                  that however much scholars write about comics and invite authors to discuss comics
                  —
                  a whole set of institutional and technological divisions between the comics
                  industry, digital media, and academia continue to make such collaborations
                  difficult. When we began the process of editing a special issue of <cite class="title italic">Digital Humanities Quarterly</cite> devoted to "Comics as Scholarship," we believed such difficulties were
                  limited to the traditional scholarly preference for working in written text. But we
                  found that we overestimated the ability of digital technology to bridge those
                  divisions. What follows is a discussion of our three-year process editing this issue
                  as an introduction to the opportunities and complexities of producing comics as
                  scholarship, and the role of the digital humanities in either facilitating or
                  resisting such a project. Along the way, we’ll investigate the history of comics
                  studies and its need to justify itself as a literary discourse as symptomatic of the
                  difficulty academia has in considering multimedia as legitimate either as a cultural
                  object or as the modality of discourse. We argue that these difficulties have a
                  central role in understanding the place of multimedia in the digital humanities, and
                  the future of comics as scholarship.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">It is by no means obvious that a special issue tied to the production of comic
                     books belongs in the journal <cite class="title italic">Digital Humanities
                        Quarterly</cite>. Despite many commitments by digital humanities scholars
                     to new forms of scholarly communication, Douglas Eyman and Cheryl Ball point out
                     that the digital humanities continues to largely focus on textual markup and
                     digital archival work. Consequently, "no coherent body of scholarship [exists] that offers a
                     sustained analysis of scholarly multimedia and its growing impact on
                     digital scholarship in the humanities"
                      [<a class="ref" href="#eyman2015">Eyman and Ball 2015</a>]. In fact the most promising scholarship on the affordances of comics as a
                     form of communication comes from the field of multimodal composition. Dale
                     Jacobs, for instance, explores comics as a unique method for teaching multimodal
                     literacy and draws from the New London Group’s suggestion that, in Jacob’s
                     words, a "burgeoning variety of text forms associated with
                     information and media technologies" require a broader definition of
                     literacy and writing [<a class="ref" href="#jacobs2013">Jacobs 2013</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#nlg1996">New London Group 1996</a>]. Further, Emily Wierszewski underlines the importance
                     of producing comics for teaching multimodality to students, suggesting that the
                     process develops "a working understanding of commonly used
                     conventions [...] and the attendant values and effects" involved in
                     modalities that use a variety of images to tell a story [<a class="ref" href="#wierszewski2014">Wierszewski 2014</a>]. While both Jacobs and Wierszewski focus on
                     students and media production, they do not apply the practices to the production
                     of scholarship — both of which are written mostly in scholarly prose with few
                     illustrations. Elizabeth Losh, Joshua Alexander, Alexander Canon, and Zander

                     novel caused them to rethink many assumptions they had about scholarly
                     communication. Alexander explains that while "graphic books
                     are often narratively driven through dialogue," he and Losh found
                     themselves "relying heavily on text bubbles that narrated in
                     a 'universal' voice." Instead of using the graphic
                     form to illustrate the rhetorical lessons in the book, they were using "expository communication," consequently "[e]ntire chapters had to be rewritten to recast our exposition
                     into dialogue"
                     [<a class="ref" href="#losh2013">Losh, Alexander, Cannon and Cannon 2013</a>]. While considering the various affordances of
                     different modalities of scholarly communication, these composition scholars have
                     been able to use comics both as a pedagogical aid and as a communicative device
                     for exploring different forms of expression.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p7">Still, for all of the commitment to the sequentiality and visual rhetoric of
                     comics, scholarship has yet to fully account for the remediation of comics as a
                     digital form. Many digital comics are direct translations of print, but
                     digitizing comics offers the opportunity to embed additional information, a
                     point Jaime Lee Kirtz illustrates in her study of paratextual elements like the
                     image processing that occurs when comics are made using Adobe Photoshop or
                     hyperlinks embedded in Kindle and iBook versions of comics that connect readers
                     to information about characters and creators [<a class="ref" href="#kirtz2014">Kirtz 2014</a>]. The
                     relationship of comics with digital modalities has primarily been focused on the
                     web as a medium for distribution that allows for niche and independent comics
                     outside of traditional publishing models, taking the zine scene and its direct
                     distribution to the amplified modality of the web. Many comics produced for the
                     web are commonly referred to as "webcomics" thanks to their
                     mode of distribution, but as a medium they only rarely take advantage of what
                     the digital form offers them. Such webcomics typically take their formal
                     constraints either from the daily newspaper (as in Scott Kurtz’s <cite class="title italic">PvP</cite>, Ryan North’s <cite class="title italic">Dinosaur
                        Comics</cite>, Mike Krahulik and Jerry Holkins’s <cite class="title italic">Penny
                        Arcade</cite>, and Nicholas Gurewitch’s <cite class="title italic">Perry Bible
                        Fellowship</cite>), while others use the page layout of comic books
                     (Brennan Lee Mulligan and Molly Ostertag’s <cite class="title italic">Strong Female
                        Protagonist</cite>, R.K. Milholland’s <cite class="title italic">Something
                        Positive</cite> and Katie Cook’s <cite class="title italic">Gronk</cite>). Scott
                     McCloud famously proposed that comics would abandon the metaphor of the page
                     thanks to digital affordances in 2000, when he suggested that the screen could
                     act as an "infinite canvas"
                      [<a class="ref" href="#mccloud2000">McCloud 2000</a>]. The continued popularity of comics online that could just as easily be
                     conveyed in print seems to contradict Scott McCloud’s vision.

                     cases, less obvious: comics such as <cite class="title italic">Willis’s
                        Shortpacked</cite>, for instance, use mouseover text to add a second
                     punchline to the comic [<a class="ref" href="#willis2005">Willis 2005</a>]. Zach Whalen has noted that
                     many webcomics make use of additional integrated elements of interactivity or
                     animation, like those of the Korean artist Horang, who programs webcomics that
                     take hold "of the browser’s scroll function" and move
                     "rapidly through a series of carefully juxtaposed
                     images" in order to startle their viewers [<a class="ref" href="#whalen2012">Whalen 2012</a>]. One of the most notable examples of an animated comic that takes advantage
                     of the digital medium is Andrew Hussie’s <cite class="title italic">Homestuck</cite>
                     [<a class="ref" href="#hussie2009">Hussie 2009</a>]. The comic has included a range of multimodal
                     aspects (GIFs, chat logs, and Flash games and animations) and has a very strong
                     fan following. The story concerns a video game discovered by a group of
                     teenagers, and a Kickstarter campaign was funded to produce a video game around
                     the comic’s narrative. Such successes demonstrate that the addition of the web
                     modality to the comic form can transform the core interaction of the experience.
                     The interactive approach taken by Hussie in <cite class="title italic">Homestuck</cite> does not much resemble Scott McCloud’s prediction of a
                     comics form that would break out of the traditional page: while sections of the
                     comic are experimental and hybrid, the primary approach is still very much a
                     printed comic page. El Santo critiqued Scott McCloud’s proposal for the future
                     of comics by suggesting that an infinite canvas or scrollable page provides "too much information at once in a medium that’s
                     drowning in it"
                      [<a class="ref" href="#elsanto2009">El Santo 2009</a>].

                  <div class="ptext" id="p9">Yet despite this criticism there are several examples of scrolling comics,
                     including Emily Carroll’s "His Face All Red" (2010),
                     a vertical scrolling comic depicting a wolf hunt; and Drew Weing’s "'Pup' Ponders the Heat Death of the Universe"
                     (2003), which employs scrolling in both directions for exploring the scale of
                     the universe. These resemble Scott McCloud’s own infinite canvas comics, which
                     include his own meta-series of "Can’t Stop Thinking"
                     comics reflecting on the practice itself. Randall Munroe’s "xkcd" comics have offered some of the most compelling examples of
                     where these forms might lead. Munroe’s "Click and
                     Drag", for instance uses an infinite canvas contained within a single

                     had an explorable panel ranging from space to underground and offering so much

                     and geeky programming humor. One frame, for instance, says "If you’re fencepost errors I feel bad for you, son — I
                     got 99 problems but somehow solved 101"
                      [<a class="ref" href="#munroe2012a">Munroe 2012a</a>]. Fencepost problems point to simple errors where intuitive solutions to
                     programming problems might be one or two values off. The comic caused many
                     conversations online, and perhaps the most contested revolved around how Munroe
                     created it. Several readers thought that he simply created a programming script
                     that distinguished the space below and above the horizon, and filled those
                     spaces with black and white respectively. They expected, in other words, that
                     clicking on individual tiles would return a 404 error saying that they did not
                     exist on any server and were spontaneously generated by the script. Luis Montes
                     reports on a Google Plus post that he used HTML 5 canvas to stitch the tiles
                     together and reconstruct the image as a whole. "Firefox and
                     Chrome both barfed on 225 (non-empty) huge tiles," Montes says, "so i had to scale them down first with mogrify to 64x64
                     to even paint the thing on a 5120x2048 canvas"

                     commentators surrounding "Click and Drag" point to
                     the power comics have to reach multiple audiences, particularly when they are
                     enhanced with digital technology. Munroe’s "Time"
                     shows yet another possibility, in which he embeds 3,099 images in a single panel
                     that changed every thirty minutes. The comic inspired a devoted community that
                     followed the story as it unfolded from March to July 2013, complete with
                     messages in a writing system called "Beanish" that
                     followers had to decipher. The actions of those readers and their intense study
                     of the comic’s embedded texts and backstory are not unlike the labors of a
                     digital humanities project — with the forum conversation surrounding the comic
                     exceeding over 1,300 pages of commentary. An entire conversation emerged on the
                     xkcd forum when the first panel appeared on March 25, with the first poster
                     "rhomboidal" commenting that the comic seemed to communicate the idea "that while time might appear to be a strictly linear
                     phenomenon, its manifestation as life is actually a profoundly open,
                     richly holistic, poly-temporal intercreative experience with many
                     points, narratives, and interpretations as there are participants in

                     that followed, serves as a powerful commentary on the way digital comics can
                     inspire further creative expression. One fan, James Pryor, was inspired enough
                     to create "Time — at your own pace" in which the
                     panels of the comic could be scrolled through using a mouse-wheel instead of
                     relying on the time-based algorithm of the original comic. Fans also produced a
                     wiki-guide to the comic, a glossary of the world and its inhabitants, and wrote
                     songs relating to its themes [<a class="ref" href="#pryor2013">Pryor 2013</a>].

                     is worth noting that many of the creators working with digital comics are
                     careful to separate such artifacts from animation or other digital media. Comic
                     author Mark Waid, one of the more vocal digital comic enthusiasts, argues that
                     "the only place I stop short is at the addition of
                     voice, music, or anything else that takes the full and total control of time
                     away from the reader," which he feels is an "essential" and "inviolate" element of
                     comic books. Of course, Waid’s distinction would rule out comics like xkcd’s
                     "Time," and yet even Lara Hudson — commenting on
                     Munroe’s comic — argues that the temporality of the piece was "glacially slow for animation, but imbued with a continual
                     sense of motion that felt utterly unique for a comic." It is clear
                     from these comments that comics continue to inhabit a liminal space between
                     readerly narratives and animated features that make them difficult to place for
                     creators, critics, and scholars alike.

                     Berkeley in 1972 and at Vanderbilt in 1978, recalls that "Comics were the 'whacko' kinds of things that the news

                     trash man.'" The technological situation at Berkeley
                     also lead to situations in which finding and distributing comics became
                     increasingly difficult:

                  <div class="ptext" id="p15">The idea for this issue was born out of a 2012 THATCamp session proposed by
                     Anastasia and attended by Roger entitled "Comic Books +
                     Playing with Scholarship"
                     [<a class="ref" href="#salter2012">Salter 2012</a>]. THATCamp has traditionally been an entry point for
                     many scholars into digital humanities discourse, making it a particularly
                     productive ground for interdisciplinary projects and experimentation. The
                     THATCamp Comic Books session was inspired by existing examples of comics that
                     act as scholarship, a tradition best known through the work of Scott McCloud and
                     exemplified by some of the work in Jagoda and Chute’s "Comics and Media" issue. Other examples can be productively drawn
                     from outside of typical academic discourse. Art Spiegelman’s <cite class="title italic">MetaMaus,</cite> and, indeed, the historical and journalistic
                     work of <cite class="title italic">Maus</cite> itself, is frequently cited as a
                     central text on the Holocaust and the ultimate example of a comic book that
                     transcended genre to be hailed as a canonical text. In a similar vein of
                     intertwining journalism and scholarship, Mary Talbot and Bryan Talbot’s <cite class="title italic">Dotter of her Father’s Eyes</cite> examines the life and
                     influence of James Joyce’s daughter Lucia. Bryan Talbot is well-known for his
                     graphic epic <cite class="title italic">Alice in Sunderland</cite>, a work that
                     combines fiction, history, and myth to consider <cite class="title italic">Alice in
                        Wonderland</cite> as part of a web of literature.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p16">From these initial influences, those of us gathered at THATCamp CHNM discussed a
                     potential moment of convergence for scholars interested in comics as a form for
                     production as well as analysis. First, while journals specializing in
                     alternative forms like <cite class="title italic">Kairos: A Journal of Rhetoric,
                        Technology, and Pedagogy</cite> and <cite class="title italic">M/C: Media and
                        Culture</cite> have existed for some time, the rise of interest in open
                     access and alternative publishing in the humanities that correspond with the
                     needs of DH scholars makes publishing a work in comic form a greater possibility
                     than perhaps ever before. Second, more accessible forms of digital production
                     tools make the act of creating multimedia works easier. For instance, Roopika
                     Risam, Anne Cong-Huyen, and Adeline Koh employed the comic application Bitstrips
                     to produce short, humorous, and rapid postcolonial interventions into the
                     digital humanities community [<a href="#figure06">Figure 6</a>].

                     expressions with a relatively limited amount of character poses and emotive
                     choices. In "Postcolonial #DH, No. 6" Risam uses
                     humor and different forms of technology to enact Audre Lorde’s well-known
                     critique of Franz Fanon’s optimism regarding the use of "the
                     master’s tools" to contest colonialism. As Lorde argues, "the master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s
                     house. They may allow us temporarily to beat him at his own game, but
                     they will never enable us to bring about genuine change"
                      [<a class="ref" href="#lorde1984">Lorde 1984</a>]. The optimism shown by the characters in the strip soon turns to
                     frustration, with Risam rolling on the floor overwhelmed by "too. much. css"
                      [<a class="ref" href="#risam2013">Risam 2013</a>]. Aaron Kashtan, whose work is featured in this issue, sees Bitstrips
                     enabling his own practice-based experimentation in comic studies and media
                     studies. Connecting its use to a "long tradition of using
                     the comics medium to theorize itself" epitomized by Scott McCloud’s
                     <cite class="title italic">Understanding Comics</cite> and Wil Eisner’s <cite class="title italic">Comics and Sequential Art</cite>, Kashtan says that "my artistic talent is very limited and [...] without
                     tools such as Bitstrips and Comic Life, it would be prohibitively
                     difficult for me to engage in this sort of theoretical
                     exploitation"
                      [<a class="ref" href="#kashtan2013">Kashtan 2013</a>]. While Kashtan's work suggests that such tools can make the visual and
                     symbolic rhetoric of comics accessible to the "non-artist," it is also a
                     reminder that when the medium theorizes itself it will likely be evaluated on
                     aesthetics alongside scholarship.

                     communication to produce their dissertations. Nick Sousanis wrote his
                     dissertation as a comic and documented the process on his blog <cite class="title italic">Spin, Weave, and Cut</cite> from 2010-2014. In his article
                     "The Shape of our Thoughts: A Meditation In/On
                     Comics," Sousanis uses the form of a cross-word puzzle to discuss the
                     non-linearity of comics and their power to lead the reader to unexpected
                     insights not available in written prose [<a href="#figure07">Figure 7</a>,

                  <div class="ptext" id="p19">This page eloquently shows how the linear reading of text, signified by the comet
                     slowly floating down the page, breaks up in a myriad of visual and verbal
                     digressions. Each narrative box works modularly to compose different potential
                     readings of the page. We learn that "the verbal is
                     overprivileged as the only path to serious thought" and this could
                     lead to "a single strand" and "narrows our sight," but our eye could also move to "other routes" or any of the scientific studies or
                     images featured on the page. The overall effect points to Theirry Groensteen’s
                     argument that comics are defined by "iconic
                     solidarity," which means, "independent images that, participating in a series,
                     present the double characteristic of being separated [...] and which are
                     plastically and semantically over-determined by the fact of their
                     coexistence in presentia"
                      [<a class="ref" href="#groensteen2007">Groensteen 2007</a>]. In Groensteen’s definition, it is the very fact that images are
                     presented together that makes it possible for them to be read sequentially and
                     not, for example, as a mosaic or as a single composition. Sousanis’s page plays
                     with the tension between the sequentiality and the simultaneity of the comic
                     page in order to show how ideas can be splintered apart and then combined into
                     new regions of thought. Sousanis produced a prose discussion of his process for
                     this issue, where he further uncovers the complexities and possibilities of the
                     comic form for scholarship. His dissertation is also now available as the book
                     <cite class="title italic">Unflattening</cite> from Harvard University Press [<a class="ref" href="#sousanis2015">Sousanis 2015</a>]. Jason Helms, whose work appears in this issue as
                     well, also wrote a dissertation that employs comics throughout. As a
                     “non-artist,” Helms began taking drawing classes in 2008 as part of his research
                     methodology, and defended his dissertation, <cite class="title italic">Rhiz|comics:
                        the Structure, Sign, and Play of Image and Text</cite>, in 2010. Helms’s
                     dissertation is less of a "pure" comic than Sousanis’s. It
                     features sections that look and feel like comics, but much of the dissertation
                     consists of text punctuated and interrupted by visual elements (the conclusion,
                     for example, is written entirely as calligrams). However, this is hardly an
                     oversight and reflects his argument for blurring the lines between comics and
                     other media and between image and text. Helms has rewritten his dissertation as
                     a digital monograph for the University of Michigan Press’s Sweetland Digital
                     Rhetoric Collaborative imprint, where it is currently under review.

                     asked his students to create a 22-page comic book. Students spent the semester
                     pitching a title, researching audiences and comic genres, writing, illustration,
                     and finally publishing a comic book that they presented to members of the
                     University community in a comic faire.

                     different panel arrangements and — as the example above skillfully shows — the
                     effect of juxtaposing different artistic styles with one another [<a href="#figure08">Figure 8</a>]. Here, we see Mark Price’s use of heavy
                     inks and wild composition contrasted with the relatively clean white and grey
                     space of the monitor screen. Fred Johnson discusses a similar project utilizing
                     comics by art-teacher Scott Kolbo in his article "Perspicuous Objects: Reading Comics and Writing Instruction."
                     Kolbo’s project had students draw "themselves in two different styles and observ[e] the
                     differences"
                      [<a class="ref" href="#johnson2014">Johnson 2014</a>]. Both Johnson and Kolbo found that their students had difficulties with
                     basic aspects of sequential art like the use of images to communicate the
                     sadness of Chris Ware’s <cite class="title italic">Jimmy Corrigan: The Smartest Kid on
                        Earth</cite> or the way particular artistic styles might denote specific
                     emotional states. We’ll discuss how some of these difficulties extend to
                     scholars producing their own comics later on. The study of comics as an art form
                     is popular amongst various community organizations like Gainesville, Florida’s
                     Sequential Artists Workshop where courses on the history of comics taught by
                     scholar John Ronan are combined with workshops led by local artists Justine
                     Maria Anderson, Tom Hart, and Kurt Wolfgang. In an article about SAW in the
                     magazine <cite class="title italic">Gainesville Today</cite>, Hart describes students
                     learning in a variety of media to understand sequential art including musical
                     compositions, literature, opera and theater, and visual art. "Learning certain techniques will allow you to break those
                     rules later," Hart says. "Our main goal in this medium is clarity above all else
                     at least at this stage of their learning"

                     understanding comics from broader interdisciplinary perspectives and for a

                     dissertations and monographs, and teaching pedagogies. Our discussions at
                     THATCamp included many more of these examples, but we found no systematic
                     consideration of how they fit into the scholarship of our various fields. Our
                     purpose in creating this issue grew out of a desire to find a place to

                     scholarly communication, and also to explore the process necessary for creating,

                     on Photoshop. The "0 cents" is cropped from the digitized cover of <cite class="title italic">Detective Comics</cite> #27, which originally sold for 10
                     cents. Finally the font was chosen directly from GIMP’s font library. Connecting
                     the banner to the images prepared by Anastasia was complicated due to the
                     varying styles and methodologies of both of the editors. It was unclear how
                     hand-drawn images, digitally-processed type fonts, and filters would work
                     together to create a clean, readerly design. Further, as neither Anastasia nor
                     myself are trained comic artists, we felt some reluctance towards presenting our
                     CFP as sequential art. We also wondered if scholars would take the call
                     seriously. Anastasia, therefore, posted a call in traditional prose in addition
                     to the one rendered in sequential art. The text call was easier to distribute in
                     scholarly venues, including email lists and CFP sites, as the rendered version
                     presented both a large file size and difficulties for those mediums. The comic
                     CFP took some time to produce, a lesson we’d integrate into the submission and
                     revision process for the issue [<a class="ref" href="#salter2014">Salter and Whitson 2014</a>].

                     labor-intensive process involved in constructing sequential images that produce

                     produce a typical 22-page issue for a monthly book:

                           My overall monthly schedule looks like this: The first
                           week and a half of an issue is spent laying out the issue via
                           thumbnails, then penciling the whole thing out. The two weeks after that
                           are spent inking the pages in groups of two. Then, the last week is
                           spent coloring. My color assistant Taylor Wells sends me the flat colors
                           for the issue, and from there I add texture, lighting, shadow and
                           special effects to the page. So, in the end, it always seems to round
                           out to about 5 weeks per issue.

                     </blockquote> Understanding this process and the fact that Guillory is one of the most
                     efficient professional artists in the industry, we knew that we couldn’t ask for
                     finished comics as first drafts. First, asking for finished drafts would mean
                     that the potential authors would have to invest a significant amount of time
                     before getting any feedback from the editors. Second, if the author was rejected
                     from the issue after producing finished drafts, we knew that it would be
                     relatively difficult for the work to be accepted elsewhere. In consultation with
                     <cite class="title italic">DHQ</cite> editor Julia Flanders, we decided to ask
                     for abstracts in the first round, scripts and penciled layouts in the second
                     round (involving outside reviewers), then — if accepted by the reviewers — we
                     would ask for a finished comic book for the final draft.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p25">Even with these failsafes in place, we had numerous complications. Five
                     contributors pulled out of the issue at various stages. Outside reviewers,
                     meanwhile, had a number of conflicting and confusing responses to the drafts.
                     Some were concerned that the comics were in a less-than-complete state. Others
                     didn’t understand how the submissions were contributing to the field of digital
                     humanities. Flimsy research and a lack of a critical lens were often cited
                     problems. One reviewer suggested that using comics to make an argument about
                     research is very similar to the work of Scott McCloud, and that the use of humor
                     to make a scholarly argument may be inappropriate. Reviewers critiqued
                     everything from the exuberance of using too many exclamation points to the lack
                     of an original argument, the use of populist appeals to ground claims, and the
                     lack of a bibliography or Works Cited page. We mention these issues not to
                     critique the review process, which significantly added to the quality of the
                     submissions. Rather, we wish to underscore just how complicated producing comics
                     can be, and the way certain modalities of scholarship can create unexpected —
                     and perhaps unwanted — opportunities for different effects. Is it appropriate to
                     use humor in order to assert a scholarly claim? Can quotations and citations be
                     managed using visual references rather than bibliographical or textual ones?
                     Such questions invigorated but also complicated the process of producing the
                     issue.

                     an annotated discussion of his dissertation, required the least amount of work.
                     In sum, it was difficult at first for Sousanis to completely contextualize his
                     argument for broader audiences. Given that he produced the piece in a Word

                     producing the first comic as a dissertation to be a highlight of the issue.
                     Sousanis explores "Chapter 3" of his dissertation, in
                     which he outlines the possibilities of multiple modes of knowledge. One
                     particular point of interest involves Sousanis’s self-reflexive discussion of
                     producing a single page of his dissertation. When asked if he produces words or
                     pictures first, he simply replies "yes." Sousanis
                     writes notes and sketches simultaneously, then moves to a script, then a
                     storyboard, then revisions and drawing again. Sousanis’s words meld with their
                     images and produce sequential argumentation.

                     as one of the first pieces of comic art [<a class="ref" href="#mccloud1993">McCloud 1993</a>]. Helms

                     decided that streamlining the theoretical sections and highlighting Helms’s
                     digital artistry in the tapestry section would produce a better result. The
                     first draft of the sample image, further, featured a less-than-clear serif font.
                     A sans-serif combined with a CSS roll-over images that highlight the dialogue
                     and narrative balloons lead to greater readability.

                     compellingly into the visualization of comics history. Richard Burt has
                     suggested that films appropriating the Tapestry into their opening and closing
                     sequences have used it to simulate the "texture" of the
                     medieval past and that such a simulation can point us to the idea that all
                     histories are mediated by the material modes of their presentation [<a class="ref" href="#burt2007">Burt 2007</a>]. To be sure, the presentation of comics history has a
                     more recent self-reflexive history than the fields of film or literary
                     scholarship. Fred Van Lente and Ryan Dunlavey, for instance, produced a <cite class="title italic">Comic Book History of Comics</cite> that tells the story in
                     sequential art [<a class="ref" href="#lente2012">Lente and Dunlavey 2012</a>]. Yet, Helms reminds us how often the
                     particular material affordances of comic history can often be overlooked in a
                     world where comics are produced in single issue floppies, trade paperbacks, and
                     digital formats.

                     highlights these affordances. Kashtan was enthusiastic about the project, yet
                     also had anxieties about producing art for a scholarly publication. Most of his
                     project emerged from early experiments with Bitstrips [<a href="#figure12">Figure 12</a>].

                     images, comic panels, and internet memes. While emphasizing the ability of
                     sequential art to highlight different materialities, Kashtan found his style by
                     combining those different modes into a unique collage.

                     N. Katherine Hayles’s notion of a materiality that combines matter with human
                     signifying strategies to Matt Kirschenbaum’s distinction of forensic and formal
                     materiality and Jane Bennett’s theory of a vibrant matter, in which non-human

                     showing how comics "forcibly alert the reader to the
                     physicality of the reading experience," in Kashtan’s words, asserting
                     that comic books are a vital object of study for anyone interested in the
                     history of the book, philosophy, media studies, or the digital humanities.

                     more time-consuming and labor intensive than typing an article on a word
                     processor, but he wanted to give the sense that the lettering was inseparable
                     from the images he produced. The result is a piece in which words are also
                     objects that Humphrey places in different parts of the page for different visual
                     effects.

                     group for later revisions, Humphrey crafted a powerful piece comparing the
                     inseparability of different modalities of communication in comics to a division
                     of labor that demands different experts work on each part. He also underlined
                     his point by having his images and text respond to one another, and by asking
                     how such divisions might work to challenge the educational hegemony that sees
                     printed texts as more learned [<a class="ref" href="#kress2001">Kress 2001</a>]

                     as a collaborator to do the art, coding, and web design. As they revised their
                     piece, Watkins and Lindsley also added a more diverse set of examples to back up
                     their claims about rhetoric and comics. Watkins and Lindsley also translated
                     their earlier drawings to HTML5. For us, the piece exemplifies a different
                     aspect of comics history and analysis than the other submissions because it
                     highlights the work of ancient rhetoric in contextualizing and shaping comics

                     serve as an alternative to the essay format. This multimodal approach takes
                     advantage of existing tools and grounding in rhetoric to explore sequential art
                     as a method for communicating both the process and results of a scholarly

                     Studies scholar <span class="hi bold">B.J. Parker</span>, who traces some of the
                     intersections between gender and Judaism in Ezekiel. Unlike many of the other
                     contributors, Parker wanted to construct a fictional narrative out of scholarly
                     sources. The ambition of the piece was matched by early images that were clearly
                     polished and showed a degree of artistic skill [<a href="#figure15">Figure
                        15</a>].

                        </div>
                     </div> Parker integrates scholarly debates around Ezekiel directly into the
                     narrative. Parker’s initial proposal focused on exploring sexual objectification
                     in Ezekial 16 through multimodal presentations, including this development of
                     sequential art. Given that focus, the piece deals with subject matter that we
                     don’t always engage with in digital humanities, and some of the reactions to the
                     early stages of the piece focused on apprehending and responding to the
                     disturbing subject matter. However, these responses and the difficulties the
                     piece poses are essential to Parker’s intentions, as Parker’s work demands we
                     engage with elements of the text that have otherwise often been erased.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p38">This concept of a scholarly retelling thus resembles the work of creating an
                     annotated edition, with Parker’s annotations expressed both through the editing
                     of the text and the juxtaposition of original imagery. Comic retellings are
                     often thought of as simplifications of the original text, an impression that
                     holds within it an underlying bias towards sequential art as a mode of narrative
                     expression. The <cite class="title italic">Classic Illustrated</cite> series, which
                     Parker’s work of adaptation evokes, was often dismissed despite its value: as
                     William B. Jones, Jr. describes in his survey of the series "What <cite class="title italic">Classics Illustrated</cite>
                     and its offspring did with increasing skill between 1941 and 1962, when
                     original-title production ceased, was to make the realms of the literary
                     and historical imagination accessible and immediate"
                      [<a class="ref" href="#jones2011">Jones 2011</a>]. Parker’s work likewise makes the original text, and the debates and
                     cultural discourse it evokes, accessible in a way that highlights and
                     recontextualizes its place in religious discourse.

                     particularly to consider the scholarly process that is on display and the
                     opportunities we have in the digital humanities to embrace and refine these
                     processes. Each work represents the different strengths of its author(s) in
                     modality, use of original and remixed imagery, and textual methods. These works
                     only display a small section of what is possible in the broad realm that can be
                     analyzed as sequential art or comics. The history of humanities computing,
                     broadly construed, is filled with multimodal works: however, we are still at our
                     infancy in truly building spaces that are receptive to new methods, with systems
                     of peer review that encourage innovation and experimentation. The challenges we
                     faced in constructing this issue are a reminder that while the academic essay
                     and monograph are entrenched structures with strong institutional support, the
                     scholarly multimedia text is still emerging.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p40">The practice of critiquing and understanding a mode of expression better through
                     working within its medium is not new, and we are not suggesting that comics are
                     a new method for the digital humanities or even that multimodal texts aren’t
                     already embraced in a number of spaces, such as the fields of digital rhetoric
                     and multimedia composition. However, there is a chasm between what is possible
                     in sequential art as an act of scholarship and what is supported and
                     institutionalized. We showcase these works as a provocation for building new
                     scholarly spaces and experimenting with multimedia research within the digital
                     humanities. We also suggest that these experiments form one part of Johanna
                     Drucker’s call in <cite class="title italic">Graphesis: Visual Forms of Knowledge
                        Production</cite> for an approach towards digital technology that
                     acknowledges the complex research in the humanities surrounding perspective and
                     point-of-view [<a class="ref" href="#drucker2014">Drucker 2014</a>]. As scholars consider the various
                     ways the culturally-rich forms of knowledge from the humanities can nuance
                     claims made by computational methodologies like big data visualization, it helps
                     to realize that all sorts of experiments with visual perception already exist in
                     the form of sequential art. Apart from simply communicating with comics, "Comics as Scholarship" also points to a possible future
                     for the digital humanities where data analysis is made even richer by modifying
                     temporal sequence, shifting points of view, or varying the style in which
                     visualizations are presented. More generally, such experiments can suggest that
                     studying comics may prove to be a fundamental part of understanding the digital
                     humanities in the future.

                  affective response parallels Alvaro Aleman’s observation that comic book
                  publishers have historically constructed a variety of packaging strategies in
                  order to lure customers into their shops, including "plastic sealed issues, glossy, foiled and three
                  dimensional covers, commemorative editions, etc"
                   [<a class="ref" href="#aleman2005">Aleman 2005</a>]. This, for Aleman, is a "revirginizing"
                  experience in which a capitalist subject is confronted by the "'yielding' of the comic book to sensual
                  experience" as a form of consumption offering private control of the
                  otherwise chaotic modernist experience of temporality.

                  cultural alignment of comics with children’s literature, inspires many
                  articles that declare comics are finally coming into their own, growing up,
                  or otherwise being accepted as literature. See, for instance, Peter
                  Schjeldahl’s article in <cite class="title italic">The New Yorker</cite>, where
                  he uses the work of Chris Ware to declare "Graphic
                  Novels Come of Age," or Hillary Chute’s column in <cite class="title italic">PMLA</cite>, where she indicates that "[c]omics — once considered pure junk — is sparking
                  interest in literary studies"

                  [<a class="ref" href="#chute2008">Chute 2008</a>]. Neither of these critics acknowledge the long
                  tradition of comics scholarship stretching back decades and including work
                  by figures like Ault or David Kunzle, the latter of whom published his

                  "literariness" of comics is particularly interesting
                  since the word in question has nothing to do with the technological
                  affordances of the literary medium, and everything to do with what Rocco
                  Versaci identifies in his students as a sensibility defined by works "whose importance is beyond question"

                  collection of Carl Barks, whom Ault befriended and collaborated with for
                  decades before Barks’s death in 2000. As he recounts, "This theft led to Carl Barks stamping the covers of
                  all of his comic books with this message: ‘This is the personal file
