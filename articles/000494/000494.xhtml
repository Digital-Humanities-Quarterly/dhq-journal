                  <p>This essay explores the challenges of using “the digital,” both scholarly and
                     pedagogically, for understanding and analyzing colonial Latin American art. It argues
                     that digital art history (DAH) tools and methods offer new ways to think about the
                     non-neutrality of how we access, collect, and understand information discovered
                     online. Specifically, it focuses on responses to questionnaire and the development
                     of
                     a collaborative Omeka project (involving students) to consider how knowledge is
                     produced in the digital environment. It reflects on issues of digital and visual
                     epistemology, digital visuality, the ontology of art history, accessibility, and
                     neocolonialism, and how these topics have been broached with undergraduate students
                     in a class focused on Spanish colonial art.

                  pedagógicamente, para comprender y analizar el arte colonial latinoamericano. Sostiene
                  que las herramientas y los métodos de la historia del arte digital (DAH) ofrecen nuevas

               <div class="ptext" id="p4">Digital visual media, such as images and videos, form an inescapable cornerstone of
                  our
                  lived experience. For those of us in higher education, the digital is altering not
                  only
                  how and what we research but also how and what we teach. In a similar vein as other
                  specializations, the study of colonial Latin American art is being transformed. Art
                  historians, finely attuned to the visual world and the meaning-making processes
                  informing it, seem uniquely positioned to engage with and critique the digital realm
                  that we increasingly inhabit and to teach digital, visual literacy.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e206">[1]</a></div>
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p5"> Despite art historians’ possible role to play in shaping and framing the digital
                  world,
                  there is still an ambivalence about what the digital turn has to offer art history.
                  An
                  assessment of the impact of “the digital,” and more specifically the digital
                  humanities (DH) and digital art history (DAH), on the field of art history reveals
                  that
                  there are those who believe the digital turn has the potential to positively disrupt
                  it
                  (e.g., Honig 2018) and those who feel it has the potential to problematically disturb
                  it
                  (e.g., Bishop 2015). Regardless of where an individual’s position falls on this
                  spectrum, the digital is here to stay, and it is reinventing art history and the manner
                  in which we access, engage with, asses, and frame visual culture. One wonders, as
                  Nuria
                  Rodríguez-Ortega (2013b) has, if Donald Preziosi (1991) could have imagined the impact
                  the digital would have on how we “rethink art history,” a suggestion he first made
                  about
                  the art-historical discipline in the wake of post-structuralist and post-modern
                  critiques of art and the (im)possibility of stable meaning.
               </div>
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p6">For all these reasons, it is important that we equip ourselves with the ability to
                  understand how the digital frames or reframes our understanding of visual culture
                  and to
                  effectively critique it. As art historians know all too well, framing devices construct
                  a visual rhetoric, one that creates certain “epistemological and methodological
                  assumptions,” in the words of Elli Doulkaridou (2015, 69). Something as seemingly
                  simple
                  as substituting, in class, a high-resolution gigapixel panoramic 360° photo of the
                  church of San Pablo de Ocongate in Peru (MAVCOR 2018) for a flat megapixel one can
                  alter
                  perception, experience, and belief about the object or space that the digital image
                  indexes. The digital turn has thus prompted shifts in how we see the world and the
                  ways
                  in which we consume and produce knowledge. In the digital environment in which we
                  increasingly live, learn, and, for those of us in the classroom, teach, it has become
                  clear that we must consider digital technology as epistemology (Schilling 2014;
                  Rodríguez-Ortega 2010). Digital media is, as Yehuda Kalay states, not neutral, but
                  creates, shapes, and disseminates knowledge in different ways than a hardbound book,
                  a
                  DVD, or a lecture delivered in a classroom. Similarly, Rodríguez-Ortega advises us
                  to be
                  mindful about how we perceive of the digital realm — not as a “neutral, innocuous
                  space
                  that delivers information” but as a “cultural, political, and ideological venue” (2013a,
                  132).<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e224">[2]</a>

               <div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p7">For these reasons it is imperative to think about not only the technological tools
                  needed to engage in digital practices and meaning-making, but also the critical tools
                  needed to think about what content to produce and how to produce it. I would add to
                  this
                  that we also need the critical tools to think about, assess, and communicate what
                  and
                  how we experience and interact with (i.e. what we consume) online. Even those of us
                  who
                  do not intend to make DAH tools or projects will encounter and use them, and most
                  if not
                  all art historians now employ digitized images for our teaching and research. The
                  very
                  way these digitized images are aggregated and framed has the potential to shift our
                  field — ontologically, epistemologically, and pedagogically.

               <div class="ptext" id="p8">This essay grapples with some of the complexities that the digital poses for those
                  of us
                  who teach and research colonial Latin American art. It asks a number of questions:
                  In
                  what ways can DAH methods and tools, as well as digitized visual materials, help us
                  to
                  think more critically or differently about visual culture? What challenges exist when
                  working with digital images, tools, and methods?<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e233">[3]</a>
                  To explore these questions, I draw on responses to a questionnaire and my own
                  pedagogical experiences. The questionnaire gathered information about how others in
                  the
                  field of colonial Latin American art history approach the digital in their pedagogy
                  and
                  research. These responses serve as a launching point for a broader discussion of the
                  ramifications of DAH pedagogy and research as it relates to the visual culture of
                  colonial Latin America.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e236">[4]</a> Also serving as a springboard to wrestling with these issues are my
                  own experiences with DAH pedagogy and the challenges it has presented to both me and
                  my
                  students when discussing and analyzing colonial Latin American art. In particular,
                  I
                  describe a course project that asks students to build digital exhibitions about Spanish
                  colonial art using the content management system (CMS) called Omeka (Omeka Team 2018a).
                  Discussions about metadata and the use of digital images prompted the students and
                  me to
                  consider issues of digital and visual epistemology, digital visuality and storytelling,
                  art historical nomenclature, the ontology of art history, digital colonialism and
                  neocolonialism, accessibility, and labor — all in the course of a semester. These
                  considerations aided students in not only thinking more critically about colonial
                  Latin
                  American art, but also developing digital and multimodal literacy with Web 2.0
                  technology.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e239">[5]</a> In focusing on these pedagogical experiences, I hope to
                  highlight some of the greater implications of the digital world for the study of
                  colonial Latin American visual culture and pay heed to how DAH pedagogy can both disrupt
                  and disturb art history.

               <div class="ptext" id="p10">To collect information from other scholars teaching and researching the visual culture

                  anonymously with both quantitative and qualitative questions to develop a mixed-methods
                  approach.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e251">[7]</a> It asked a series of questions
                  about how people teach or research colonial Latin American art using DAH tools or
                  resources, and whether they use DAH projects like Smarthistory or tools like Omeka,
                  and
                  if so, how. It compiled information about how long a participant has taught, the
                  subjects of courses focused on colonial Latin American visual culture, and the
                  orientation of these classes towards DAH or DH.

                  varied from a few words to lengthy paragraphs. Despite this variability, the responses
                  prompted thought-provoking reflection on the role of digitized and digital art history
                  among those of us focused on the visual culture of colonial Latin America. The collected
                  data revealed a number of important concerns, among them (1) the broad way in which
                  individuals define, understand, and use “the digital” when researching or teaching
                  about
                  colonial Latin American visual culture; (2) the perception that digitized and digital
                  art history have the potential to advance the study of Latin American art and to
                  complicate or decenter the canon, even if the specific ways in which this might occur
                  seem vague and undetermined; (3) the importance of access to high-resolution images,
                  archival materials, and scholarship to ease financial burden and collaborate across
                  international borders; and (4) the need for more digital resources or projects, despite
                  the large number of perceived challenges, which include the limitations of digital
                  technologies, the time needed to learn digital tools and skills, and the reliability
                  and
                  trustworthiness of these tools and projects. The remainder of this essay explores
                  these
                  ideas in connection to pedagogical strategies and experiences with digital art history
                  in an undergraduate class focused on colonial Latin American visual culture.

               <div class="ptext" id="p13">The general consensus from the responses on the questionnaire is that working with
                  digital tools and digitized visual materials offers clear benefits to any scholar
                  or
                  student of art history, regardless of their specialization.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e270">[9]</a> These benefits include access to materials from around the globe, the
                  use of high-resolution images for study, the opportunity to create a visual archive
                  of
                  images currently split among international collections, or the invitation to engage
                  with
                  materials more slowly from anywhere at any time. The qualitative responses detailed
                  the
                  various ways respondents felt that DAH had impacted (or could impact) their research,
                  teaching, the field of colonial Latin American art, and art history more generally.
                  Many
                  suggested that DAH provides new ways of interacting with data, helps us to ask new
                  types
                  of questions, and shifts how we understand visual culture. However, most respondents
                  mentioned that they were unsure what these interactions or shifts might look like
                  and
                  whether they were sustainable. When asked if they themselves are active in DAH or
                  DH,
                  42.9% responded yes, 35.7% maybe, and 21.4% no. Written responses suggested that some
                  participants were simply unsure if what they were doing “counted” as DAH; for example,
                  several wondered if using a university’s CMS in their colonial Latin American art
                  classes meant they had familiarity with or practiced DAH. Others noted their reticence
                  to answer ‘yes’ because they were unsure how to define DAH altogether, noting that
                  they
                  could not align themselves with it if they do not know what it is, and if art historians
                  more generally cannot agree how to define it.

                  but
                  this use was more limited pedagogically.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e276">[10]</a> 69.2% answered that
                  their classes are not oriented towards DAH; remaining responses were split between
                  yes
                  and maybe. A follow-up question asked participants to describe those classes that
                  foregrounded, or at least incorporated to some extent, digital methods and tools.
                  Several individuals incorporate textual analysis, mapping, image annotation, or the
                  creation and curation of online projects (such as the development of an online
                  exhibition using Omeka). Most commonly, though, respondents linked students to digital
                  image repositories, essays, and videos from sites like Vistas (Leibsohn and Mundy
                  2015),
                  Smarthistory (2018), and the Metropolitan Museum’s Heilbrunn Timeline (2000–2018).
                  These
                  answers further highlighted the confusion (and in some cases frustration) about how
                  to
                  define or understand DAH or what constitutes doing it or using it in the classroom
                  setting.

               <div class="ptext" id="p15">Digital Art History is one aspect of the Digital Humanities, and both have affected
                  the
                  development of the humanities more broadly. Those engaged with DAH cross disciplinary
                  boundaries, incorporating not only art history and computer science, but also media
                  studies and library and information science. As the questionnaire responses highlighted,
                  defining DH or DAH is challenging, as there is no clear consensus around how to
                  understand either (Kilroy-Ewbank 2018). <a class="noteRef" href="#d4e282">[11]</a> Complicating matters further is that digital
                  (or digitized) visual materials, image repositories, and databases are often not
                  considered synonymous with DAH. Several scholars have articulated the difference between
                  digitized art history and DAH (e.g., Drucker 2013; Rodríguez-Ortega 2013a, 2019; Bishop
                  2015; see also Zorich 2012; Baca and Helmreich 2013; Fletcher 2015; and Drucker,
                  Helmreich, Lincoln, and Rose 2017). For them, creating and using digital repositories
                  that “simply aggregate data and/or images” are examples of digitized art history
                  (Rodríguez-Ortega 2013a, 130), whereas research that uses computational analysis (e.g.,
                  GIS mapping, data visualization, topic modeling, network analysis, data mining) is
                  an
                  example of DAH. I am reticent to separate digitized art history entirely from digital
                  art history, however. The digitization of materials and their manipulation — cropping,
                  whitening, framing, straightening, and deciding what to include or exclude — affect
                  how
                  we understand what we are seeing, advancing certain epistemological arguments, a
                  position Barbara Mundy and Dana Leibsohn also address in “Digital Resources: The State
                  of Digital Research on the Visual Culture of Spanish America” (2017), which provides
                  a
                  state of the field as well as describes potential issues with accessibility,
                  collaboration, and the effects of the digital on ways of seeing (see also
                  Rodríguez-Ortega 2018, 2019).

                  is
                  similar to existing modes of writing or teaching; for instance, asking students to
                  reflect on an artwork in a blog post. Digital centeredness suggests foregrounding
                  digital technologies to generate new types of questions, methods, or ideas that more
                  traditional ones cannot or have not; for instance, creating 3D models (Hoobler et
                  al.
                  2018), crowdsourcing to match print sources with colonial paintings (PESSCA 2005–2018),

                  constitutes colonial Latin American visual culture, even if what DAH is remains
                  amorphous. The increase, especially in the past decade, of projects revolving around
                  colonial Latin American art supports this claim that DAH is beneficial (see also Mundy
                  and Leibsohn 2017). These projects offer specialists and students alike the ability
                  to
                  learn about Latin American visual culture and its history in multimodal ways (such
                  as
                  with photographs, video, 3D reconstructions, 360-degree panoramas, text, music, and
                  data
                  visualizations), and even exposure to less canonical (e.g., Vistas), partial, or
                  destroyed objects (e.g., Digital Aponte), architecture, and primary sources related

                  individuals who might develop interest in it as a result of searching the Web. Projects
                  like Vistas, Digital Códice Mendoza (Codex Mendoza Team 2014), Project on Engraved

                  2018) also suggest the myriad ways that DAH projects can engage various types of
                  audiences. The Digital Códice Mendoza, for instance, is bilingual (Spanish and English)
                  and allows users to zoom in and pan across high-resolution scans of the entire codex
                  and

                  For example, one noted the importance of nimble online projects like Smarthistory

                  It is

                  can be added continuously and information updated regularly, helping to dispel the

                  incorporating digital art history practices into undergraduate classes about colonial
                  Latin American visual culture has encouraged better digital critical thinking by
                  encouraging students to think about art history’s ontological issues and nomenclature,
                  descriptive metadata, and issues of colonialism (or neocolonialism), as well as the
                  ways
                  in which digital images have the potential to reframe how we understand the visual

               <div class="ptext" id="p22">Art history has long been about classifying art based on style and iconography. One
                  could argue that for much of its existence, the field has been focused on cataloging
                  works of art and architecture to create, as much as possible, neat taxonomies. If
                  we
                  think back to the origins of the discipline, the art historians who shaped the formation
                  of art history in the late eighteenth, nineteenth, and early twentieth centuries,
                  from
                  Johann Winckelmann, Aby Warburg, and Erwin Panofsky to Alois Riegl, Hienrich Wöfflin,
                  and George Kubler, created classification systems and vocabularies still used today
                  to
                  discuss form and subject matter. They are systems largely centered around and stemming
                  from European art.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e313">[14]</a> In
                  particular there has been a privileging of Italian Renaissance art and the stylistic
                  terms used to describe art from the Italian Peninsula between 1400 and 1600, what
                  Svetlana Alpers (1979) and others refer to as Italocentrism. Many of these stylistic
                  labels, such as Renaissance or Baroque, have also become temporal descriptors, denoting
                  a time period (e.g., Maravall 1986) and sometimes a place, rather than a
                  representational mode.

                  to
                  the visual culture of areas outside of Europe, including those areas, such as Latin
                  America, in which Europeans invaded and colonized people and introduced new visual
                  systems. Colonial Latin American art calls into question where we have centered the
                  canon, the terminology we use to discuss art, and even the spaces and places where
                  art
                  is found. Periodizations describing European artistic trends do not transplant neatly
                  (nor should they) to the Americas, creating what Ananda Cohen-Aponte (2017, 69) notes
                  is
                  one of many “unresolved issues” facing scholars who study colonial Latin American
                  visual
                  culture. Cohen-Aponte points to the “innocuous terminology” (69) applied to viceregal
                  art, seeking to problematize it in an attempt to decolonize art history. Jeanette
                  Peterson has similarly discussed how a term such as Renaissance “advances or impedes
                  our
                  ability to analyze and understand visual culture from the viceregal period” (2008,
                  322).
                  She asks, for instance, how do we categorize an “early seventeenth-century ivory figure
                  of the Mexican Virgin of Guadalupe made by Chinese carvers working in the Philippines,
                  transported across the Pacific in the Manila galleon fleet bound for Acapulco and
                  ultimately destined for American and European consumers?” (2008, 331–332). Do we simply
                  note it as Renaissance or the more generic sixteenth century? Despite the challenges
                  with applying these terms to colonial Latin American visual culture, it has proven
                  difficult to omit them entirely, even in instances when they do not fit comfortably
                  (e.g., Sullivan 1996; Peterson 2008, 322).

                  translate this object, one which resists easy classification, into tidy, “objective”
                  metadata? After all, many DAH projects necessitate the creation of metadata about
                  images. While not speaking specifically to the potential challenges and issues of
                  inputting descriptive metadata in a digital environment, much of Peterson’s discussion,

                  how

                  an archive or catalogue for retrieving information. It enables us to locate, evaluate,
                  and use specific types of visual images (including video). Omeka uses Dublin Core
                  elements to create metadata, and these elements include title, subject, description,
                  creator, source, publisher, date, format, type, identifier, and coverage (Omeka Team
                  2018b).<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e332">[16]</a> Most of the information in these fields are
                  what some might call “indisputable information,” or objective information akin to
                  what
                  we expect to find in a caption or exam slide identifications. For example, the metadata

               <div class="ptext" id="p38">Beyond these metadata fields, users can also create tags to help identify and locate
                  items. For Arellano’s painting, these might include ‘painting’, ‘sacred’, ‘Marian
                  imagery’, ‘seventeenth century’, and so forth.

               <div class="ptext" id="p39">Deciding what to write in each field can be complicated, and tougher still when it
                  becomes clear that this information that seems objective is actually a fiction of
                  objectivity. Many metadata descriptions are subjective. As several scholars remark,
                  “‘objectivity’ is defined by consensus, not by authority. Metadata needs to be a part
                  of
                  that consensus-building process” (Nilsson, Naeve, and Palmér 2004, 248). For example,
                  when entering tags about an item into the Dublin Core, what someone decides to include
                  or exclude impacts how this item is discovered and engaged with in a digital
                  environment. This is also the case when asked to summarize the content of the item
                  in
                  the description. Arellano’s <span class="hi italic">Virgin of Guadalupe </span>could be
                  described in any number of ways. This is not solely an issue about quality control,
                  but
                  also whose voice (or voices) gets to be heard.

               <div class="ptext" id="p40">Descriptive metadata is thus a crucial component for how we access and even analyze
                  visual artifacts. Yet descriptive metadata is indexed with words that must be input
                  by
                  people who bring their own interpretative lens to the process. Murtha Baca describes
                  the
                  inherent challenges to this process, and the problems it can pose for creating
                  “objective” metadata. In her words, “Anyone familiar with art information knows that
                  often the subject matter or theme of a work of art is not reflected at all in its
                  title.
                  . . . I can only find them [images] if the descriptive terms . . . have been applied
                  to
                  them by a human being who has looked at an image, interpreted the file, the visual
                  information, and other available data, and made the decision to apply these data values
                  to it” (2002, 34). But herein lies one of several challenges: What does this descriptive
                  data look like? What terminology do we include or omit? Who decides what is important
                  data to be indexed? In a specialization like colonial Latin American art history,
                  a
                  field filled with scholars actively critiquing the problematic terminology used to
                  classify and analyze visual culture, how do we generate objective, consistent
                  descriptive metadata?

               <div class="counter"><a href="#p41">41</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p41">This question is repeatedly posed in my classes focused on the visual culture of the
                  Spanish Americas. Early on in the courses, I ask students to create metadata (using
                  the
                  Dublin Core fields) for the open chapel murals of the convento of San Nicolás, Actopan,
                  in Hidalgo, Mexico. This low-stakes activity, completed on paper in teams, helps them
                  learn about Dublin Core elements before they actually complete their main course project
                  on Omeka. They need to fill in the fields for title, subject, description, creator,
                  source, date, format, identifier, and coverage.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e395">[18]</a> The results reveal to students the challenges
                  with standardizing metadata and with using art historical terminology developed to
                  describe European art primarily. For instance, for the title, most students write
                  overly
                  generalized descriptive titles (e.g., “Murals,” “Open Chapel,” or “Murals with Christian
                  Subject Matter”). Each field presents its own challenge to students, but it is the
                  topic
                  of what to write for the creator that stimulates the greatest (and most passionate)
                  debate.

               <div class="ptext" id="p42">Almost every student struggles with what to write in the creator field, with descriptors
                  ranging from “Anonymous artist” and “People” to “Indigenous artist(s)” and “Subjugated
                  Artist.” Students read Carolyn Dean and Dana Leibsohn’s “Hybridity and Its Discontents”
                  (2003), which generally sparks a heated discussion about how we talk about who produced
                  colonial Latin American art and how we describe it. Students have not come to a
                  consensus about what word or phrase is best to use, and by the end of class some
                  students are visibly frustrated, confused, or even angry. One student noted in a written
                  reflection that she felt “lied to” about the superficial objectivity of information
                  in
                  image captions, or in this case, with metadata found online.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e401">[19]</a> She elaborated
                  further that the way metadata is presented gives us the impression that it is objective,
                  suggesting it is indisputable, but now she realized that the personal biases we have
                  inform the production of metadata.

               <div class="ptext" id="p43">In the following period, I ask students to create tags of the same image, and they
                  have
                  ranged from ‘Last Judgment’, ‘polychromy’, and ‘mendicant art’ to ‘bright’, ‘damaged’,
                  and ‘early modern’. This generates another reflective moment in the class about the
                  usefulness of tagging, but also the limitations and potential problems of indexing
                  images more generally. The discussion eventually turns to the possibility of social
                  tagging, a common practice on social media sites like Tumblr and Flickr (and even
                  among
                  museum sites like the Brooklyn Museum). Many students have noted that social tagging
                  might circumvent some of the problems associated with the controlled vocabulary used
                  commonly for metadata (like the Library of Congress [LoC] subject headings). With
                  social
                  tagging, more voices could be represented, and in different languages, providing more
                  opportunities to find images like the Actopan open chapel. The general idea of social
                  tagging certainly can aid in overcoming some of the limitations of controlled
                  vocabularies or the “trickiness” of metadata fields, even if it creates its own
                  challenges, such as too many tags, incorrect tags (e.g., misspelled words), or
                  inaccurate tags (see Chai, Zhang, and Jin 2007; Ménard 2009).<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e407">[20]</a> This user-generated tagging has been dubbed as “folksonomy,” or language
                  created by “the masses” which in this case constitutes user-generated tags (Peters
                  2009,
                  1–7). Despite the potential limitations of social tagging, many museums have adopted
                  the
                  practice as a way to further democratize museums and make museums more user-friendly
                  (Alioto 2017). The Brooklyn Museum’s <span class="hi italic">enconchado biombo</span> with the
                  Siege of Belgrade and Hunting Scene, for example, currently has forty-four
                  user-generated tags that range from the general (e.g., ‘screen’) to the specific
                  (‘oars’).<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e413">[21]</a> By
                  engaging in practices and discussions about metadata and tagging, students develop
                  an
                  awareness for the ways in which a single word alters meaning, and in some cases
                  completely reframes how we understand an object or space, such as the Actopan open
                  chapel, or allows users to locate information on the Web.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e419">[22]</a>

                  historical nomenclature, but also reveals some of the limitations of DAH in the process.
                  As one student in this class stated, “if we can’t agree [on] what to write in most
                  of
                  these [Dublin Core] elements, then how will that affect how people locate our
                  materials?” Another noted that she felt she would have an easier time with “inputting
                  an
                  image of Michelangelo’s Sistine Chapel but it is really hard to create clear information
                  about some [colonial] Mexican art.” Yet another student’s response is telling of how
                  important these thorny questions and considerations are: “[E]ven if we can’t agree
                  on
                  what to write [for the metadata], we still need to move forward. . . . Otherwise,
                  people
                  might not even know it exists if they don’t go to college or read books.” I believe
                  what
                  this student was hinting at is the same idea posed by Mark Turin in his essay on “The
                  Devil in the Digital”: the notion that much of what many people learn today is “mediated
                  through the digital. If something [is] not discoverable through an online search or
                  a
                  digital catalogue, it could appear to not exist at all” (2015, 125.) These students
                  have
                  determined some of the challenges of DAH. Many DAH projects rely on metadata, and
                  metadata is created by people, with all of their biases and irrationalities. They
                  had
                  honed in on the very humanness of the digital humanities.

                  colonialism? This is a question raised on several occasions in my classes. Metadata
                  produces knowledge in the online environment, shaping how people relate to and
                  understand Latin American visual culture. If the information that we create perpetuates
                  colonialist discourse, overlooks the diversity of voices that lay claim to this cultural
                  heritage, or simplifies the information so as to become anachronistic, then there
                  is the
                  risk of participating in acts of neocolonialism. In this complex digital world in
                  which
                  we live then, how do we responsibly create digital content without engaging in digital
                  or technological colonialism? What ethical considerations are involved in the production
                  of knowledge in the digital environment? And what does this look like for those of
                  us

               <div class="ptext" id="p47"> When I first developed this project, and as students continued to work on learning
                  about Omeka and the Dublin Core elements for their course project, students decided
                  that
                  it would be useful if everyone in the team relied on the LoC Subject Headings (LCSH)
                  and
                  Classification for specific elements, such as creator. The LCSH are frequently used,
                  not
                  only in the U.S. but also internationally, and are considered a more traditional
                  classification system. I initially agreed with the students’ decision to proceed
                  accordingly. However, as became clear to myself and students, even a quick scan of
                  the
                  LCSH reveals that they can unknowingly perpetuate colonialist, biased, and racist
                  discourse. For instance, to familiarize students with the LCSH, I asked students to
                  look
                  at how monographs about Spanish colonial art incorporated them in the front
                  matter.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e441">[23]</a> An
                  examination of five recent monographs dedicated to the visual culture of post-conquest
                  sixteenth-century Mexico included the LCSH “Indians of Mexico,” often with further
                  subject headings attached such as “Indians of Mexico — ethnic identity,” “Indian art,”
                  or “Indians of Mexico — Missions — History — 16th century.” The terms Indigenous or
                  First Nation do not appear, and often the specific ethnic group or groups are omitted
                  from LCSH unless the monograph is specific to one of them (and if the term exists
                  at
                  all). The use of terminology like ‘Indian art’ is thus vague and reductionistic, but
                  also reifies the colonialist discourse that so many postcolonial and decolonial thinkers
                  have attempted to alter.

                  Indigenous peoples and contexts through our descriptive metadata practices” (Farnel,
                  Laroque, Bigelow et al. 2017). As they describe, “appropriate subject access and
                  descriptive practices are a social justice issue and a moral imperative.” They provide
                  examples of the transformations they have made to subject headings used in metadata,
                  such as switching “Abused Indian children,” the LCSH, to “Abused Indigenous children.”
                  In class, students have seemed excited about the possibility of such a project,
                  especially the notion of descriptive metadata practices as they relate to social justice
                  issues, and how this might alter how publics access and understand information they
                  encounter on the Web. One student commented that she “never had thought about these
                  things before, like how racist or gendered metadata could be. I’d really never thought
                  about metadata at all.” She reflected that the components of the Omeka project had
                  even
                  caused her to rethink what she sees on her personal social media accounts (like
                  Instagram and Facebook) and YouTube.

               <div class="ptext" id="p49">The process of creating this course project raises the question of how we can be mindful
                  of not replicating colonialism in new ways. As discussed above, the process of metadata
                  creation seems simple enough on the surface, but in reality is a more complex venture.
                  As Roopika Risam advises, we must be wary of the violence that occurs in “discursive
                  forms,” such as “reproducing colonial influences in the production of digital knowledge
                  and centering epistemologies and ontologies of the Global North . . . which in turn
                  decenters those of Indigenous communities and the Global South” (2018, 2). For those
                  of
                  us who practice art history, we must be cognizant of how metadata — and digital tools
                  and projects beyond this — has the ability to act as a neocolonial dynamic, and one
                  that
                  situates the Global North as “the site of knowledge production.”<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e456">[25]</a>

                  and
                  how we teach and research. High-resolution images are essential for teaching and
                  research, and more than half of the survey’s respondents mentioned the need for their
                  greater availability. Among the many reasons increased accessibility is needed,
                  respondents listed the high cost of travel and the many international collections
                  that
                  now possess colonial Latin American objects, as well as the lack of high-res images
                  in
                  repositories like ArtStor or Bridgeman Images. For the latter, there is also a fee
                  to
                  acquire them. Moreover, as the academy continues to rely on adjunct labor with absurdly
                  low pay, the need for free, open access to materials was noted as imperative. One
                  response indicated that with greater access to objects and places that are less well
                  known (if at all) the conversations around colonial Latin American art could also
                  noticeably shift.

                  are
                  largely inaccessible without access to a university library. As one respondent noted,
                  DAH projects about Latin American visual culture challenge how and where knowledge
                  is
                  stored; rather than solely in academic journals or printed books, DAH projects have
                  the
                  potential to remove burdensome financial costs, to provide free access to anyone
                  untethered to a university system, and to allow for more collaboration across
                  international borders.

                  researching and teaching about Latin American visual culture, respondents also noted
                  that digitization initiatives and DAH projects have important limitations. One
                  respondent worried about the implications of a project’s obsolescence. Several commented
                  on the issue of collections (visual or archival) that do not have the funds or equipment
                  to digitize their materials, or individuals who do not receive funding to produce
                  and
                  maintain a project online. Their concern is that research agendas and general trends
                  in
                  the field could therefore be determined on what is and is not available digitally.
                  Mundy
                  and Leibsohn (2017) agree that a canon of Latin American visual culture has formed
                  around what has been made more available in the digital domain. This is also true
                  for
                  printed texts, such as those digitized for Google Books. Any library that has not
                  provided access to Google Inc. will have considerably less traffic, which affects
                  current and future research. This could then profoundly alter the production of
                  knowledge about Latin American colonial history and art, as well as the cultural
                  heritage of the many peoples and countries who have a connection to it. In my viceregal
                  art class, this was certainly the case. Students tended to rely primarily on sources
                  that could be found online, such as e-books through the university’s library portal,
                  Google Books, the Getty Research Portal, or the John Carter Brown Library.

               <div class="ptext" id="p54">Open access to knowledge and to visual materials are important, and the immediacy
                  they
                  afford us has the potential to upset problematic aspects facing the academy (such
                  as
                  budget cuts, less time to travel, and the increase in adjunct labor) and the destruction
                  or loss of cultural heritage. But who gets to grant this access? And should all
                  knowledge and imagery be made more accessible? Risam (2018) and Afanador Llach (2019)
                  rightly remind us that the notion that information is and should be free is an
                  assumption of the Global North, one that does not necessarily accord with Indigenous
                  communities of the Global South. Even universal access to the Web is, as
                  Rodríguez-Ortega states, a myth (2013a, 131; see also 2018). A huge portion of the
                  world’s population is still without access to the internet, and it is worth reflecting
                  how the digital practices we engage in could potentially further this digital divide.

               <div class="ptext" id="p55">The issue of access is also one of language. English is the lingua franca of the Web,
                  which can be another barrier for anyone who does not know or use English (Afanador
                  Llach
                  2019; Rodríguez-Ortega 2013a, 131). It can deepen the digital divide. Many DAH projects
                  centered around colonial Latin American art are in English, though there are also
                  examples of bilingual projects (e.g., Digital Códice Mendoza) that offer excellent
                  models for moving forward. As students in my class have wondered, what attempts have
                  been made or can be made to sidestep the perpetual dominance of the Global North as
                  gatekeepers to knowledge? Collaboration, as noted in the questionnaire responses and
                  among students, seems to offer an appealing solution to how we can ensure greater
                  accessibility and perspectives.

                  the
                  team designing a theme and an introductory statement that frames each individual’s

                  team
                  members. As noted above in the metadata discussion, there are steps that students
                  must
                  learn before they create these online exhibitions. They need to understand how to
                  create
                  metadata, as well as to determine how to source images in the public domain or take
                  their own photographs, upload images as items, create and arrange pages, and write
                  for
                  diverse publics (Kilroy-Ewbank 2017a, 2017b, 2018). It requires scaffolding of smaller
                  assignments from the semester’s beginning.

               <div class="ptext" id="p58"> After our discussion about metadata and how to create it, another assignment asks
                  teams
                  to decide on their exhibition’s theme after visiting a local museum collection of
                  Spanish colonial art, such as LACMA’s. Students are asked to photograph their chosen
                  objects that will form the core of their individual component. Before they observe
                  objects on display at the museum, I initiate a conversation about what these photographs
                  could or should look like, how many they might take, and whether the photos might
                  need
                  to be “corrected” or manipulated in some capacity. This conversation usually begins
                  with
                  quizzical looks. As one student later reflected, “I’ve never been asked before [in
                  an
                  art history class] to consider how I take photos or what I might need to do to make
                  them
                  look beautiful.” This discussion inevitably returns us to the importance of how we
                  frame
                  or reframe art, how digital images shift the production of knowledge and our
                  understanding of colonial Latin American art, and how the choices we make to show
                  or not
                  to show specific aspects of an object or building can alter how someone understands
                  it.
                  We watch a Smarthistory video to discuss how the visual choices made in it might affect
                  how we understand a specific work of art and how the visuals create an argument. <a class="noteRef" href="#d4e490">[27]</a> On occasion, it has also raised
                  thought-provoking discussions about labor, both visible and invisible, that broached
                  larger issues involved in digitized and DAH, namely how we assign credit for the work
                  being done.

               <div class="ptext" id="p59"> To provide a brief example, one team framed their exhibition around sacred imagery.
                  One
                  student chose Arellano’s <cite class="title italic">Virgin of Guadalupe</cite> to probe
                  localized sacred imagery specifically. At LACMA, he brought his expensive camera and
                  took dozens of photographs in the manner of Smarthistory’s Steven Zucker, the student’s
                  cited model (Zucker 2018). He not only took photographs of the entire painting but
                  numerous details, as well as photographs of the painting from the side and in relation
                  to objects displayed near it, from far away within the gallery space, with visitors
                  in
                  front of the painting, and in black-and-white. The student either already knew or
                  learned how to use image manipulation software like Adobe Photoshop because his
                  resulting images also included callouts, highlights, color correction, complicated
                  cropping, and straightening.

                  and
                  anxiety by his fellow teammates. They were concerned that his images were of such
                  high
                  quality so as to make their own individual essays look less legitimate or less serious.
                  Most students took photos on their smartphones and had not manipulated them; they
                  were
                  blurry, dark, and crooked, and some had not captured portions of the object itself.
                  The
                  team member with high-quality photographs offered to share his expertise but wondered
                  if
                  the time he spent helping his teammates to improve their resulting digital images
                  would
                  negatively impact his own project because he would have less time to focus on it.

               <div class="ptext" id="p61">In the end, the process prompted an unexpected but important conversation about how
                  digitized images affect our perceptions of digital projects and about the labor involved
                  in creating them. I was reminded of Daniela Bleichmar’s discussion of colonial Latin
                  American art and visual epistemology, or “the role of visuality as a way of knowing,
                  and
                  the process of observation, collecting, representation, and circulation that were
                  integral to the production of knowledge” (2015, 240). Pairing Bleichmar’s essay with
                  the
                  work they were doing in class proved especially generative, with students finding
                  compelling parallels between processes and projects of the past with those in their
                  digital present. Importantly, it also encouraged students to revisit online projects
                  that we had discussed in class to think critically about how the material is presented
                  and how this creates a digital and visual argument. It also stimulated a great deal
                  of
                  dialogue about the need for more accessible high-resolution images of colonial Latin
                  American visual culture, a point that the questionnaire’s respondents repeatedly
                  emphasized.

               <div class="counter"><a href="#p62">62</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p62">Another important point the above example illuminates is the labor involved in
                  digitization, whether of books or images, or in digital work, such as working
                  collaboratively. A great deal of labor goes uncited, unnoticed, as has been addressed
                  more recently by many working in the Digital Humanities (e.g. Keralis 2016; Graban,
                  Marty, Romano, and Vandergrift 2019). In her written reflection, a student pointed
                  out
                  that the invisibility of this labor calls to mind the invisibility of labor used to
                  create the art and architecture of the sixteenth-century Spanish Americas. Even when
                  the
                  creator of digital content is known, such as the photographer who took certain photos
                  and made them available on Flickr Commons, there is a great deal of labor that might
                  go
                  unaccounted for. Image manipulation can be time consuming, and to get it “just right”
                  varies depending on the creator. Individuals responsible for digitizing materials
                  in
                  museums, archives, or libraries, whether for an institution’s website (such as the
                  Metropolitan Museum of Art or Mexico’s Archivo General de la Nación) or a large
                  corporate entity (such as Google Books) are almost never named. Crowdsourcing, for
                  projects like PESSCA or the recent ALAA digital art history resources page, is not
                  free
                  or visible labor, as a recent blog post on the Getty Iris also mentions (Deines et
                  al.
                  2018). <a class="noteRef" href="#d4e524">[28]</a> The
                  concern of my student, who offered to share his photoshopping expertise, about his

                  <div class="ptext" id="p63">“Creating metadata and making an [Omeka] exhibit were totally new experiences for
                     me.
                     . . . Both processes made the art [of the Spanish Americas] far more accessible to
                     me
                     and help[ed] me develop better critical thinking skills about what I see online. .
                     .
                     . They also made me feel uncomfortable because I think my generation just assumes
                     all
                     stuff online is true, even when teachers tell us it isn’t. But now I kinda get it.”
                     This statement, in a student’s final reflection, sums up much of what I have been
                     discussing here and the relationship between the digital, colonial Latin American
                     art, and pedagogy. As is clear from this class project, digital art history can
                     disturb and disrupt how students approach colonial Latin American art. As I hope this
                     essay demonstrates, while the digital turn offers many positive ways in which we can
                     rethink and reframe art history and specifically the visual culture of colonial Latin
                     America, it seems mindful to be wary of the notion that it can create a false
                     perception of a techno-utopia in which all creators and users are equal, and
                     information is always readily accessible and objective.

                     respondents use museum websites to source images and access digitized archival
