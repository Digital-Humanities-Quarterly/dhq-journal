            <p>This essay explores the challenges of using <q>the digital,</q> both scholarly and
               pedagogically, for understanding and analyzing colonial Latin American art. It argues
               that digital art history (DAH) tools and methods offer new ways to think about the
               non-neutrality of how we access, collect, and understand information discovered
               online. Specifically, it focuses on responses to questionnaire and the development of
               a collaborative Omeka project (involving students) to consider how knowledge is
               produced in the digital environment. It reflects on issues of digital and visual
               epistemology, digital visuality, the ontology of art history, accessibility, and
               neocolonialism, and how these topics have been broached with undergraduate students
               in a class focused on Spanish colonial art.</p>

         <p>Este ensayo explora los desafíos de usar <q>lo digital,</q> tanto académica como
            pedagógicamente, para comprender y analizar el arte colonial latinoamericano. Sostiene
            que las herramientas y los métodos de la historia del arte digital (DAH) ofrecen nuevas
            formas de pensar sobre la no neutralidad de cómo accedemos, recopilamos, y entendemos la
            información descubierta en línea. Específicamente, se centra en las respuestas al
            cuestionario y en el desarrollo de un proyecto colaborativo Omeka (con estudiantes) para
            considerar cómo se produce el conocimiento en el entorno digital. Reflexiona sobre temas
            de epistemología digital y visual, visualidad digital, ontología de la historia del
            arte, accesibilidad y neocolonialismo, y cómo estos temas han sido abordados con
            estudiantes en una clase enfocada en el arte colonial.</p>

         <p>“[D]igital media is not neutral: It impacts the represented information and the ways
            society interprets it” (Kalay 2008, 1).</p>
         <p>Introduction: Colonial Latin American Art and The Digital</p>
         <p>Digital visual media, such as images and videos, form an inescapable cornerstone of our
            lived experience. For those of us in higher education, the digital is altering not only
            how and what we research but also how and what we teach. In a similar vein as other
            specializations, the study of colonial Latin American art is being transformed. Art
            historians, finely attuned to the visual world and the meaning-making processes
            informing it, seem uniquely positioned to engage with and critique the digital realm
            that we increasingly inhabit and to teach digital, visual literacy.<note>I alternate
               between the terms <q>art</q> and <q>visual culture</q> with full understanding that
               there are important differences between them. For the sake of space, I do not unpack
               the manifold meanings of either term.</note></p>
         <p> Despite art historians’ possible role to play in shaping and framing the digital world,
            there is still an ambivalence about what the digital turn has to offer art history. An
            assessment of the impact of <q>the digital,</q> and more specifically the digital
            humanities (DH) and digital art history (DAH), on the field of art history reveals that
            there are those who believe the digital turn has the potential to positively disrupt it
            (e.g., Honig 2018) and those who feel it has the potential to problematically disturb it
            (e.g., Bishop 2015). Regardless of where an individual’s position falls on this
            spectrum, the digital is here to stay, and it is reinventing art history and the manner
            in which we access, engage with, asses, and frame visual culture. One wonders, as Nuria
            Rodríguez-Ortega (2013b) has, if Donald Preziosi (1991) could have imagined the impact
            the digital would have on how we “rethink art history,” a suggestion he first made about
            the art-historical discipline in the wake of post-structuralist and post-modern
            critiques of art and the (im)possibility of stable meaning.</p>
         <p>For all these reasons, it is important that we equip ourselves with the ability to
            understand how the digital frames or reframes our understanding of visual culture and to
            effectively critique it. As art historians know all too well, framing devices construct
            a visual rhetoric, one that creates certain “epistemological and methodological
            assumptions,” in the words of Elli Doulkaridou (2015, 69). Something as seemingly simple
            as substituting, in class, a high-resolution gigapixel panoramic 360° photo of the
            church of San Pablo de Ocongate in Peru (MAVCOR 2018) for a flat megapixel one can alter
            perception, experience, and belief about the object or space that the digital image
            indexes. The digital turn has thus prompted shifts in how we see the world and the ways
            in which we consume and produce knowledge. In the digital environment in which we
            increasingly live, learn, and, for those of us in the classroom, teach, it has become
            clear that we must consider digital technology as epistemology (Schilling 2014;
            Rodríguez-Ortega 2010). Digital media is, as Yehuda Kalay states, not neutral, but
            creates, shapes, and disseminates knowledge in different ways than a hardbound book, a
            DVD, or a lecture delivered in a classroom. Similarly, Rodríguez-Ortega advises us to be
            mindful about how we perceive of the digital realm — not as a “neutral, innocuous space
            that delivers information” but as a “cultural, political, and ideological venue” (2013a,
               132).<note>See also Rodríguez-Ortega 2018.</note>
         </p>
         <p>For these reasons it is imperative to think about not only the technological tools
            needed to engage in digital practices and meaning-making, but also the critical tools
            needed to think about what content to produce and how to produce it. I would add to this
            that we also need the critical tools to think about, assess, and communicate what and
            how we experience and interact with (i.e. what we consume) online. Even those of us who
            do not intend to make DAH tools or projects will encounter and use them, and most if not
            all art historians now employ digitized images for our teaching and research. The very
            way these digitized images are aggregated and framed has the potential to shift our
            field — ontologically, epistemologically, and pedagogically.</p>
         <p>This essay grapples with some of the complexities that the digital poses for those of us
            who teach and research colonial Latin American art. It asks a number of questions: In
            what ways can DAH methods and tools, as well as digitized visual materials, help us to
            think more critically or differently about visual culture? What challenges exist when
            working with digital images, tools, and methods?<note> Conversations with Beth Harris
               and Steven Zucker, the founders of Smarthistory.org, have been influential on my own
               thinking about digital art history pedagogy. See also Harris and Zucker 2015.</note>
            To explore these questions, I draw on responses to a questionnaire and my own
            pedagogical experiences. The questionnaire gathered information about how others in the
            field of colonial Latin American art history approach the digital in their pedagogy and
            research. These responses serve as a launching point for a broader discussion of the
            ramifications of DAH pedagogy and research as it relates to the visual culture of
            colonial Latin America.<note> The questionnaire asked general questions about digitized
               and digital art history, teaching, and Omeka, as well as about the open-educational
               resource Smarthistory. Originally, this essay also addressed a case study of using
               the production of Smarthistory videos as a model for collaborative DAH pedagogy and
               practice. However, because of the limitations on length for this essay, the
               discussion of Smarthistory has been omitted, as have the questionnaire responses
               about it. This data will be used for a separate essay to be published
               elsewhere.</note> Also serving as a springboard to wrestling with these issues are my
            own experiences with DAH pedagogy and the challenges it has presented to both me and my
            students when discussing and analyzing colonial Latin American art. In particular, I
            describe a course project that asks students to build digital exhibitions about Spanish
            colonial art using the content management system (CMS) called Omeka (Omeka Team 2018a).
            Discussions about metadata and the use of digital images prompted the students and me to
            consider issues of digital and visual epistemology, digital visuality and storytelling,
            art historical nomenclature, the ontology of art history, digital colonialism and
            neocolonialism, accessibility, and labor — all in the course of a semester. These
            considerations aided students in not only thinking more critically about colonial Latin
            American art, but also developing digital and multimodal literacy with Web 2.0
               technology.<note> For a useful discussion of Web 2.0 and the ontology of the digital,
               see Evens 2012.</note> In focusing on these pedagogical experiences, I hope to
            highlight some of the greater implications of the digital world for the study of
            colonial Latin American visual culture and pay heed to how DAH pedagogy can both disrupt
            and disturb art history.</p>
         <p>&lt;Gathering Data from a Questionnaire&gt;</p>
         <p>To collect information from other scholars teaching and researching the visual culture
            of colonial Latin America, I distributed a questionnaire in English to the Association
            of Latin American Art (ALAA) listserv.<note> In hindsight, the questionnaire should have
               also been written in Spanish and distributed on other listservs. ALAA is a U.S.-based
               association but with an international reach.</note> The survey gathered data
            anonymously with both quantitative and qualitative questions to develop a mixed-methods
               approach.<note> Quantitative questions provided basic information in a yes/no/maybe
               format. Each participant’s qualitative responses were also analyzed using thematic
               analysis (coding of written text into themes).</note> It asked a series of questions
            about how people teach or research colonial Latin American art using DAH tools or
            resources, and whether they use DAH projects like Smarthistory or tools like Omeka, and
            if so, how. It compiled information about how long a participant has taught, the
            subjects of courses focused on colonial Latin American visual culture, and the
            orientation of these classes towards DAH or DH. </p>
         <p> Fourteen individuals responded to the survey, offering a small, yet useful <hi
               rend="italic">n</hi> to analyze the role of the digital in teaching and researching
            about colonial Latin American visual culture.<note> Most participants have been teaching
               for at least six years (more than 60%), and 38.5% for more than ten. The types of
               classes people teach vary from undergraduate surveys on colonial Latin American art
               and architecture, to smaller classes focused on a region or specific century and
               undergraduate or graduate seminars on a specific theme (such as portraiture in the
               Americas or eighteenth-century Mexican painting).</note> The open-ended answers
            varied from a few words to lengthy paragraphs. Despite this variability, the responses
            prompted thought-provoking reflection on the role of digitized and digital art history
            among those of us focused on the visual culture of colonial Latin America. The collected
            data revealed a number of important concerns, among them (1) the broad way in which
            individuals define, understand, and use “the digital” when researching or teaching about
            colonial Latin American visual culture; (2) the perception that digitized and digital
            art history have the potential to advance the study of Latin American art and to
            complicate or decenter the canon, even if the specific ways in which this might occur
            seem vague and undetermined; (3) the importance of access to high-resolution images,
            archival materials, and scholarship to ease financial burden and collaborate across
            international borders; and (4) the need for more digital resources or projects, despite
            the large number of perceived challenges, which include the limitations of digital
            technologies, the time needed to learn digital tools and skills, and the reliability and
            trustworthiness of these tools and projects. The remainder of this essay explores these
            ideas in connection to pedagogical strategies and experiences with digital art history
            in an undergraduate class focused on colonial Latin American visual culture.</p>
         <p>&lt;Using and Defining Digitized and Digital Art History&gt;</p>
         <p>The general consensus from the responses on the questionnaire is that working with
            digital tools and digitized visual materials offers clear benefits to any scholar or
            student of art history, regardless of their specialization.<note> When asked if DAH
               tools and methods offer new approaches to teaching or researching the art of colonial
               Latin America, almost all respondents answered yes (76.9%). 23.1% answered
               maybe.</note> These benefits include access to materials from around the globe, the
            use of high-resolution images for study, the opportunity to create a visual archive of
            images currently split among international collections, or the invitation to engage with
            materials more slowly from anywhere at any time. The qualitative responses detailed the
            various ways respondents felt that DAH had impacted (or could impact) their research,
            teaching, the field of colonial Latin American art, and art history more generally. Many
            suggested that DAH provides new ways of interacting with data, helps us to ask new types
            of questions, and shifts how we understand visual culture. However, most respondents
            mentioned that they were unsure what these interactions or shifts might look like and
            whether they were sustainable. When asked if they themselves are active in DAH or DH,
            42.9% responded yes, 35.7% maybe, and 21.4% no. Written responses suggested that some
            participants were simply unsure if what they were doing “counted” as DAH; for example,
            several wondered if using a university’s CMS in their colonial Latin American art
            classes meant they had familiarity with or practiced DAH. Others noted their reticence
            to answer ‘yes’ because they were unsure how to define DAH altogether, noting that they
            could not align themselves with it if they do not know what it is, and if art historians
            more generally cannot agree how to define it.</p>
         <p>Respondents relied on a wide range of digital tools and methods for their research, but
            this use was more limited pedagogically.<note> Responses describing the impact of the
               digital on research were the most varied and detailed, indicating the numerous ways
               in which information is searched, retrieved, collected, and analyzed. Most commonly,
               respondents use museum websites to source images and access digitized archival
               materials. Beyond these, respondents listed the importance of general Google
               searches, and the use of specific Google tools like Scholar and Books, as well as
               Wikipedia, Academia.edu, Zotero, Dropbox, Videoconferencing, spatial and textual
               analysis, spreadsheets, and social media (e.g., Twitter). </note> 69.2% answered that
            their classes are not oriented towards DAH; remaining responses were split between yes
            and maybe. A follow-up question asked participants to describe those classes that
            foregrounded, or at least incorporated to some extent, digital methods and tools.
            Several individuals incorporate textual analysis, mapping, image annotation, or the
            creation and curation of online projects (such as the development of an online
            exhibition using Omeka). Most commonly, though, respondents linked students to digital
            image repositories, essays, and videos from sites like Vistas (Leibsohn and Mundy 2015),
            Smarthistory (2018), and the Metropolitan Museum’s Heilbrunn Timeline (2000–2018). These
            answers further highlighted the confusion (and in some cases frustration) about how to
            define or understand DAH or what constitutes doing it or using it in the classroom
            setting. </p>
         <p>Digital Art History is one aspect of the Digital Humanities, and both have affected the
            development of the humanities more broadly. Those engaged with DAH cross disciplinary
            boundaries, incorporating not only art history and computer science, but also media
            studies and library and information science. As the questionnaire responses highlighted,
            defining DH or DAH is challenging, as there is no clear consensus around how to
            understand either (Kilroy-Ewbank 2018). <note> I would also argue, as others have before
               me, that soon the ‘digital’ will be dropped from digital art history (Hohensee 2018).
               Rodríguez-Ortega’s essay (2019) also notes that special journal volumes on DAH will
               likely no longer be published.</note> Complicating matters further is that digital
            (or digitized) visual materials, image repositories, and databases are often not
            considered synonymous with DAH. Several scholars have articulated the difference between
            digitized art history and DAH (e.g., Drucker 2013; Rodríguez-Ortega 2013a, 2019; Bishop
            2015; see also Zorich 2012; Baca and Helmreich 2013; Fletcher 2015; and Drucker,
            Helmreich, Lincoln, and Rose 2017). For them, creating and using digital repositories
            that “simply aggregate data and/or images” are examples of digitized art history
            (Rodríguez-Ortega 2013a, 130), whereas research that uses computational analysis (e.g.,
            GIS mapping, data visualization, topic modeling, network analysis, data mining) is an
            example of DAH. I am reticent to separate digitized art history entirely from digital
            art history, however. The digitization of materials and their manipulation — cropping,
            whitening, framing, straightening, and deciding what to include or exclude — affect how
            we understand what we are seeing, advancing certain epistemological arguments, a
            position Barbara Mundy and Dana Leibsohn also address in “Digital Resources: The State
            of Digital Research on the Visual Culture of Spanish America” (2017), which provides a
            state of the field as well as describes potential issues with accessibility,
            collaboration, and the effects of the digital on ways of seeing (see also
            Rodríguez-Ortega 2018, 2019).</p>
         <p>It is more valuable perhaps to distinguish between digital inflection and digital
            centeredness. The former uses certain digital technologies to create something that is
            similar to existing modes of writing or teaching; for instance, asking students to
            reflect on an artwork in a blog post. Digital centeredness suggests foregrounding
            digital technologies to generate new types of questions, methods, or ideas that more
            traditional ones cannot or have not; for instance, creating 3D models (Hoobler et al.
            2018), crowdsourcing to match print sources with colonial paintings (PESSCA 2005–2018),
            or mapping the locations of artworks described in archival documents (Rodriguez et al.
            2018). </p>
         <p>Most questionnaire respondents insinuated that the digital turn offers important
            benefits for pedagogy, research, and the very manner in which we determine what
            constitutes colonial Latin American visual culture, even if what DAH is remains
            amorphous. The increase, especially in the past decade, of projects revolving around
            colonial Latin American art supports this claim that DAH is beneficial (see also Mundy
            and Leibsohn 2017). These projects offer specialists and students alike the ability to
            learn about Latin American visual culture and its history in multimodal ways (such as
            with photographs, video, 3D reconstructions, 360-degree panoramas, text, music, and data
            visualizations), and even exposure to less canonical (e.g., Vistas), partial, or
            destroyed objects (e.g., Digital Aponte), architecture, and primary sources related to
            the visual, material record. </p>
         <p> A few survey responses indicated the importance of reaching out to different publics —
            scholars, students, anyone interested in colonial Latin American art, and those
            individuals who might develop interest in it as a result of searching the Web. Projects
            like Vistas, Digital Códice Mendoza (Codex Mendoza Team 2014), Project on Engraved
            Sources of Spanish Colonial Art (PESSCA 2005–2018), and Digital Aponte (Rodriguez et al.
            2018) also suggest the myriad ways that DAH projects can engage various types of
            audiences. The Digital Códice Mendoza, for instance, is bilingual (Spanish and English)
            and allows users to zoom in and pan across high-resolution scans of the entire codex and
            offers transcriptions of the text as you hover over it. It is of interest to art
            historians, but also historians, paleographers, archaeologists, and so forth, and is
            accessible to anyone with the internet. </p>
         <p>A couple respondents mentioned that DAH has the ability to challenge entrenched ideas
            about the field of art history, and the role of colonial Latin American art within it.
            For example, one noted the importance of nimble online projects like Smarthistory as
            alternatives to textbooks that are not updated regularly. Smarthistory is, for lack of a
            better term, a not-for-profit open educational resource that focuses on world art. It is
            the result of collaboration among more than 400 art historians. New essays and videos
            can be added continuously and information updated regularly, helping to dispel the
            notion that art history — and colonial Latin American art by extension — is fixed.<note>
               A series of recent blog posts on Smarthistory expand on this very idea (Hohensee
               2018). </note>
         </p>
         <p>The idea that digital art history projects can reach wider audiences and disrupt the
            field of colonial Latin American art history is one that warrants greater discussion.
            Here, I would like to offer a few reflections and discussion points about how
            incorporating digital art history practices into undergraduate classes about colonial
            Latin American visual culture has encouraged better digital critical thinking by
            encouraging students to think about art history’s ontological issues and nomenclature,
            descriptive metadata, and issues of colonialism (or neocolonialism), as well as the ways
            in which digital images have the potential to reframe how we understand the visual
            culture of this region and time period.<note> These classes include Spanish Colonial,
               Latin American (1492–present), and Global Renaissance art.</note>
         </p>
         <p>&lt;Art History’s Ontological Issues and Descriptive Metadata &gt;</p>
         <p>Art history has long been about classifying art based on style and iconography. One
            could argue that for much of its existence, the field has been focused on cataloging
            works of art and architecture to create, as much as possible, neat taxonomies. If we
            think back to the origins of the discipline, the art historians who shaped the formation
            of art history in the late eighteenth, nineteenth, and early twentieth centuries, from
            Johann Winckelmann, Aby Warburg, and Erwin Panofsky to Alois Riegl, Hienrich Wöfflin,
            and George Kubler, created classification systems and vocabularies still used today to
            discuss form and subject matter. They are systems largely centered around and stemming
            from European art.<note> Matthew Lincoln has also made this point (2014).</note> In
            particular there has been a privileging of Italian Renaissance art and the stylistic
            terms used to describe art from the Italian Peninsula between 1400 and 1600, what
            Svetlana Alpers (1979) and others refer to as Italocentrism. Many of these stylistic
            labels, such as Renaissance or Baroque, have also become temporal descriptors, denoting
            a time period (e.g., Maravall 1986) and sometimes a place, rather than a
            representational mode. </p>
         <p>The nomenclature of art history developed to describe European art has been appended to
            the visual culture of areas outside of Europe, including those areas, such as Latin
            America, in which Europeans invaded and colonized people and introduced new visual
            systems. Colonial Latin American art calls into question where we have centered the
            canon, the terminology we use to discuss art, and even the spaces and places where art
            is found. Periodizations describing European artistic trends do not transplant neatly
            (nor should they) to the Americas, creating what Ananda Cohen-Aponte (2017, 69) notes is
            one of many “unresolved issues” facing scholars who study colonial Latin American visual
            culture. Cohen-Aponte points to the “innocuous terminology” (69) applied to viceregal
            art, seeking to problematize it in an attempt to decolonize art history. Jeanette
            Peterson has similarly discussed how a term such as Renaissance “advances or impedes our
            ability to analyze and understand visual culture from the viceregal period” (2008, 322).
            She asks, for instance, how do we categorize an “early seventeenth-century ivory figure
            of the Mexican Virgin of Guadalupe made by Chinese carvers working in the Philippines,
            transported across the Pacific in the Manila galleon fleet bound for Acapulco and
            ultimately destined for American and European consumers?” (2008, 331–332). Do we simply
            note it as Renaissance or the more generic sixteenth century? Despite the challenges
            with applying these terms to colonial Latin American visual culture, it has proven
            difficult to omit them entirely, even in instances when they do not fit comfortably
            (e.g., Sullivan 1996; Peterson 2008, 322). </p>
         <p>Where does digital art history fit into these discussions about nomenclature and the
            ontology of art history? If we were to reconceptualize Peterson’s question about the
            ivory figure of Guadalupe from the point of view of DAH, we might ask, how could we
            translate this object, one which resists easy classification, into tidy, “objective”
            metadata? After all, many DAH projects necessitate the creation of metadata about
            images. While not speaking specifically to the potential challenges and issues of
            inputting descriptive metadata in a digital environment, much of Peterson’s discussion,
            as well as Cohen-Aponte’s, revolve around similar issues. </p>
         <p>I would argue that there are DAH processes and ideas that can assist scholars and
            students to think more critically about the terminology used to describe colonial Latin
            American art in the digital environment. If one of the main reasons for engaging with
            the digital is to access information, as the questionnaire responses all noted, then how
            we input, organize, aggregate, and source that data is fundamentally significant. My own
            experiences with introducing students to metadata, as one step towards producing a
            collaborative online exhibition on Omeka, has stimulated important and thought-provoking
            conversations about how we describe, analyze, frame, and discuss colonial Latin American
               art.<note> While most questionnaire respondents used (or at least knew of)
               Smarthistory, few used Omeka in any of their classes. 42.9% use Smarthistory in their
               classes. Only 7.7% employed Omeka. One participant noted that she uses it herself but
               had not yet introduced it to students. The two respondents who did incorporate Omeka
               asked students to create digital exhibitions of artworks.</note> It helped them to
            develop digital literacy and to grasp more fully the non-neutrality of the visual
            resources and DAH projects and the Web more generally. It also increased their awareness
            of how we access information and how the presentation of that information affects what
            we know or think we know, how we see, and where we locate knowledge about colonial Latin
            American visual culture.</p>
         <p>To create their online exhibition with Omeka, students must learn about metadata. In the
            process of creating metadata, students must weigh the eurocentric (and colonial) bias of
            art historical nomenclature and terminology. Metadata is data about data to help create
            an archive or catalogue for retrieving information. It enables us to locate, evaluate,
            and use specific types of visual images (including video). Omeka uses Dublin Core
            elements to create metadata, and these elements include title, subject, description,
            creator, source, publisher, date, format, type, identifier, and coverage (Omeka Team
               2018b).<note> Dublin Core is centered around fifteen “core” elements that were
               created in an attempt to standardize metadata by providing specific standards for
               inputting data across fields. </note> Most of the information in these fields are
            what some might call “indisputable information,” or objective information akin to what
            we expect to find in a caption or exam slide identifications. For example, the metadata
            for a photographic reproduction of Manuel de Arellano’s <hi rend="italic">Virgin of
               Guadalupe</hi>
            <note> For the image, see <ref
                  target="https://collections.lacma.org/node/220044?parent=589011"
                  >https://collections.lacma.org/node/220044?parent=589011</ref>. </note> from 1691
            at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art could read as follows: </p>
         <p>title: Virgin of Guadalupe</p>
         <p>subject: Madonnas (using the Library of Congress Thesaurus for Graphic Materials) or
            perhaps Mary, Blessed Virgin, Saint — Apparitions and miracles (using the LCSH, or
            Library of Congress Subject Headings)</p>
         <p>author: Manuel de Arellano</p>
         <p>description: A painting of the Virgin of Guadalupe, one of the most venerated Marian
            advocations in the world. It replicates the original tilma worn by Juan Diego.</p>
         <p>creator: LACMA</p>
         <p>source: LACMA</p>
         <p>publisher: LACMA</p>
         <p>date: 1691 (or the date of the photograph)</p>
         <p>format: oil on canvas (or the type of digital file)</p>
         <p>identifier: a URL to the LACMA collection page</p>
         <p>coverage: Mexico</p>
         <p>Beyond these metadata fields, users can also create tags to help identify and locate
            items. For Arellano’s painting, these might include ‘painting’, ‘sacred’, ‘Marian
            imagery’, ‘seventeenth century’, and so forth.</p>
         <p>Deciding what to write in each field can be complicated, and tougher still when it
            becomes clear that this information that seems objective is actually a fiction of
            objectivity. Many metadata descriptions are subjective. As several scholars remark,
            “‘objectivity’ is defined by consensus, not by authority. Metadata needs to be a part of
            that consensus-building process” (Nilsson, Naeve, and Palmér 2004, 248). For example,
            when entering tags about an item into the Dublin Core, what someone decides to include
            or exclude impacts how this item is discovered and engaged with in a digital
            environment. This is also the case when asked to summarize the content of the item in
            the description. Arellano’s <hi rend="italic">Virgin of Guadalupe </hi>could be
            described in any number of ways. This is not solely an issue about quality control, but
            also whose voice (or voices) gets to be heard. </p>
         <p>Descriptive metadata is thus a crucial component for how we access and even analyze
            visual artifacts. Yet descriptive metadata is indexed with words that must be input by
            people who bring their own interpretative lens to the process. Murtha Baca describes the
            inherent challenges to this process, and the problems it can pose for creating
            “objective” metadata. In her words, “Anyone familiar with art information knows that
            often the subject matter or theme of a work of art is not reflected at all in its title.
            . . . I can only find them [images] if the descriptive terms . . . have been applied to
            them by a human being who has looked at an image, interpreted the file, the visual
            information, and other available data, and made the decision to apply these data values
            to it” (2002, 34). But herein lies one of several challenges: What does this descriptive
            data look like? What terminology do we include or omit? Who decides what is important
            data to be indexed? In a specialization like colonial Latin American art history, a
            field filled with scholars actively critiquing the problematic terminology used to
            classify and analyze visual culture, how do we generate objective, consistent
            descriptive metadata?</p>
         <p>This question is repeatedly posed in my classes focused on the visual culture of the
            Spanish Americas. Early on in the courses, I ask students to create metadata (using the
            Dublin Core fields) for the open chapel murals of the convento of San Nicolás, Actopan,
            in Hidalgo, Mexico. This low-stakes activity, completed on paper in teams, helps them
            learn about Dublin Core elements before they actually complete their main course project
            on Omeka. They need to fill in the fields for title, subject, description, creator,
            source, date, format, identifier, and coverage.<note> For explanations of each of these
               fields, see Omeka Team 2018b.</note> The results reveal to students the challenges
            with standardizing metadata and with using art historical terminology developed to
            describe European art primarily. For instance, for the title, most students write overly
            generalized descriptive titles (e.g., “Murals,” “Open Chapel,” or “Murals with Christian
            Subject Matter”). Each field presents its own challenge to students, but it is the topic
            of what to write for the creator that stimulates the greatest (and most passionate)
            debate. </p>
         <p>Almost every student struggles with what to write in the creator field, with descriptors
            ranging from “Anonymous artist” and “People” to “Indigenous artist(s)” and “Subjugated
            Artist.” Students read Carolyn Dean and Dana Leibsohn’s “Hybridity and Its Discontents”
            (2003), which generally sparks a heated discussion about how we talk about who produced
            colonial Latin American art and how we describe it. Students have not come to a
            consensus about what word or phrase is best to use, and by the end of class some
            students are visibly frustrated, confused, or even angry. One student noted in a written
            reflection that she felt “lied to” about the superficial objectivity of information in
            image captions, or in this case, with metadata found online.<note> Students were asked
               to write a short, written reflection after each class period.</note> She elaborated
            further that the way metadata is presented gives us the impression that it is objective,
            suggesting it is indisputable, but now she realized that the personal biases we have
            inform the production of metadata. </p>
         <p>In the following period, I ask students to create tags of the same image, and they have
            ranged from ‘Last Judgment’, ‘polychromy’, and ‘mendicant art’ to ‘bright’, ‘damaged’,
            and ‘early modern’. This generates another reflective moment in the class about the
            usefulness of tagging, but also the limitations and potential problems of indexing
            images more generally. The discussion eventually turns to the possibility of social
            tagging, a common practice on social media sites like Tumblr and Flickr (and even among
            museum sites like the Brooklyn Museum). Many students have noted that social tagging
            might circumvent some of the problems associated with the controlled vocabulary used
            commonly for metadata (like the Library of Congress [LoC] subject headings). With social
            tagging, more voices could be represented, and in different languages, providing more
            opportunities to find images like the Actopan open chapel. The general idea of social
            tagging certainly can aid in overcoming some of the limitations of controlled
            vocabularies or the “trickiness” of metadata fields, even if it creates its own
            challenges, such as too many tags, incorrect tags (e.g., misspelled words), or
            inaccurate tags (see Chai, Zhang, and Jin 2007; Ménard 2009).<note> For more on the
               challenges of creating collaborative metadata in the classroom, see Richardson
               2020.</note> This user-generated tagging has been dubbed as “folksonomy,” or language
            created by “the masses” which in this case constitutes user-generated tags (Peters 2009,
            1–7). Despite the potential limitations of social tagging, many museums have adopted the
            practice as a way to further democratize museums and make museums more user-friendly
            (Alioto 2017). The Brooklyn Museum’s <hi rend="italic">enconchado biombo</hi> with the
            Siege of Belgrade and Hunting Scene, for example, currently has forty-four
            user-generated tags that range from the general (e.g., ‘screen’) to the specific
               (‘oars’).<note> To see the image, its metadata, and social tags, visit <ref
                  target="https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/objects/207337"
                  >https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/objects/207337</ref>. </note> By
            engaging in practices and discussions about metadata and tagging, students develop an
            awareness for the ways in which a single word alters meaning, and in some cases
            completely reframes how we understand an object or space, such as the Actopan open
            chapel, or allows users to locate information on the Web.<note> I am reminded of
               Cohen-Aponte’s recent discussion about decolonizing the global renaissance,
               encapsulated by her discussion about terminology. She notes the important
               ramifications of changing just one word, such as if we were to change the sentence
               “viceregal art…as art that just so happened to <hi rend="italic">coincide</hi> with
               colonization” to “art produced <hi rend="italic">under</hi> colonization” (2017,
               74).</note>
         </p>
         <p> This exercise not only prompts reflection and critique about metadata and art
            historical nomenclature, but also reveals some of the limitations of DAH in the process.
            As one student in this class stated, “if we can’t agree [on] what to write in most of
            these [Dublin Core] elements, then how will that affect how people locate our
            materials?” Another noted that she felt she would have an easier time with “inputting an
            image of Michelangelo’s Sistine Chapel but it is really hard to create clear information
            about some [colonial] Mexican art.” Yet another student’s response is telling of how
            important these thorny questions and considerations are: “[E]ven if we can’t agree on
            what to write [for the metadata], we still need to move forward. . . . Otherwise, people
            might not even know it exists if they don’t go to college or read books.” I believe what
            this student was hinting at is the same idea posed by Mark Turin in his essay on “The
            Devil in the Digital”: the notion that much of what many people learn today is “mediated
            through the digital. If something [is] not discoverable through an online search or a
            digital catalogue, it could appear to not exist at all” (2015, 125.) These students have
            determined some of the challenges of DAH. Many DAH projects rely on metadata, and
            metadata is created by people, with all of their biases and irrationalities. They had
            honed in on the very humanness of the digital humanities.</p>
         <p>&lt;Digital Colonialism and the Digital Divide&gt;</p>
         <p>Can the metadata we create about colonial Latin America objects be a form of digital
            colonialism? This is a question raised on several occasions in my classes. Metadata
            produces knowledge in the online environment, shaping how people relate to and
            understand Latin American visual culture. If the information that we create perpetuates
            colonialist discourse, overlooks the diversity of voices that lay claim to this cultural
            heritage, or simplifies the information so as to become anachronistic, then there is the
            risk of participating in acts of neocolonialism. In this complex digital world in which
            we live then, how do we responsibly create digital content without engaging in digital
            or technological colonialism? What ethical considerations are involved in the production
            of knowledge in the digital environment? And what does this look like for those of us
            who teach and research the visual culture of colonial Latin America?</p>
         <p> When I first developed this project, and as students continued to work on learning
            about Omeka and the Dublin Core elements for their course project, students decided that
            it would be useful if everyone in the team relied on the LoC Subject Headings (LCSH) and
            Classification for specific elements, such as creator. The LCSH are frequently used, not
            only in the U.S. but also internationally, and are considered a more traditional
            classification system. I initially agreed with the students’ decision to proceed
            accordingly. However, as became clear to myself and students, even a quick scan of the
            LCSH reveals that they can unknowingly perpetuate colonialist, biased, and racist
            discourse. For instance, to familiarize students with the LCSH, I asked students to look
            at how monographs about Spanish colonial art incorporated them in the front
               matter.<note> The LCSH used are not determined by the authors themselves.</note> An
            examination of five recent monographs dedicated to the visual culture of post-conquest
            sixteenth-century Mexico included the LCSH “Indians of Mexico,” often with further
            subject headings attached such as “Indians of Mexico — ethnic identity,” “Indian art,”
            or “Indians of Mexico — Missions — History — 16th century.” The terms Indigenous or
            First Nation do not appear, and often the specific ethnic group or groups are omitted
            from LCSH unless the monograph is specific to one of them (and if the term exists at
            all). The use of terminology like ‘Indian art’ is thus vague and reductionistic, but
            also reifies the colonialist discourse that so many postcolonial and decolonial thinkers
            have attempted to alter. </p>
         <p>One way in which it is possible to rectify some of these imbalances and problems is to
            do what the University of Alberta’s Decolonizing Description Working Group (DDWG) has
            done, and what other institutions, such as the John Carter Brown Library, are seeking to
               do.<note> In 2017, the JCBL posted a position for a postdoctoral fellow for data
               curation in Latin American and Caribbean Indigenous languages. As stated in the job
               description, “The goal of this project is to assess how digital tools and metadata
               created through collaborative processes across a hemispheric arc can serve scholarly
               and non-scholarly communities now and into the future.” See <ref
                  target="https://www.clir.org/fellowships/postdoc/applicants/john-carter-brown-library-brown-university/"
                  >https://www.clir.org/fellowships/postdoc/applicants/john-carter-brown-library-brown-university/</ref>
            </note> The DDWG note that their aim is “to investigate, define and propose a plan of
            action for how UAL can more accurately, appropriately, and respectfully represent
            Indigenous peoples and contexts through our descriptive metadata practices” (Farnel,
            Laroque, Bigelow et al. 2017). As they describe, “appropriate subject access and
            descriptive practices are a social justice issue and a moral imperative.” They provide
            examples of the transformations they have made to subject headings used in metadata,
            such as switching “Abused Indian children,” the LCSH, to “Abused Indigenous children.”
            In class, students have seemed excited about the possibility of such a project,
            especially the notion of descriptive metadata practices as they relate to social justice
            issues, and how this might alter how publics access and understand information they
            encounter on the Web. One student commented that she “never had thought about these
            things before, like how racist or gendered metadata could be. I’d really never thought
            about metadata at all.” She reflected that the components of the Omeka project had even
            caused her to rethink what she sees on her personal social media accounts (like
            Instagram and Facebook) and YouTube.</p>
         <p>The process of creating this course project raises the question of how we can be mindful
            of not replicating colonialism in new ways. As discussed above, the process of metadata
            creation seems simple enough on the surface, but in reality is a more complex venture.
            As Roopika Risam advises, we must be wary of the violence that occurs in “discursive
            forms,” such as “reproducing colonial influences in the production of digital knowledge
            and centering epistemologies and ontologies of the Global North . . . which in turn
            decenters those of Indigenous communities and the Global South” (2018, 2). For those of
            us who practice art history, we must be cognizant of how metadata — and digital tools
            and projects beyond this — has the ability to act as a neocolonial dynamic, and one that
            situates the Global North as “the site of knowledge production.”<note> See also

               knowledge, and DH.</note>
         </p>
         <p>&lt;Access and the Digital Divide&gt;</p>
         <p>Access to materials, whether to digital photographs (or videos) or to archival or
            scholarly materials about colonial Latin American visual culture, impinges upon what and
            how we teach and research. High-resolution images are essential for teaching and
            research, and more than half of the survey’s respondents mentioned the need for their
            greater availability. Among the many reasons increased accessibility is needed,
            respondents listed the high cost of travel and the many international collections that
            now possess colonial Latin American objects, as well as the lack of high-res images in
            repositories like ArtStor or Bridgeman Images. For the latter, there is also a fee to
            acquire them. Moreover, as the academy continues to rely on adjunct labor with absurdly
            low pay, the need for free, open access to materials was noted as imperative. One
            response indicated that with greater access to objects and places that are less well
            known (if at all) the conversations around colonial Latin American art could also
            noticeably shift. </p>
         <p>Besides access to high-resolution digital images, participants noted that certain
            digital tools or projects also could bypass pay-walled journals with costly
            subscriptions or academic presses that sell materials at high costs, all of which are
            largely inaccessible without access to a university library. As one respondent noted,
            DAH projects about Latin American visual culture challenge how and where knowledge is
            stored; rather than solely in academic journals or printed books, DAH projects have the
            potential to remove burdensome financial costs, to provide free access to anyone
            untethered to a university system, and to allow for more collaboration across
            international borders. </p>
         <p>While access to more visual and textual materials was noted as a priority for
            researching and teaching about Latin American visual culture, respondents also noted
            that digitization initiatives and DAH projects have important limitations. One
            respondent worried about the implications of a project’s obsolescence. Several commented
            on the issue of collections (visual or archival) that do not have the funds or equipment
            to digitize their materials, or individuals who do not receive funding to produce and
            maintain a project online. Their concern is that research agendas and general trends in
            the field could therefore be determined on what is and is not available digitally. Mundy
            and Leibsohn (2017) agree that a canon of Latin American visual culture has formed
            around what has been made more available in the digital domain. This is also true for
            printed texts, such as those digitized for Google Books. Any library that has not
            provided access to Google Inc. will have considerably less traffic, which affects
            current and future research. This could then profoundly alter the production of
            knowledge about Latin American colonial history and art, as well as the cultural
            heritage of the many peoples and countries who have a connection to it. In my viceregal
            art class, this was certainly the case. Students tended to rely primarily on sources
            that could be found online, such as e-books through the university’s library portal,
            Google Books, the Getty Research Portal, or the John Carter Brown Library.</p>
         <p>Open access to knowledge and to visual materials are important, and the immediacy they
            afford us has the potential to upset problematic aspects facing the academy (such as
            budget cuts, less time to travel, and the increase in adjunct labor) and the destruction
            or loss of cultural heritage. But who gets to grant this access? And should all
            knowledge and imagery be made more accessible? Risam (2018) and Afanador Llach (2019)
            rightly remind us that the notion that information is and should be free is an
            assumption of the Global North, one that does not necessarily accord with Indigenous
            communities of the Global South. Even universal access to the Web is, as
            Rodríguez-Ortega states, a myth (2013a, 131; see also 2018). A huge portion of the
            world’s population is still without access to the internet, and it is worth reflecting
            how the digital practices we engage in could potentially further this digital divide. </p>
         <p>The issue of access is also one of language. English is the lingua franca of the Web,
            which can be another barrier for anyone who does not know or use English (Afanador Llach
            2019; Rodríguez-Ortega 2013a, 131). It can deepen the digital divide. Many DAH projects
            centered around colonial Latin American art are in English, though there are also
            examples of bilingual projects (e.g., Digital Códice Mendoza) that offer excellent
            models for moving forward. As students in my class have wondered, what attempts have
            been made or can be made to sidestep the perpetual dominance of the Global North as
            gatekeepers to knowledge? Collaboration, as noted in the questionnaire responses and
            among students, seems to offer an appealing solution to how we can ensure greater
            accessibility and perspectives. </p>
         <p>&lt;Collaboration, Image Design and Manipulation, and the (In)Visibility of
            Labor&gt;</p>
         <p>Final issues that warrant discussion are collaboration, image design and manipulation,
            and the labor involved in creating digitized materials or DAH projects. In the classes
            on viceregal art described above, each team crafts their own Omeka exhibition, with the
            team designing a theme and an introductory statement that frames each individual’s
               entries.<note> See Kilroy-Ewbank 2018 for another example of this practice.</note>
            Students are graded on both components, as well as the feedback they offer to their team
            members. As noted above in the metadata discussion, there are steps that students must
            learn before they create these online exhibitions. They need to understand how to create
            metadata, as well as to determine how to source images in the public domain or take
            their own photographs, upload images as items, create and arrange pages, and write for
            diverse publics (Kilroy-Ewbank 2017a, 2017b, 2018). It requires scaffolding of smaller
            assignments from the semester’s beginning. </p>
         <p> After our discussion about metadata and how to create it, another assignment asks teams
            to decide on their exhibition’s theme after visiting a local museum collection of
            Spanish colonial art, such as LACMA’s. Students are asked to photograph their chosen
            objects that will form the core of their individual component. Before they observe
            objects on display at the museum, I initiate a conversation about what these photographs
            could or should look like, how many they might take, and whether the photos might need
            to be “corrected” or manipulated in some capacity. This conversation usually begins with
            quizzical looks. As one student later reflected, “I’ve never been asked before [in an
            art history class] to consider how I take photos or what I might need to do to make them
            look beautiful.” This discussion inevitably returns us to the importance of how we frame
            or reframe art, how digital images shift the production of knowledge and our
            understanding of colonial Latin American art, and how the choices we make to show or not
            to show specific aspects of an object or building can alter how someone understands it.
            We watch a Smarthistory video to discuss how the visual choices made in it might affect
            how we understand a specific work of art and how the visuals create an argument. <note>
               I typically have students watch Smarthistory videos <hi rend="italic">not</hi>
               related to Spanish colonial art, including <hi rend="italic">Augustus of
                  Primaporta</hi> (<ref target="https://youtu.be/3i8iou6tXqY"
                  >https://youtu.be/3i8iou6tXqY</ref>) or Polykleitos’s <hi rend="italic"
                  >Doryphoros</hi> (<ref target="https://youtu.be/EAR9RAMg9NY"
                  >https://youtu.be/EAR9RAMg9NY</ref>). </note> On occasion, it has also raised
            thought-provoking discussions about labor, both visible and invisible, that broached
            larger issues involved in digitized and DAH, namely how we assign credit for the work
            being done. </p>
         <p> To provide a brief example, one team framed their exhibition around sacred imagery. One
            student chose Arellano’s <title rend="italic">Virgin of Guadalupe</title> to probe
            localized sacred imagery specifically. At LACMA, he brought his expensive camera and
            took dozens of photographs in the manner of Smarthistory’s Steven Zucker, the student’s
            cited model (Zucker 2018). He not only took photographs of the entire painting but
            numerous details, as well as photographs of the painting from the side and in relation
            to objects displayed near it, from far away within the gallery space, with visitors in
            front of the painting, and in black-and-white. The student either already knew or
            learned how to use image manipulation software like Adobe Photoshop because his
            resulting images also included callouts, highlights, color correction, complicated
            cropping, and straightening. </p>
         <p>During the peer review process, this student’s component was met with both wonder and
            anxiety by his fellow teammates. They were concerned that his images were of such high
            quality so as to make their own individual essays look less legitimate or less serious.
            Most students took photos on their smartphones and had not manipulated them; they were
            blurry, dark, and crooked, and some had not captured portions of the object itself. The
            team member with high-quality photographs offered to share his expertise but wondered if
            the time he spent helping his teammates to improve their resulting digital images would
            negatively impact his own project because he would have less time to focus on it. </p>
         <p>In the end, the process prompted an unexpected but important conversation about how
            digitized images affect our perceptions of digital projects and about the labor involved
            in creating them. I was reminded of Daniela Bleichmar’s discussion of colonial Latin
            American art and visual epistemology, or “the role of visuality as a way of knowing, and
            the process of observation, collecting, representation, and circulation that were
            integral to the production of knowledge” (2015, 240). Pairing Bleichmar’s essay with the
            work they were doing in class proved especially generative, with students finding
            compelling parallels between processes and projects of the past with those in their
            digital present. Importantly, it also encouraged students to revisit online projects
            that we had discussed in class to think critically about how the material is presented
            and how this creates a digital and visual argument. It also stimulated a great deal of
            dialogue about the need for more accessible high-resolution images of colonial Latin
            American visual culture, a point that the questionnaire’s respondents repeatedly
            emphasized. </p>
         <p>Another important point the above example illuminates is the labor involved in
            digitization, whether of books or images, or in digital work, such as working
            collaboratively. A great deal of labor goes uncited, unnoticed, as has been addressed
            more recently by many working in the Digital Humanities (e.g. Keralis 2016; Graban,
            Marty, Romano, and Vandergrift 2019). In her written reflection, a student pointed out
            that the invisibility of this labor calls to mind the invisibility of labor used to
            create the art and architecture of the sixteenth-century Spanish Americas. Even when the
            creator of digital content is known, such as the photographer who took certain photos
            and made them available on Flickr Commons, there is a great deal of labor that might go
            unaccounted for. Image manipulation can be time consuming, and to get it “just right”
            varies depending on the creator. Individuals responsible for digitizing materials in
            museums, archives, or libraries, whether for an institution’s website (such as the
            Metropolitan Museum of Art or Mexico’s Archivo General de la Nación) or a large
            corporate entity (such as Google Books) are almost never named. Crowdsourcing, for
            projects like PESSCA or the recent ALAA digital art history resources page, is not free
            or visible labor, as a recent blog post on the Getty Iris also mentions (Deines et al.
            2018). <note> PESSCA is the Project on the Engraved Sources of Spanish Colonial Art
                  (<ref target="https://colonialart.org/">https://colonialart.org/</ref>). ALAA is
               the Association of Latin American Art, and its digital resources page is found here:
                  <ref target="https://associationlatinamericanart.org/digital-resources/"
                  >https://associationlatinamericanart.org/digital-resources/</ref>.</note> The
            concern of my student, who offered to share his photoshopping expertise, about his time
            and labor raised this issue on a micro-scale within the classroom. </p>
         <div>
            <head>A Final Reflection</head>
            <p>“Creating metadata and making an [Omeka] exhibit were totally new experiences for me.
               . . . Both processes made the art [of the Spanish Americas] far more accessible to me
               and help[ed] me develop better critical thinking skills about what I see online. . .
               . They also made me feel uncomfortable because I think my generation just assumes all
               stuff online is true, even when teachers tell us it isn’t. But now I kinda get it.”
               This statement, in a student’s final reflection, sums up much of what I have been
               discussing here and the relationship between the digital, colonial Latin American
               art, and pedagogy. As is clear from this class project, digital art history can
               disturb and disrupt how students approach colonial Latin American art. As I hope this
               essay demonstrates, while the digital turn offers many positive ways in which we can
               rethink and reframe art history and specifically the visual culture of colonial Latin
               America, it seems mindful to be wary of the notion that it can create a false
               perception of a techno-utopia in which all creators and users are equal, and
               information is always readily accessible and objective. </p>
