                  <p>Previous studies indicate that the capacity of media to influence the salience of
                     issues in the public realm is strongly dependent on specific attributes that
                     characterize these issues. In this work, we investigate two <em class="emph">internal</em> aspects of issue
                     types related to the attribute of <em class="emph">duration</em>. First, we address whether news stories
                     belonging to different issue types can be identified and represented using a set of
                     quantifiable temporal dimensions (i.e. lifespan, intensity, and burstiness). Second,
                     we conduct a qualitative analysis to investigate whether news stories of different
                     issue types have different <em class="emph">narrative patterns</em>, regardless of their specific topic. We
                     use a corpus of 50,385 political news articles in Spanish from 2018 as a case study,
                     and propose a novel system to aggregate the articles into stories. Our results show
                     that stories belonging to different issue types do have distinguishing behaviours,
                     especially along the intensity dimension. At the same time, the qualitative analysis
                     indicates a tendency to associate narrative patterns to issue types. This analysis
                     shows the potential of using news stories as research units to study framing
                     strategies. </p>

                     that readers not only get informed through news media but also get to grasp the
                     salience of a specific issue on the basis of the amount of information that is
                     published about it [<a class="ref" href="#mccombs1972">McCombs and Shaw 1972</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#scheufele2006">Scheufele and Tewksbury 2006</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#wanta2006">Wanta Ghanem 2006</a>].
                     Whereas mass media could function as gatekeepers that determined which
                     issues became news, and thus public [<a class="ref" href="#shoemaker2013">Shoemaker and Reese 2013</a>], this is more

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">The volume of journalistic articles published by print media has been increasing
                     steadily since the emergence of the World Wide Web [<a class="ref" href="#gomezrodriguez2014">Gómez-Rodríguez et al. 2014</a>].
                     The transition from paper to the digital format has removed the
                     barrier of space limits allowing online media to publish a virtually unlimited amount
                     of documents. News organizations compete with each other but also with other agents
                     about the attention of news users. In this attention economy the speed of the news
                     cycle has tremendously risen. Studying how news circulates in the information ecology
                     and the dynamics of how broader news stories are constructed and put on the public
                     agenda is therefore increasingly important [<a class="ref" href="#broersma2019">Broersma 2019</a>]. At the same time, this
                     limitless space can be used by digital media to silence some topics and emphasize

                     digital news, the frequent publication of articles about a story has become a source
                     of power in digital reporting. Thus, it becomes important to regard the <em class="emph">temporality</em>
                     of news and the <em class="emph">timing</em> that newspapers use to inform about a story. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">A relevant terminological distinction is the difference between a news article and
                     a
                     news story. A news article is a <em class="term">unitary mention</em> of a potentially larger sequence of
                     events. A news story is a <em class="term">unitary sequence</em> of events that can be reconstructed by
                     aggregating multiple unitary mentions (i.e. news articles). For instance, a news
                     article on the arrest of a suspect (i.e., a unitary mention) can be embedded as a
                     component in a news story of a specific crime. Focusing on news stories allows us
                     to
                     understand how news organizations produce meaning by making sense of various news
                     events and interpreting them as parts of larger societal developments and
                     discussions. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">The lifespan of digital news articles, i.e. unitary mentions, has been previously
                     investigated by observing how long a specific news article remains in a salient
                     position (e.g. the front page) [<a class="ref" href="#karlsson2010">Karlsson and Strömbäck 2010</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#lee2014">Lee et al. 2014</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#castillo2014">Castillo et al. 2014</a>].
                     However, in the digital realm, news stories have gained
                     more prominence, as articles remain accessible and are connected to each other
                     [<a class="ref" href="#bright2014">Bright 2014</a>]. This new environment points at the need for aggregation
                     strategies that facilitate the study of news reporting [<a class="ref" href="#trilling2020">Trilling and van Hoof 2020</a>].
                     As Bødker and Brügger (2018) observe, digital newspapers have switched from an
                     archival logic to constructing stories based on networks of links. Hereby, they put
                     the focus on the story as an organizing principle, rather than on the journalistic
                     filtering of the front page. Following Bødker and Brügger (2018), we consider stories
                     as our minimal units of analysis (cf. [<a class="ref" href="#widholm2016">Widholm 2016</a>]).</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">Focusing on stories rather than on news articles enables us to investigate the
                     temporal dimensions of newspapers' online reporting. We build on Soroka (2002), who
                     developed a typology that focuses on the attributes of the reported issue when
                     evaluating the effects of agenda-setting. This framework argues that the capacity
                     of
                     media to influence the salience of a particular issue depends on its attributes,
                     namely: (1) <em class="emph">obtrusiveness</em>; (2) <em class="emph">abstractness</em>; (3) <em class="emph">dramatism</em>; and (4) <em class="emph">duration</em>. Using
                     the first three attributes (i.e. obtrusiveness; abstractness; and dramatism) Soroka
                     develops a three-fold issue-typology that distinguishes between <em class="term">sensational</em>,
                     <em class="term">governmental</em> and <em class="term">prominent</em> issues. Duration is not fully included in his framework,
                     conceivably, because issues on their own do not have an attribute of duration. Issues
                     need to be identified as stories in order to have a temporal dimension. In this
                     article, we investigate how duration contributes to agenda-setting through three
                     quantitative dimensions, namely: (1) <em class="emph">lifespan</em> (number of consecutive days that
                     articles keep being published), (2) <em class="emph">intensity</em> (amount of articles per day), and (3)
                     <em class="emph">burstiness</em> (speed of increase/decrease of the number of articles). Our goal is to
                     examine whether the three types of news issues defined by Soroka can be
                     differentiated along these quantitative temporal dimensions.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">We design a methodology that extracts all the salient stories in digital newspapers
                     over a fixed period of time. Our approach uses <em class="emph">k</em>-means clustering on the set of
                     articles of each relevant time span of the target period. It then links the clusters
                     through time by looking at the cosine similarities of their content. The stories are
                     later manually assigned to one of the three types: sensational, governmental or
                     prominent, according to a specific decision tree (see Fig. 4). We have used the data
                     of four Spanish newspapers during the entire period of 2018, scraped from their
                     archives on the section about <em class="emph">politics</em>, and used weeks as relevant time spans to
                     aggregate single news articles. What we present here is a case study on journalism,
                     while the proposed methodology can be applied to other dimensions of variations or
                     types of text. For instance, recent initiatives on digitization and analysis of
                     historical newspapers (e.g., <a href="https://www.newseye.eu" onclick="window.open('https://www.newseye.eu'); return false" class="ref">NewsEye</a>,
                     <a href="https://impresso-project.ch" onclick="window.open('https://impresso-project.ch'); return false" class="ref">Impresso</a>) could use our methodology to 
                     explore the historical evolution of issue types. On the other hand, its application
                     (with minor changes) to literary texts can support computational textual studies in
                     identifying coherent sequences of events and thus contribute to the advancements in
                     the area of computational narratology. </div>

                        time <em class="emph">t</em>, and then connect them to other mentions in other

                        to the complexity of the task and the low performance of such automatic systems
                        [<a class="ref" href="#beheshti2017">Beheshti et al. 2017</a>], previous work has mainly employed topic detection and
                        tracking techniques through the use of clustering. Clustering is an unsupervised
                        machine learning technique that automatically organizes a collection of objects
                        into smaller coherent groups. The end goal is to have clusters whose elements are
                        as similar as possible between them (intra-cluster similarity) and as dissimilar
                        as possible from the elements in the other clusters (inter-cluster similarity).
                        This implies that we cannot determine a priori which criteria are going to define

                        the use of clustering to identify news stories is very challenging. Some
                        approaches have tried to improve the performance of this task by incorporating
                        properties of news stories, such as timing features [<a class="ref" href="#khy2008">Khy et al. 2008</a>]

                        system and, consequently, they cannot be part of the design. Named entities have
                        also limited value, since the actors or places appearing in different news stories
                        can be common between stories. </div>

                        climaxes. As the cluster gets bigger (by iteratively adding new articles from
                        succeeding weeks), it becomes more difficult for the clusters emerging from new
                        climaxes to share 33% of the articles with the existing bigger cluster (see end of
                        Section 3.B). As a result, this story is represented with multiple clusters
                        instead of just one. We considered applying a more fine-grained clustering to
                        distinguish more specific sub-stories from the more general story <em class="emph">Catalan independence referendum</em>. However, this harms the
                        identification of smaller stories about other topics, making them disappear. A
                        single story being the main story throughout the year is not a common situation.
                        But it can happen in cases of big events like Brexit in the UK in 2018 or Covid-19
                        in 2020. To obviate these problems and also to be able to better generalize our
                        observations, we decided to exclude this large story from our analysis. </div>

                        decisions about political freedoms. Two of them are decisions from the European
                        Court of Human Rights (ECHR) that contradict previous decisions of a Spanish
                        court<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e903">[8]</a>,
                        and a third one is the final resolution from a Spanish court, which will later be
                        appealed to ECHR.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e912">[9]</a>
                        These three stories follow a similar content structure. They start with an article
                        that explains the court decision, with very similar headlines in all newspapers.
                        Then, some newspapers report about the reactions of the government and the
                        political actors in favour or against the decision. In the case of the two
                        European court decisions (in which the tribunal ruled in favour of political
                        freedom), the reactions are published the same day. In the one coming from a
                        Spanish court (which was accused of ruling against freedom of speech), the
                        reactions are not reported until the day after, making the second day of the story
                        its climax. This shows either less previous attention to the case, or a more
                        unexpected decision compared to the other two court cases, which had already been
                        in the news in the past. The days of the falling action mainly consist of articles
                        about the precedents and the consequences, and opinion pieces. </div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p59">We observe a similar pattern in stories about corruption. On the first day of
                        reporting, multiple articles about the event itself are published. These are
                        followed by reactions from other political actors, and some articles about the
                        context. Finally, in the last days, the articles about the consequences and the
                        opinion pieces are the most common. It can be noticed that two of the stories get
                        to their climax on the second day of reporting. In the first case, the corruption
                        case forces the resignation of the politician involved, making this second event
                        the main climax of the story.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e921">[10]</a>
                        This story spans two days, and there are two days of climax. However, in the
                        second story of this kind,<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e927">[11]</a>
                        reporting starts the day before the court decision. This is an interesting case,
                        as one newspaper published several articles about the background of the corruption
                        case the day before the final sentence. This unusual behaviour seems to indicate a
                        willingness to emphasize this particular story by this media outlet. </div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p60">Governmental stories are often political discussions or legal debates, which have
                        set timings, often known in advance by journalists. The planned nature of
                        governmental stories gives space for a longer build-up to the story, which results
                        in a longer rising action. In Figure 9, it can be observed that governmental
                        stories tend to have more than one peak (we will also call these sub-climax). For
                        this typology, the curve of the smoothed conditional mean in the main climax is
                        less pronounced and multiple peaks can be observed along the span of the stories
                        (thin lines), mainly in the rising action, but also in the falling action. The
                        rising action of governmental stories takes on average 6.5 days, a difference
                        statistically significant with respect to sensational stories. The average falling
                        action, on the other hand, is similar to sensational stories, lasting around 4
                        days.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p61">At first glance, there are no clear narrative patterns for stories belonging to
                        this issue type. In Figure 10, it can be observed that stories with 3 to 6 days of
                        rising action and 0 to 2 days of falling action are common. These stories have
                        generally one single peak (one climax). However, the big majority of the stories
                        in this typology do not fit in the main pattern represented in Fig. 10. We do
                        observe a common feature between the non-represented stories: most of them have 2
                        to 4 different peaks (1 climax and 1 to 3 sub-climax). In Figure 10, these stories
                        are identified in dark red. We observe two kinds of narrative patterns in
                        governmental stories, (1) short-spanning stories with one climax, and (2) multiple
                        sub-climax stories. </div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p62">The first kind of stories are generally planned events, with a relatively low
                        media interest, such as the birthday of the King, a vote on the internal statutes
                        of a party, or the visit of the President to Cuba. In the days previous to the
                        climax, these stories start growing by publishing articles about the context,
                        previous similar events and the details on how the central event is going to take
                        place. Also, some opinions of known political actors and some speculation about
                        unknown facts. On the central day of the event, detailed descriptions about how it
                        went are published. In most of the cases, the effects or possible consequences of
                        the central event are published the same day, leaving 0 to 1 days of falling
                        action. If there are opinion pieces, which is not always the case, they are part
                        of the rising action.</div>

                        due to disagreements on the issue by different actors. These stories start like
                        the first kind: they are planned, and the press knows when the involved characters
                        are going to talk about the issue. However, after the first peak, in which a
                        personality has shown its position/decision, new peaks come from other actors

                        Though, a larger peak is created when the person who was appointed to be the

                     <div class="ptext" id="p69">In 2018, the yearly uprising of pensions was 0.25%, while prices had risen around
                        3%. This caused indignation, and the first demonstrations took place in the middle
                        of January. However, <cite class="title italic">Pensions</cite> does not emerge as a news
                        story until the 8th of February, the day in which the Prime Minister announced
                        some measures to incentivize private retirement funds. From then on, there were
                        demonstrations every week in many cities, with a large one on the 22th of
                        February. After this date, the opposition parties started discussing the topic and
                        the media coverage focused on the politicians, even though the demonstrations kept
                        taking place. On the 14th of March, there was a Parliament session focusing
                        exclusively on the topic of pensions. This day is the highest peak of the story.
                        The Parliament session did not have a clear outcome, and even bigger
                        demonstrations took place after that. By that point, the topic of pensions had
                        become the main point in the political agenda, becoming the trading issue for
                        parties negotiating the national budget (which is a governmental topic). </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p71">In this work we have defined news stories as <em class="emph">unitary sequences</em>
                     of events that can be reconstructed by aggregating multiple unitary mentions, i.e.
                     news articles. Our work focused on the development of a semi-automatic method that
                     can be used to facilitate the application of empirical analysis in media studies
                     using large quantities of data. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p72">We have shown that clustering methods can be effectively applied to identify news
                     stories, and that news stories are a meaningful unit of analysis. Our approach still
                     requires some manual intervention and background knowledge from the researcher.
                     Rather than a limitation, we consider this a virtuous way to combine quantitative
                     and
                     qualitative analysis to large corpora or collections of datasets. It has proven
                     efficient when applied to an automatically scraped corpus of 50,385 news articles
                     in
                     Spanish, with a purity score of 0.896. A further advantage is represented by its
                     language independent nature: there is no language specific module to pre-process the
                     data, and the story identification is completely unsupervised. Some drawbacks,
                     however, remain unsolved, like the difficulty to deal with very large stories (see
                     Section 4.A). An additional aspect that will be further investigated is the
                     validation of the proposed decision tree for story type classification by means of
                     an
                     extensive inter-annotator agreement study. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p73">As a case study, we attempted an empirical validation of Soroka’s issue-typology,
                     and
                     especially of the temporal dimension, an aspect that was ignored in the original
                     framework. Time has been quantitatively proxied by three attributes of news stories:
                     lifespan, intensity, and burstiness. We hypothesized for sensational stories to have
                     a short lifespan, a high intensity and a high burstiness and we expected prominent
                     and governmental issues to have a longer lifespan and a lower intensity. The results
                     of the quantitative study using the three temporal attributes showed that, when it
                     comes to time, stories belonging to different issue types differentiate only to some
                     extent. In particular, only <em class="emph">intensity</em> appears as a significant
                     differentiation attribute, especially for sensational stories. This can be explained
                     by both news values and commercial motivations. Sensational stories such as natural
                     disasters and murders are unexpected, and thus get much attention when they break.
                     Moreover, these stories are able to attract many readers and thus create traffic to
                     news websites. To do justice to their perceived importance and to maximize the effect
                     of such stories, news organizations publish in a relatively short amount of time many
                     articles about them [<a class="ref" href="#harcup2017">Harcup and O'Neill 2017</a>]. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p74">We complemented the quantitative study with a more qualitative analysis inspired by
                     narratology frameworks. In particular, we applied the notion of plot structure to
                     analyse whether there are further distinguishing elements across the types of
                     stories. We thus attempted to measure and visualize the narrative patterns of the
                     types of stories, and in particular, the rising actions, climax, and falling actions.
                     We observed that the days of the rising action are significantly lower in sensational
                     stories compared to governmental stories, while falling actions are similar. A very
                     common trait in governmental stories is having multiple peaks, which correspond to
                     different stages of the political debate. It is interesting to point out that
                     prominent stories have been the least covered stories over the year we analysed. They
                     also had very short falling actions, with the exception of one story. </div>

                     studies, our method can help in identifying and aggregating subplots in novels. The
                     code is open and accessible. Required changes are minimal, and in particular they
                     concern the input data and the adaptation of the empirical thresholds for the
                     identification of the elements belonging to a cluster and the merging of the stories
                     over time. At the same time, our methodology can be used to investigate the evolution
                     of issue types in a diachronic perspective, providing an additional level of analysis

                     especially where the application of computational text analysis methods is involved.
                     Being semi-automatic, our proposed methodology leaves the human in control while the
                     machine is a support to deal with large amounts of data. Once a news story is
                     identified, more fine-grained levels of analysis can be applied. We have applied core
                     concepts from narratology to non-literary texts, opening a new direction in
                     computational narratology. As already stated, having access to plot structures can
                     help investigating variations in writing styles: not only there can be differences
                     across issue types, but it would be interesting to investigate whether there are
                     differences across the components of a plot structure (i.e., rising action, climax,
                     and falling action). In addition to this, having access to stories rather than single
                     unitary mentions can facilitate the investigation of framing and whether this mirrors
