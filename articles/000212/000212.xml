            <p>Materiality Comics is a digital comic produced with a combination of Bitstrips and
               Comic Life. It argues and visually demonstrates that materiality is an important
               topic for comics scholars to consider, and that through creating essays in comics
               form, comics scholars can develop insights about materiality that are unavailable
               when analyzing comics by others.</p>

            <head>Creator's Statement</head>
         <p>This was one of the hardest academic projects of my career. I am neither a trained
            artist nor a trained programmer, and by far the greatest obstacle I faced in starting
            this project was my own lack of confidence. Now I understand how my students feel when I
            ask them to write essays in comic or game form. Nonetheless, I feel not only amazed that
            I finished this project, but also proud of how it turned out. </p>
         <p>Nonetheless, I was excited to do this project because it gave me an answer to the
            question of how digital humanities – or practice-based research, or critical making –
            could be made to work for me. As a Brittain Fellow at Georgia Tech, I saw my colleagues
            doing complicated-sounding things like corpus analysis and visualization and distant
            reading, and as a scholar whose work focuses on comics rather than the sorts of texts
            usually analyzed with DH methods, I didn’t see how these methods were relevant to my
            work. One inspiration for this project, therefore, was to use comics to do
            practice-based digital research, and to implicitly argue that comics could be an
            effective means of conducting such research. Most of my theoretical arguments on this
            point did not survive into the final draft, yet <title rend="quotes">Materiality Comics</title> is still influenced
            by my conviction that making comics is an effective means of theorizing comics. It
            therefore connects with the recent exciting work done in this area by scholars like Nick
            Sousanis, Jason Helms and Jarod Roselló. </p>
         <p>My specific goal in this project was to demonstrate that materiality is a useful rubric
            for theorizing comics, and that making comics can be an effective way of experimenting
            with and learning about materiality. This argument is explicitly stated in the captions
            and word balloons, but is also visually demonstrated by the wide range of visual
            materials included in the comic, ranging from hand drawings to photographs to public
            domain images from the Internet. (An important parenthetical note here is that my goal
            throughout was to make this comic visually interesting
            <emph>as a comic.</emph> Previous drafts included a large
            number of panels that just depicted my Bitstrips avatar standing in front of a classroom
            and lecturing. In the final draft, I sought to reduce the number of such panels as much
            as possible, and to make each panel visually interesting.) I also sought to demonstrate
            that comics can explore questions of materiality through their verbal as well as their
            visual content. Inspired by my scholarly interests in typography and handwriting, I used
            as many different typographic styles as possible, and even included one page which
            consists <emph>only </emph>of text, yet nonetheless
            <soCalled>counts</soCalled> as a comic because its text blocks are juxtaposed to each other in a sequential
            fashion. I thus seek to demostrate that text in comics matters not just because of what
            it says but also because of what it looks like, and that for this reason, comics can
            guide our interpretation of other text-based media. In this regard, <title rend="quotes">Materiality Comics</title>
            takes inspiration from other recent work on the visual and material properties of text,
            such as Lori Emerson’s
            <title rend="italic">Reading Writing Interfaces</title> and Katherine
            Hayles and Jessica Pressman’s edited collection
            <title rend="italic">Comparative Textual Media.</title></p>
         <p>The process by which this work was created is also proof of its argument that making
            comics is an effective way of learning about materiality. I chose to create this comic
            digitally both because of its DH focus and because given my lack of drawing ability or
            experience, completing a 20-page comic with pen and paper was out of the question. (For
            similar reasons, I typically offer my students the option to create longer comics
            projects with Bitstrips or Pixton instead of by hand.) I initially considered executing
            this project with Javascript or InDesign, but because of my lack of coding proficiency
            and my unfamiliarity with the latter program, I ultimately created my project using a
            combination of Bitstrips and Comic Life. The former is a free online comics creator tool
            and the latter is a proprietary application for designing comics pages. Neither program
            was sufficient on its own, because Bitstrips offers only rudimentary support for
            designing unique page layouts and has a limited repertory of fonts, while Comic Life
            only allows preexisting images to be imported and does not contain its own facilities
            for creating images. Therefore, creating <title rend="quotes">Materiality Comics</title> was an exercise in
            bricolage, in which I designed panels in Bitstrips or took photos with my phone, then
            imported them into Comic Life. In the process I learned much about the constraints and
            affordances of both programs. For example, it was surprisingly difficult to get images
            in Comic Life to display at both the correct size and the correct aspect ratio,
            and determining the correct size for the panel gutters required painstaking trial and
            error. This is exactly the sort of insight that, as I argue in the essay (19.4), is only
            available when we make comics ourselves rather than analyzing comics created by others.
            By making our own comics, we as comics scholars can learn about the medium from a
            practical perspective, and these practical insights can inform our theorization of
            comics. This, indeed, is precisely why I ask my students to do projects in comics form,
            and I feel proud that I have finally succeeded in making my research match my thinking. </p>
