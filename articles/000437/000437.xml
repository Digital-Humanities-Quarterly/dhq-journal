                <!-- Include a brief abstract of the article -->
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">Finite Media</hi>, Sean Cubitt first examines a myriad of
                    situations in which our media have material consequences for the earth and its
                    inhabitants, clearly laying out the need for change on a massive scale.
                    Thorough, complex, and effective, Cubitt’s book makes its largest contribution
                    to ongoing discussions of digital humanities in the Anthropocene in arguing that
                    humanity must change its relationship to media by embracing a new eco-political
                    aesthetic.</p>

            <head/>
            <p>In the midst of what may now certainly be termed a climate crisis, Sean Cubitt’s
                conclusions in <title rend="italic">Finite Media</title> remind digital humanists
                once again that all DH must be Eco-critical DH, because each film strip, each Tweet,
                and each transmission sent within our network have material consequences for this
                planet Earth. Backing his analyses of this current state of affairs with myriad
                examples of the material impact of digital technologies, the author argues that this
                appreciation of media materiality must come to the forefront if we are to overcome a
                worldwide ecological disaster which refuses a traditional political or economic
                solution. Cubitt contends that today’s <cit><quote rend="inline"
                        source="#cubitt 2016">environmental criticism requires an elaborated theory
                        of mediation, a concept that <title rend="italic">Finite Media</title>
                        attempts to refine by testing it against the story of the materials that
                        media are made of</quote>
                    <ptr target="#cubitt2016" loc="11"/>.</cit>
                <title rend="italic">Finite Media</title> is Sean Cubitt’s latest book, following
                projects like <title rend="italic">Ecomedia</title>, <title rend="italic">Digital
                    Aesthetics</title>, and <title rend="italic">The Practice of Light: A Genealogy
                    of Visual Technologies from Prints to Pixels</title>, in which he has previously
                explored questions of media, ecology, technology, and culture.</p>
            <p>Cubitt illustrates that media are finite in their ties to material resources which
                are themselves finite; recognition of this fact and its implications for the planet
                and its inhabitants then serves as a foundation for a new eco-political aesthetic, a
                        <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#cubitt2016">revolution in
                        communications</quote>
                    <ptr target="#cubitt2016" loc="11"/>.</cit> To this end, in the first half of
                the book, the chapters <title rend="quotes">Energy</title> and <title rend="quotes"
                    >Matter</title> greet the reader with a deluge of thorough examples of how our
                media is affecting our world and its ecological resources, as well as those Native
                and Indigenous peoples and communities in the Global South who are most immediately,
                tragically, and too often quietly impacted by the material aspects of our media
                consumption. Cubitt approaches such various topics as the mining and refining of
                heavy metals and the creation of the Green Mpeg video codec primarily through the
                lens of political economy, and in a pattern which continues for the length of the
                book, his argument fluctuates deftly between highly complex theoretical work to
                concrete case studies. Upon concluding <title rend="quotes">Matter</title>, the
                reader is left with a distinct impression not only of our urgent ecological crisis
                and its ties to our media environment, but also of the inadequacy of the
                technological, economic, and political solutions with which humans have thus far
                reassured themselves that things will improve. In the latter two chapters, <title
                    rend="quotes">Eco-Political Aesthetics</title> and <title rend="quotes"
                    >Ecological Communication as Politics</title>, case studies recede in favor of a
                complex work of criticism which begins by asserting that <cit><quote rend="inline"
                        source="#cubitt2016">the usual levers we pull are not going to work</quote>
                    <ptr target="#cubitt2016" loc="215"/>.</cit> In this second half of the book,
                Cubitt steadily builds momentum, relying upon the previous stories of our media and
                their materiality in <title rend="quotes">Energy</title> and <title rend="quotes"
                    >Matter</title> to suggest that real change can only come from <cit><quote
                        rend="inline" source="#cubitt2016">a politics rebuilt on aesthetic
                        principles</quote>
                    <ptr target="#cubitt2016" loc="151"/>.</cit> For Cubitt, this means a new
                appreciation for <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#cubitt2016">the unimagined
                        beauty of a processual artifact in which the human encounters and engages
                        with ungoverned technological and natural process</quote>
                    <ptr target="#cubitt2016" loc="191"/>.</cit></p>
            <p>Far from a work which espouses and explores a single point of view, <title
                    rend="italic">Finite Media</title> instead embraces the truly complex nature of
                a difficult problem — one which defies an easy answer. Cubitt weaves together not
                only insights from political economy and the study of media as material, but
                aesthetics, environmental science, and postcolonialism as well. His success in doing
                so is paralleled by an extreme attention to detail. Few will be able to finish the
                first half of this book without feeling as though Cubitt has thoroughly done his
                homework, and that lends his arguments in the second half — which would otherwise at
                times appear quite abstract — clarity, immediacy, and tangibility.</p>
            <p>The book’s writing and structure itself occasionally distracts from this admirable
                accomplishment, however, as many readers — especially those unfamiliar with Cubitt’s
                theoretical foundations in political economy and materialism — may find that they
                must retrace the argument’s steps. This is not to say that the book is not
                well-written; on the contrary, Cubitt’s command of language makes itself evident in
                a concise and eloquent prose, one that encourages deep reading and reflection. The
                problem for many readers will instead lie in the sense that ideas often seem simply
                disconnected. Readers face this particularly in the first two chapters, <title
                    rend="quotes">Energy</title> and <title rend="quotes">Matter</title>, where the
                core ideas that drive them may be lost amid a sea of case studies and subheadings
                which too often fail to declare their intentions or connections with each other, and
                the goals of the chapter. Fortunately, Chapter Three, <title rend="quotes"
                    >Eco-political Aesthetics</title>, and Four, <title rend="quotes">Ecological
                    Communication as Politics</title>, are more clearly focused, tying all of the
                book’s constituent elements and examples together skillfully in its concluding
                pages.</p>
            <p> In 2014, having stated the current and future impacts of human activity on the
                planet and its nonhuman inhabitants with shocking clarity, Bethany Nowviskie asked,
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#nowviskie2014">what is a digital humanities
                    practice that grapples constantly with little extinctions and can look
                    clear-eyed on a Big One?</quote>
                <ptr target="#nowviskie2014"/>. Cubitt’s take on media in the anthropocene
                contributes to ongoing conversations within the digital humanities which seek to
                address this question. Cubitt sees his work in <title rend="italic">Finite
                    Media</title> following that of Grossman (2007), Feilhauer and Zehle (2009),
                Gabrys (2010), Maxwell and Miller (2012), and Parikka (2015). Parikka’s <title
                    rend="italic">A Geology of Media</title> pairs particularly well with <title
                    rend="italic">Finite Media</title> due not only due to timing, but due to a
                shared sense of scope and magnitude of humanity’s influence on the planet, past and
                present. Where Cubitt stays focused on the Anthropocene in its present reality as he
                tells the <quote rend="inline" source="#cubitt2016">story of the materials that
                    media are made of</quote> — the impact of matter and energy on people and
                environments today — Parikka tells similar stories in long-form by zooming out to
                the scale of deep geological time, much like Jeffrey Jerome Cohen does with a
                singular focus in <title rend="italic">Stone</title>. Nicole Starosielski’s <title
                    rend="italic">The Undersea Network</title>, also published in 2015, focuses
                intensely on one aspect of the vast media architecture laid out by books like <title
                    rend="italic">Finite Media</title> and Parikka’s <title rend="italic"
                    >Geology</title>, that of the political and ecological consequences of our
                reliance upon large fiber cables for high-speed internet. Like Cubitt, Starosielski
                considers the political, economic, and ecological impacts of our desire for swift
                communication — one sees the potential for treatments of each of the topics that
                Cubitt investigates in his chapters <title rend="quotes">Energy</title> and <title
                    rend="quotes">Matter</title> in similar detail. Ultimately, and in conjunction
                with works such as these, <title rend="italic">Finite Media</title>’s most stirring
                contribution to digital humanities in the Anthropocene is the idea of an
                eco-political solution which involves revising our aesthetic relationships to
                media.</p>
            <p> In endeavoring to prove and define a colossal, looming problem for humanity and
                offer a real solution, <title rend="italic">Finite Media</title> attempts a great
                task in exactly 200 pages — and it ultimately succeeds. Cubitt’s accomplished
                project will provide a new perspective and inform the work of scholars across the
                Digital Humanities, and in disciplines as varied as media studies, political
                economy, eco-criticism, critical theory, and postcolonialism. Moreover, in its focus
                on an aesthetic solution, it will inform and empower artists and media scholars who
                seek tangible ways to engage with the current ecological crisis.</p>
