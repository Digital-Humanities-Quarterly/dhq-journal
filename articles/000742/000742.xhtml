                  <p>In recent decades, archival institutions have digitized an enormous quantity of material
                     under the rubric of open access, including from 
                     colonial archives. However, much of the most sensitive material from these collections
                     remains undigitized or difficult to discover and 
                     use. More recently, a critical reconsideration of open digital access has also taken
                     place, particularly when it comes to sensitive 
                     material from the colonial archive. Collectively, this has created a situation in
                     which the colonial photography archive risks becoming 
                     overly sanitized as well as difficult to navigate and analyze.               
                     </p>
                  
                  <p>In this article, we propose that critical and transparent multimodal artificial intelligence
                     (AI) offers a way to improve access to 
                     colonial archives for researchers and the public, without losing sight of the need
                     for ethical approaches to sensitive visual 
                     materials. The EyCon (Early Conflict Photography and Visual AI) project assembled
                     a large database of sensitive visual materials from 
                     colonial conflicts and developed an experimental multi-modal computer vision tool
                     with which to analyze it. Though this tool has not yet 
                     been applied at scale or quantitatively compared with other approaches, we are able
                     to propose modes of inquiry for other researchers to 
                     explore as they create new research tools. On a more hypothetical or theoretical level,
                     we consider how the use of computational tools 
                     to facilitate access to and analysis of sensitive historical materials is compatible
                     with or even beneficial for more ethical approaches 
                     to such materials. We conclude with several promising areas for critically integrating
                     AI into the digital colonial archive, while also 
                     expanding on some limitations of such techniques.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">In recent decades, archival institutions have digitized an enormous quantity of material
                     under the rubric of open access, including from 
                     colonial archives. However, much of the most sensitive material from these collections
                     — particularly photographs depicting colonial 
                     violence — remains undigitized, or difficult to discover and use. More recently, a
                     critical reconsideration of open digital access has also 
                     taken place, particularly when it comes to sensitive material from the colonial archive.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e249">[1]</a> 
                     Photographic material presents a particularly tense point in the debate over access
                     and sensitivity, largely due to the longstanding notion 
                     that it is a “transparent” medium, one that bears an exact trace of the moment in which it is made.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e272">[2]</a> For this reason, photography is commonly perceived or experienced as a more 
                     immediate carrier of emotions — including painful or negative emotions — than other
                     kinds of documents or representations. Enormous 
                     quantities of photographic material have been digitized without sufficient contextual
                     metadata. What metadata exists was created by colonial 
                     institutions themselves, and the metadata thus may not respond to the questions researchers
                     want to ask. At the same time, particularly 
                     sensitive material largely remains hidden due in large part to increasing awareness
                     of ethical concerns. For these reasons, the digitally 
                     available colonial photography archive risks becoming overly sanitized as well as
                     difficult to navigate and analyze.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">In this article, we ask how machine learning (ML) might redress this problem. Specifically,
                     how might a set of ML-informed tools improve 
                     access and navigation for this sensitive digital archive?<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e293">[3]</a> We suggest 
                     that critical and transparent multimodal ML offers a way to improve access to colonial
                     archives for researchers and the public, without 
                     losing sight of the need for ethical approaches to sensitive visual materials. We
                     retrained a visual similarity algorithm using images 
                     degraded in order to appear like historical images and “stacked” the algorithm with a way of vectorizing textual metadata. Then, we 
                     applied this technique to our database, a very large corpus of colonial conflict photographs
                     collected from various archives in 
                     France and the UK. While not tested at scale, the results indicate potential for designing a search
                     interface that 
                     would provide better results than non-ML augmented digital databases and currently
                     available off-the-shelf ML tools available from Amazon 
                     and Google. While our reflections remain largely hypothetical, they are nonetheless
                     suggestive of a number of paths forward in using ML and 
                     computer vision on sensitive visual materials. This article explains the archival
                     problems presented by digitized photographs from the 
                     colonial period and then examines ways that ML-augmented computational approaches
                     might make access to such material both more robust and 
                     more sensitive to its political and ethical dimensions. We hope that this article
                     opens up modes of inquiry for other researchers to explore 
                     further as they create new research tools.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">Before moving on, a brief explanation of some of the central technical concepts is
                     in order. Machine learning (ML) is form of artificial 
                     intelligence (AI) that allows machines to learn from data without being programmed
                     directly. In traditional programming, the programmer 
                     writes rules in a coding language that the machine follows in order to turn input
                     data into appropriate solutions. In ML, the machine 
                     examines input data associated with a set of answers in order to figure out what the
                     corresponding rules should be. An ML system is 
                     “trained” rather than programmed — it is presented with many examples relevant to a given task
                     and then finds statistical structures 
                     in these examples that allows the system to come up with rules for automating the
                     task, which allows the system to generate solutions to 
                     new input data for which the answers have not already been provided. ML has turned
                     out to be much more effective than traditional computer 
                     programming at allowing computers to figure out problems involving tasks analogous
                     to human perception, such as image tagging and 
                     classification, speech recognition, and natural language translation [<a class="ref" href="#chollet_2021">Chollet 2021</a>]. Indeed, the advent of a type of ML model 
                     called a convolutional neural network (CNN) has made it possible to analyze visual
                     material in digital archives at scale. For example, 
                     Thomas Smits and Melvin Wevers have used a CNN to explore visual aspects of a very large digitized archive of Dutch
                     
                     newspapers in order to automatically detect variables such as the changing medium
                     of illustrations over time (engravings vs. halftones), the
                     styles of illustrated advertising, and the most common visual forms in the press <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#smit_wevers_2021">#smit_wevers_2021</a></span>. By “multimodal” 
                     ML, we mean the use of an ML model that performs different kinds of operations on
                     different input data, combining or “stacking” these 
                     different operations to produce more robust results. Our proposed model's network
                     architecture includes a CNN to perform operations on 
                     “visual” data in pixel values, combined with a network that analyzes textual metadata in associated
                     picture captions.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e333">[4]</a>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">The EyCon (Early Conflict Photography and Visual AI) project proposes a number of
                     AI techniques to analyze a database of sensitive visual 
                     material from colonial conflicts. Working with a consortium of British and French
                     archives, EyCon scanned non-digitized material and 
                     gathered together already-digitized material into a trans-imperial image database
                     that mixes different forms of photograph supports, 
                     including albums, the illustrated press, and loose photographs, all related to colonial
                     conflicts between 1880 and 1918.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e341">[5]</a> After treating the image files and annotating associated metadata such 
                     as captions, dates, subjects, and photographers, the team trained a layout-parser
                     CNN to extract images and text from the often unusual page 
                     layouts of the late nineteenth century press. Using the International Image Interoperability
                     Framework (IIIF) format provides a stable 
                     environment in which the image files are permanently linked to their associated textual
                     metadata. After assembling the database, the 
                     project worked on potential methods to use multimodal ML to deliver search results
                     for visual similarity, object detection, and other 
                     aspects of the images in the database. Though we were unable to assess accuracy at
                     scale, our experimental comparisons suggest that adding 
                     natural language processing layers to the network architecture (thereby making it
                     multimodal) might outperform off-the-shelf computer 
                     vision tools available from Google and Amazon, whose models are hampered by various
                     forms of bias in their datasets. Finally, we propose 
                     several ways in which the use of computational tools to facilitate analysis of sensitive
                     historical material might also enable more ethical 
                     approaches to such materials.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">The article's first section introduces issues raised by the digitization of sensitive
                     colonial photography. We outline the history of public 
                     archives and the ideal of open access, which we trace to Enlightenment values according
                     to which governmental authority and actions would be 
                     subordinated to reason and public debate. This same historical period was also bound
                     up with colonialism, plantation economies, and regimes 
                     of forced labor. With digitization campaigns from the 1990s onward, materials from
                     this long colonial period — including images — were 
                     diffused online, raising ethical issues. The early consensus in the archival field
                     that digitization would augment access has been 
                     increasingly tempered by concerns about sensitive material, particularly depictions
                     of violence, offensive or racist terms in digital 
                     metadata, and issues related to privacy and consent. However, we suggest that despite
                     these important ethical issues, choosing 
                     <em class="emph">not</em> to look at these images may lead to overly cautious archival management.

                     associated with ML-assisted approaches to sensitive 
                     digital material. It emphasizes that the visual materials in these archives do not
                     simply depict colonialism; rather, colonial perspectives 
                     are embedded in their material forms and archival organization, the ways they have
                     circulated, and how their visibility was controlled and 
                     limited to certain communities. Though no archive provides direct and unmediated access
                     to the past, choosing to digitize and circulate only 
                     more benign material may create a false and sanitized impression of colonial history.
                     The EyCon project is committed to the idea that 
                     improving access to these materials is essential to writing new histories of colonialism.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p7">While their use raises both practical and ethical problems, ML approaches can reshape
                     the digital colonial archive in ways that enable new 
                     interpretations and engagements with these materials. Digital archives often feature
                     poor metadata shaped by colonial legacies, which 
                     insufficiently contextualize the materials being described and replicate the perspectives
                     of their colonial creators. Manual improvement of 
                     records and metadata is often impossible due to lack of resources. While AI could
                     assist in this respect, for example by automatically 
                     creating or suggesting additional contextualizing metadata, it is far from a panacea.
                     Indeed, the field is rife with a form of technological 
                     fetishism that systematically obscures how human labor is essential to training neural
                     networks. Catherine D'Ignazio and 
                     Lauren Klein have framed this issue using the feminist concept of “invisible labour”, which can 
                     expose the “significant human efforts required by our automated systems” [<a class="ref" href="#dignazio_klein_2020">D'Ignazio and Klein 2020</a>]. 
                     This human involvement means that ML models are inevitably shaped by those who have
                     produced the annotated training sets. Following recent 
                     calls for a more critical integration of AI into archival practice [<a class="ref" href="#colavizza_et_al_2021">Colavizza et al. 2021</a>], we consider ethical issues in the 
                     ML field, such as training dataset bias. Humanities scholars, social scientists, archivists,
                     and computer scientists must actively and 
                     collaboratively address these issues, given the uncritical ways in which many of these
                     tools and methods have been created 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#jo_gebru_2020">Jo and Gebru 2020</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#crawford_paglen_2021">Crawford and Paglen 2021</a>]. At the same time, we argue against the notion that such tools 
                     inevitably do more harm than good.

                     EyCon points toward possibilities for improving on such products, using limited experiments
                     with our database of colonial images. Done 
                     carefully and critically, ML and computer vision tools can help archivists promote
                     access to colonialism's visual records while improving 
                     their contextualization at scale, in part by reshaping how researchers can navigate
                     through this archive. EyCon suggests ways that AI 
                     projects could be built with sensitivity and equity in mind, improving access while
                     enabling more ethical approaches to potentially sensitive 
                     material. This includes involving using “explainable AI techniques” [<a class="ref" href="#bunn_2019">Bunn 2019</a>], multimodal AI for 
                     identification of sensitive material and metadata enrichment, and combining “distant” and “close” readings of archival materials.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p9">Public access to archives has its origins in the Enlightenment period and is further
                     rooted in notions of popular sovereignty. The French 
                     Revolution opened up national archives to all citizens by instituting a 1794 law that
                     created a “central depository for 
                     the national archives”, with free public access [<a class="ref" href="#favier_2004">Favier 2004</a>].
                     <a class="noteRef" href="#d4e423">[6]</a> 
                     To this day, the principle of public access remains a pillar of the Archives Nationales and other archival institutions. In 
                     practice, however, getting access to potentially sensitive information can be extremely
                     complicated. According to the French Heritage Code 
                     (<span class="foreign i">Code du Patrimoine</span>, article L. 213-2), public records should be made accessible twenty-five years after
                     
                     their creation, or fifty years after their creation for documents related to national
                     defense. However, gaining access to sensitive 
                     documents remains complicated when documents have been classified as “secret-defense”. A tension exists between 
                     the Heritage Code (which facilitates access to archives after a certain period of
                     time), and the Penal Code (which prevents the diffusion 
                     of national defense secrets) (<span class="foreign i">Code pénal</span>, article 413-9). Archives that could potentially threaten national 
                     security or embarrass governments can remain locked for a very long time. For example,
                     in a 2021 report, the historian 
                     Benjamin Stora pointed out that many records related to the Algerian war remain inaccessible. Following
                     this report, a decree 
                     passed on 22 December 2021 facilitates access to documents created during the war
                     and its aftermath, between November 1954 and December 
                     1966.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e444">[7]</a>

                     of unlocking previously inaccessible archives. 
                     In the UK, beginning in the early 2000s, the National Archives began creating digitized records from its 
                     microfilm collection [<a class="ref" href="#thompson-baum_2020">Thompson-Baum 2020</a>]. From 2004 to 2007, the Joint Information Systems Committee 
                     (JISC), a UK non-profit organization focusing on digital data and technology, received £22 million
                     from the 
                     Higher Education Funding Council for England for large-scale digitization programs. Commenting on the JISC 
                     initiative, the librarian Jean Sykes wrote that, “Higher and further education communities are going to 
                     benefit from fantastic online resources across a wide range of subjects, gaining access
                     to some of the richest content held in the 
                     UK's great national and university libraries” [<a class="ref" href="#sykes_2008">Sykes 2008</a>]. Google Books, which launched in 2004, started 
                     digitizing millions of books.

                     to which new tools would make knowledge freely 
                     available to a wider public. In the early days of mass digitization, few worried about
                     the possible consequences of releasing huge amounts 
                     of archival materials to the public. The dominant consensus erred on the side of free
                     and open access. In an influential 2005 article 
                     published in <cite class="title italic">American Archivist</cite>, Mark A. Greene and Dennis Meissner pushed archivists 
                     to adopt a new method for processing archival collections. The method of “More Product, Less Process”, or MPLP, 
                     would speed up the cataloging process and transfer the materials quickly into the
                     user's hands. Designed primarily to end the cataloging 
                     backlogs that plagued paper collections, the MPLP method was soon applied to digital
                     collections.

                     originally produced over the course of the colonization 
                     of Algeria. According to Benjamin Stora, the Archives Nationales d’Outre Mer (ANOM) has 
                     digitized more than 600,000 images from colonial Algeria that can be viewed online [<a class="ref" href="#stora_2021">Stora 2021</a>].<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e507">[8]</a> Added to this set are images documenting the civil status of Algeria (717,028

                     images are still being checked, reprocessed, and indexed 
                     ahead of their online publication.

                     these issues have sometimes been difficult to define. 
                     Greene and Meissner (2005) argue that it was invariably better to release data, even when problematic,
                     than to 
                     withhold access. They mention that one processing manual identifies “sensitive subjects as adultery, alcoholism, drug 
                     abuse, homosexuality, lesbianism, mental illness, or suicide” [<a class="ref" href="#stark_2001">Stark 2001</a>], but “several of those 
                     items are not sensitive to every donor or donor's family” [<a class="ref" href="#greene_meissner_2005">Greene and Meissner 2005</a>]. In light of such uncertainty, the 
                     tendency was to release materials, with the option to withhold them if someone complained
                     about sensitivity. The same applied to copyrighted 
                     materials. In the case of periodicals, mass digitization made it impossible — or at
                     least extremely challenging — to identify and obtain 
                     permissions from all copyright holders. Nevertheless, institutions often chose to
                     put digital copies online. For example, the 
                     British Library made accessible selected copies of the feminist magazine <cite class="title italic">Spare Rib</cite> with the 
                     following statement: “We have been unable to locate the copyright holder for these items”. An email address was 
                     provided to allow users to share information they might have about the items [<a class="ref" href="#british-library_2023">British Library 2023</a>]

                  <div class="ptext" id="p14">In the past few years, this open access approach has been criticized on ethical grounds,
                     with a strong emphasis on privacy and consent. Like

                     who wrote poems or essays to be published in print form expected a small audience
                     rather than the huge readership made possible by 
                     digitization. In a 2017 article, Michelle Moravec uses the example of <cite class="title italic">Spare Rib</cite> to encourage other 
                     researchers to ask the following question before using digitized archives: “Have the individuals whose work appears in 
                     these materials consented to this?” Making such documents available on the internet has raised the issue of consent as
                     well as the 
                     ethics of widely releasing sensitive or private materials intended for other uses.

                     colonized people. Temi Odumosu (2020) has 
                     argued for an “ethics of care” toward sensitive digital colonial collections. As an example, Odumosu 
                     uses a photograph depicting a crying child taken by a Danish photographer in St. Croix around 1910. The photograph made its way 
                     into albums of Danish colonials and then into the Royal Danish Library, which digitized it in the mid-2010s. 
                     Odumosu raises ethical concerns about the decontextualized display of this potentially disturbing
                     image and suggests several 
                     avenues toward an ethics of care with regard to colonized subjects captured in visual
                     digital collections. Most interesting for this article 
                     is her proposal that additional contextual metadata could help mediate the emotional
                     dimension of confronting documents created in the 
                     context of colonial domination, particularly by members of source communities. Odumosu suggests that 
                     “digital artefacts of a sensitive and dehumanizing nature are vulnerable without contextualization” and that 
                     richer metadata could demonstrate care and sensitivity toward discomforting images

                     Michael Karabinos, examining the digitization of the Dutch East India Company records, have drawn a
                     distinction between the 
                     “colonial archive” and the “colonized archive” 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#jeurgens_karabinos_2020">Jeurgens and Karabinos 2020</a>]. Whereas the former were “created by former colonial institutions in the era 
                     of colonization”, the latter refer to “records which were originally created, owned and used by local 
                     institutions and people but were collected, looted, bought, or copied and shipped
                     to Europe” [<a class="ref" href="#jeurgens_karabinos_2020">Jeurgens and Karabinos 2020</a>]. 
                     Working within Jeurgens and Karabinos's typology, the EyCon project deals with colonial archives, since the 
                     photographs and other visual documents in the corpus were created and stored by colonial
                     actors, though they often involve colonized people 
                     as subjects. This can imply sensitivity concerns around the depiction of violence
                     against potential ancestors and ancestral communities.

                     Faced with these difficulties, 
                     it can be tempting for archivists to withhold access to sensitive materials. Digitization
                     projects are no longer unchallenged. For example,

                     the colonial archive they risk exacerbating a situation 
                     in which records tend already to be difficult to find and access. If the visual records
                     of modern organized violence during the two world 
                     wars are massively available and searchable, visual material documenting the most
                     unsettling aspects of colonial situations is often less 
                     accessible and less digitized. Some of the most challenging visual records were collected
                     outside institutional networks and remain in the 
                     hand of private collectors. When sensitive materials are made accessible, poor metadata
                     and descriptions shaped by colonial legacies can 
                     provide insufficient contextualization and replicate colonial categories. When it

                     readings of colonial archives, including photographs. The 
                     TRACES (Transmitting Contentious Cultural Heritages with the Arts) project, for example,
                     has explored how to curate exhibitions and events 
                     in close partnership with source communities to mediate contested legacies around
                     issues like the collections of human remains held by 
                     institutions all over Europe. The <cite class="title italic">Dead Images</cite> creative co-production, which is part of TRACES, 
                     has looked at how to use these collections to open up a dialogue about colonial violence
                     and its legacies [<a class="ref" href="#traces_2023">Traces 2023</a>]. 
                     The harmful potential of both documents of colonial domination and their historical
                     metadata is at the very core of digital policies 
                     of projects such as the <cite class="title italic">Digital Benin</cite> initiative, which emphasizes how “catalogue

                     Research projects on Australian Aboriginal photographic archives have also worked
                     on careful recirculation of problematic colonial images

                     the <cite class="title italic">Making African Connections Digital Archive</cite>, for example, have decided to restrict access to the graphic 
                     and nude photographs included in their database. They argue that because the web is
                     “a place where images, objects and 
                     people can easily be displaced from their context and subject to a gaze which has
                     harmful intent”, their “choice

                     the recirculation of images that are ingrained with oppression and violence can sometimes
                     go as far as arguing for a radical expunction of 
                     what should be visible and reproduced. Holger Stoecker, writing on very disturbing colonial photographs of human remains in 
                     German anthropological collections, even advances the idea that images that reflect
                     extreme oppression and power imbalance could actually 
                     be “buried” [<a class="ref" href="#stoecker_2021">Stoecker 2021</a>]. Well-intended approaches to contested visual records are founded on 
                     the notion that the supposed replication of colonial dominance entailed by the digital
                     recirculation should be avoided at all costs.

                     to destabilize established exculpatory narratives. This is exemplified by Jean-Philippe Charbonnier's photographic evidence of 
                     torture on Algerians at the hands of the French army in the late 1950s. These disturbing
                     snapshots documenting a focal point of Algerian and 
                     French histories suffered a long history of willful burial [<a class="ref" href="#riceputi_2020">Riceputi 2020</a>]. To this day, their recirculation is regulated 
                     according to specific guidelines that can become obstacles to their full analysis.

                     about who owns colonial photographs and who can 
                     legitimately write about the histories they document [<a class="ref" href="#peffer_2020">Peffer 2020</a>]. This is a particularly salient issue with visual archives 
                     that are shaped by imperial power dynamics at their point of origin and by layers
                     of archivation that did little to illuminate them. 
                     Colonial oppression is not only depicted in these photographs, but also replicated
                     in how such images were curated, recirculated, and 
                     sometimes willfully put aside to protect those who carried out violence [<a class="ref" href="#pringle_et_al_2022">Pringle et al. 2022</a>]. The siloization and fragmentation of 
                     archives that document colonial oppression favors the “silencing” of unpalatable pasts [<a class="ref" href="#trouillot_1995">Trouillot 1995</a>], as well as

                     its graphical or textual content. Zaagsma 
                     points out that inherited metadata in colonial archives can “impose a distinct view of the past, in this case, that of 
                     the former colonizer” [<a class="ref" href="#zaagsma_2022">Zaagsma 2022</a>]. Other projects working with sensitive material produced during colonial periods
                     
                     have raised this issue. For example, the <cite class="title italic">Making African Connections Digital Archive</cite> refers to the archive as a 
                     “technology of colonialism” [<a class="ref" href="#making-african-connections_2023b">Making African Connections 2023b</a>]. While evaluation of such a 
                     statement involves many considerations (archives are tools of power, but also potentially
                     of self-determination and liberation for groups 
                     that keep their own histories), one cannot dismiss its validity concerning archives
                     created and curated by colonial militaries, which were 
                     shaped by colonial ideologies on multiple levels. For instance, while both photographer
                     and the photographed subject play a role in the 
                     production of photographs, most of the existing metadata is concerned with authorship
                     rather than documentation of the photographed. To 
                     address the invisibilization of colonized people in archives, scholars are now experimenting
                     with a number of digital tools. Toward this 
                     end, several scholars have employed Named Entity Recognition in order to identify
                     individuals who are present in the archive but absent in

                     they chose to keep in the archives and what they chose 
                     to discard, were constrained in different ways. They had material and technical limitations,
                     including that photographic equipment had to be 
                     carried long distances, maintained, and sent back to the metropole for development).
                     Their objectives and those of their institutions shaped 
                     their picture production; some pictures were taken to terrorize enemies or local populations,
                     some were meant to document the everyday life 
                     of colonial soldiers and officials, and still others served as scientific or anthropological
                     data. Many images moved between different uses 
                     depending on how they were deployed and contextualized after their production. These
                     objectives had enormous consequences on the pictures' 
                     content, but this context is mostly lost on contemporary viewers. For example, pictures
                     of racialized people can be viewed as simple 
                     portraits today, while at the time of their creation they served a racist iconographic
                     program, meant to show the supposed morphological 
                     features of various ethnicities or demonstrate evolutionary theories.

                     A deep learning model's sensitivity is a measure of 
                     how well it can detect positive instances, and it is determined by the proportion
                     of actual positive cases to those the model predicts as 
                     positive. Beyond numbers, the emotional sensitivity of any computer vision solution
                     merely mimics human textual annotations fed into the 
                     datasets from which it learns. Critical approaches to datasets and their constitution
                     by human labor are therefore essential for ethical 
                     and effective attempts to create AI for sensitive collections. An “archeology of datasets” that uncovers the 
                     processes through which ML models have been trained thus helps address the opacity
                     of their constitution

                     content, the AI industry often relies on large-scale

                     of labor extraction [<a class="ref" href="#iyer_2022">Iyer 2022</a>]. 
                     A lack of reflexivity on how to apply computer vision to photographic archives that
                     document situations of subjugation could therefore 
                     result in a doubly colonial perspective, in which both the data itself and the production
                     of the tools used to analyze it would be heavily 
                     shaped by power imbalances.

                     to pictures drawn from archives of visual 
                     material, tends to create sets of isolated images that extracts them from their material

                     [<a class="ref" href="#batchen_2004">Batchen 2004</a>], such images make no sense outside of their relation to the body and the hand that

                     limited to the original archival metadata. 
                     Jeurgens and Karabinos argue that the coloniality of recordkeeping systems in the colonial archive cannot
                     and 
                     should not be removed, yet the archives must be decolonized all the same, a dilemma
                     they refer to as the “paradox of

                     their metadata, we risk losing ways to understand the mechanics of this form of oppression.
                     “Not only would it be hiding 
                     the colonial past”, Jeurgens and Karabinos write, but “it would take away the 
                     ability to continue to learn from and about the colonial period, it would be a disservice
                     to those who suffered under colonialism and would 
                     misrepresent both the past and how information was created, stored and accessed” [<a class="ref" href="#jeurgens_karabinos_2020">Jeurgens and Karabinos 2020</a>]. It should 
                     also be noted that most of these documents were meant for very limited circulation:
                     if some of them are propaganda material, the 
                     majority were not intended for public display. Choosing to show these pictures, troubling
                     as they can be, is a way to deconstruct the 
                     culture of secrecy that shaped their original production and mode of circulation.

                     hesitant to create public discourse on these issues by 
                     displaying such photographs. Referring to visual material representing British colonialism,
                     Elizabeth Edwards and Matt 
                     Mead argue that “despite some thirty years of critical museology and a burgeoning theory of photography,
                     these 
                     photographs are seldom made to work hard in public culture”. Evidence of the colonial past in British history 
                     “is remarkable in its absence. Moreover, given the shape and density of the colonial
                     archive, it is a history all the 
                     more remarkable by its photographic invisibility in public space” [<a class="ref" href="#edwards_mead_2013">Edwards and Mead 2013</a>]. While scholarly and public 
                     discussions have advanced considerably since 2013, more work on colonial photography
                     remains to be done. A decision in favor of opacity 
                     would only reproduce colonialism's visual paradigm and post-colonial forgetting.

                     impact on civil society, they exist on an entirely 
                     different scale than global image provider corporations or social media platforms.
                     While we should take steps to ensure that unsuspecting 
                     audiences do not encounter sensitive pictures in databases without warning or context,
                     the scientific ecosystem in which these tools exist

                     parties could scrape sensitive pictures to 
                     redeploy them for other purposes by manipulating their captions or metadata. Precautions
                     should be taken to make these sorts of uses 
                     difficult; the database could restrict mass downloads to logged-in users who have
                     answered questions regarding the purpose of their 
                     demands, and the database could reiterate its usage policies each time someone downloads
                     a picture. Bad actors could still pervert a 
                     database's purpose, but this may be an inherent problem that should be measured against
                     the benefits of the judicious dissemination of 
                     such images. Given that there is a virtually inexhaustible supply of freely available
                     material online that could lend itself to racist 
                     ends, censoring a forum intended for use by researchers would not significantly alter
                     the situation, but could imperil generations of

                     derogatory, or potentially harmful to the 
                     descendants of colonized people” [<a class="ref" href="#eycon_2023">EyCon 2023</a>]. We also explain that such images and terms are not neutral, since 
                     they were produced by actors with a stake in political domination, economic exploitation,
                     and violence. The statement explains EyCon's 
                     argument for reproducing the images with their original metadata in order to facilitate

                     according to Amazon, “in social

                     “inappropriate or offensive content” are clearly based on a legal rather than an ethical perspective, as they 
                     include “Explicit Nudity”, “Suggestive”, “Violence”, 
                     “Visually Disturbing”, “Drugs”, “Alcohol”, and 
                     “Hate Symbols” together with second-level categories that could be of use in a project involving
                     war scenes, 
                     for example, in the “Visually Disturbing” category, “Emaciated Bodies, Corpses, Hanging, 
                     Air Crash, Explosions And Blasts”.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p44">There are numerous problems with using existing off-the-shelf tools on historical
                     materials. First is the question of audience: most 
                     categories are only relevant in certain contexts. For example, a “Suggestive” category would only be appropriate 
                     if your target audience includes children, or if there is a strong moral or religious
                     prescription against this kind of content in your 
                     target audience. In the case of colonial archives, this category could indeed be problematic,
                     as nudity or sexual situations in a colonial 
                     context are often the result of sexual violence or evidence of “primitive” cultures for the authors of the pictures. While AI tools 
                     can help augment our capacity to identify such material, careful expert and source
                     community-led reconstruction of contexts would be 
                     necessary to ensure that the filters are used appropriately.

                     Côte d'Ivoire. In 1898, the French military captured Touré and exiled him to Gabon.

                     crucial here: bias in the database architecture and in 
                     the AI models can only be contested through the involvement of informed and diverse
                     communities [<a class="ref" href="#mckemmish_et_al_2011">McKemmish</a>]. 
                     Involving the potential users of a database of this kind is essential. The EyCon project
                     has organized two workshops to discuss how 
                     archivists currently define and approach “sensitive” pictures. Professionals from various institutions and backgrounds selected 
                     problematic photographs, and the discussions made clear that the restrictive typology
                     used by corporations to classify sensitive content had to be rethought. For this reason,
                     EyCon has been working with team members and paid interns to identify sensitive images.
                     By combining these annotations with already-annotated databases of historical images
                     such as the Valois collection held at   <span class="hi italic">La Bibliothèque de Documentation International Contemporaine</span> (BDIC), we suggest it would be possible to train a CNN to identify instances of sensitive

                     recognition and computer vision within the same

                     burned bodies of several German soldiers inside of a 
                     destroyed tank are barely recognizable (see Figure 5). Working purely through computer

                     cannot recognize them despite information about the corpses in the associated caption.
                     EyCon's experimental approach involved retraining a 
                     visual similarity algorithm using contemporary photos that we degraded in order to
                     make them appear more like historical images. EyCon used 
                     an “error diffusion” algorithm to produce images that appear similar to black and white halftones, which
                     were in turn used to train a 
                     CNN. The team then combined this with vectorization of textual metadata associated
                     with the image. While this method was not attempted at 
                     scale and thus not measured quantitatively, when used on a smaller experimental set
                     of images, this approach was able to detect sensitive 
                     materials in cases when off-the-shelf tools could not, by including their captions
                     when making a determination.

                     and technical differences between historical photos 
                     and contemporary digital images may prevent these tools from accurately identifying
                     and categorizing the images in the archives. The 
                     particular kinds of historical objects in the images are significantly different from
                     the objects in the most common training datasets used 
                     to develop contemporary computer vision tools. Additionally, the appearance of halftone
                     reproductions in historical periodicals and the 
                     lower lens quality of historical photographs in photo albums make them much less distinct
                     that the digital images used in contemporary 
                     training sets. This is why the method of artificially making a set of digital images
                     appear half-toned helped the Eycon model produce 
                     better results, by finding similar instances in cases where off-the-shelf tools did

                     interpret historical photos in part by tracing their circulation in various formats
                     and publications. This can help establish context by 
                     making arguments for probable attributions and by showing how photographs' meanings
                     are inflected by editorial choices such as cropping or 
                     captioning. During the workshop, Schill noted that while the war in Tripoli was highly photographed by newspaper 
                     correspondents at the time, it is little remembered in Europe today. In part, he argued, this is because of the difficulty in 
                     identifying camera operators as well as the diversity of sites and modes of conservation
                     of the photographs. To get a better idea of the 
                     conflict and its visual records, it is necessary to draw links between the various
                     archives holding the records in order to make 
                     attributions and establish context.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p54">The Eycon project's experimental multimodal tool would enable a user to query the
                     database using an image and ask for the ten most similar 
                     images in the database. Alternatively, the user could enter in a query using textual
                     terms and see what photographs are proposed. Finally, 
                     the user could search using an image file and add additional vectors to the search
                     on the basis of text that should be associated with the 
                     image. With more work, such a tool could also make suggestions for additional metadata,
                     adding context to images. For example, if the same 
                     image or a very similar one is attributed to a photographer in one instance but not
                     in the other, the text-processing part of the process 
                     could perceive this attribution and suggest that attribution as a possibility for
                     the other instance of the image. This would make such 
                     records more discoverable and address the fact that this conflict is largely forgotten
                     in the West today, despite the fact that it was 
                     abundantly covered in the press at the time.

                     scholarly tool and a way to show care for sensitive 
                     material. Odumosu, for instance, uncovers various archives and publications in which
                     the “crying child” 
                     photograph appeared, tracing its recirculation [<a class="ref" href="#odumosu_2020">Odumosu 2020</a>]. With ML, this labor could be semi-automated, allowing 
                     scholars to devote precious time and research resources to higher-order mental tasks.
                     In this case, the algorithm's lack of sensitivity 
                     might be an asset, as it would relieve arduous visual labor from human affective systems
                     that would otherwise be forced to deal with many 
                     troubling images. A visual similarity algorithm can recognize where an image appears
                     in other places in the archive and include a hyperlink 
                     to different instances of an image in various national archives. In the case of the
                     seemingly innocuous image of Samory 
                     Touré's exile for example, once the context for such a picture is established, a visual
                     similarity algorithm could identify other 
                     instances of it and flag them for contextualization or potentially sensitive content
                     warnings.

                     China in 1900. This was a trans-imperial conflict in which eight nations joined the imperialist
                     coalition that put down the 
                     uprising. The background of this image shows a Japanese officer.

                     for example, can be viewed from an international or inter-imperial perspective. Various
                     groups described the same events in different 
                     terms: what was defined as a skirmish or revolt in Italy or France could be termed a rebellion, war, or 
                     revolution by other belligerents, as in the Ottoman Empire, in this case. By using tools of linked data such as wikidata and 
                     aligning the metadata around our pictures, we can illustrate such terminological tensions
                     around certain events and create more extensive 
                     records. The main issue is educational: how can we ensure that a database's design
                     and interface does not simply spread and reinforce the 
                     beliefs and values that created the documents it contains? Machine learning could
                     be a means to deconstruct the colonial archive, to show 
                     things that it was not meant to show, to make the conditions of the production of
                     this data visible, and to learn about how colonialism 
                     functions through both the display and concealment of violence. By linking data in
                     different silos and statistically analyzing the 
                     graphical and textual content of these archives, we can draw new connections and enrich

                     of database structures and website designs. Many 
                     online archival databases are manifestations of a twenty-first century “exhibitionary complex” that favors 
                     certain practices of representation and exhibition, specifically when they include
                     AI functionalities [<a class="ref" href="#bennett_1988">Bennett 1988</a>]. They 
                     are performative reflections of early twenty-first century aspirations to ever-increasing
                     searchability, transparency, and access to large 
                     quantities of historical data. Given associated ideas about the photographic medium's
                     transparency, the performance is heightened when 
                     these online repositories exhibit photographs. Even if the notion that photography
                     possesses a special “eye-witness” power and a 
                     distinct potency as a bearer of emotion is a historical and cultural construct with
                     a (mostly) Euro-American genealogy, this idea is now 
                     broadly foundational for twenty-first century global spectatorship. Social media platforms,
                     building on these foundations, creates the 
                     conditions for massive harm because they reinforce popular notions of their contents'
                     transparency. Pictures on Instagram, for instance, 
                     are supposed to be authentic, real, and taken at face value; the platform's simplicity
                     reinforces this perception.

                     time. Such archives should

                     In the 1990s and 2000s, this question was seldom 
                     asked; the notion of open access was largely uncontroversial. While we are now more
                     aware of the dangers of an unchecked open access 
                     movement, we are also confronted with the huge practical and ethical challenges posed
                     by AI. ML models cannot be developed without access 
                     to data. If AI is to help restructure colonial archives, it is essential that humanists,
                     source communities, experts, and computer 
                     engineers cooperate to develop it critically and transparently, with awareness of

                     the production of knowledge and the public discussion of contested legacies. Pursuing
                     this objective involves increasing the visibility of 
                     this visual heritage, but it is not <em class="emph">reducible</em> to it. ML might be better thought of as a tool with which to reorder the 
                     colonial archive's visuality; it can help articulate and organize the archive in ways
                     that exceed the intentions of its original colonial 
                     producers, giving researchers tools with which to build new connections, contexts,
                     and interpretations. Long before digital 
                     computer processing, from the days of filing cabinets and paper indexes, archives
                     have always been tools for accessing traces of the past 
                     in a structured way. Digital developments and AI-reliant tools will not radically
                     disrupt this basic situation. However, the combination of 
                     digitization and machine learning will drastically alter the scale of analysis, the
                     speed at which certain time-consuming archival tasks 
                     can be accomplished, and, ideally, the siloization of archives that contributes to
                     patterns of forgetting. The management of sensitive 
                     content can never and should never be fully automated. However, semi-automation can
                     help augment our capacity to both produce knowledge of 
                     the past using digital visual archives and to approach those archives in ethical ways.

                     material” can cover a broad range of materials and issues, and it is a major concern within
                     archival science. Material may be 
                     considered “sensitive” due to concerns ranging from privacy issues and state secrets to graphic depictions
                     of 
                     violence. More recently, in places such as Canada, Australia, and the United States, the category has 
                     been used extensively with regard to the legal and ethical implications of archival
                     holdings of indigenous artifacts and remains considered 
                     sacred by source communities and nations. In this article, the “sensitive material” to which we refer is largely 
                     visual documentation of colonial violence held in state archives, which can be politically
                     explosive and is important for the process of 
                     confronting the legacies of colonialism. In our usage, “sensitive material” may also refer to racist or 
                     inaccurate metadata dating from the production of these visual materials, which can
                     be disturbing to the contemporary public.</span></div>

                     makes meaning by way of an exact trace (also referred to as the medium's “indexical” nature) has been pursued by many scholars, notably 
                     the art historian Rosalind Krauss [<a class="ref" href="#krauss_1977">Krauss 1977</a>]. The concept of the “index” can be traced to the work of 
                     the American pragmatist philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce and his semiotic triad of icon, symbol, and index. The “index” 
                     establishes meaning by virtue of its physical connection with its referent, as in
                     the way in which footprints are a clue to a pedestrian's
