            <p>Over the last couple of years, it has become increasingly clear that the digital
               humanities is associated with a visionary and forward-looking sentiment, and that the
               field has come to constitute a site for far-reaching discussions about the future of
               the field itself as well as the humanities at large. Based on a rich set of materials
               closely associated with the formation of the digital humanities, this article
               explores the visions and expectations associated with the digital humanities and how
               the digital humanities often becomes a laboratory and means for thinking about the
               state and future of the humanities. It is argued that this forward-looking sentiment
               comes both from inside and outside the field, and is arguably an important reason for
               the attraction and importance of the field. Furthermore, the author outlines a
               visionary scope for the digital humanities and offers a personal visionary statement
               as the endpoint to the article series.</p>

         <div>
            <head>Introduction</head>
            <p>At the end of November 2010, at a contemporary moment when many feel that the
               Humanities are under threat, digital humanities is serving as a means to advocate and
               rethink the Humanities. An example of this is the 4Humanities initiative, whose
               website banner says that the initiative is <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#humanities">Powered by the
                  Digital Humanities Community</quote>
               <ptr target="#humanities"/></cit>. It is not chance that this initiative, like several
               others, starts out from the digital humanities. Over the last couple of years, it has
               become increasingly clear that the digital humanities is associated with a visionary
               and forward-looking sentiment and that the field has come to constitute a site for
               far-reaching discussions about the future of the field itself as well as the
               humanities at large. As will be shown, this forward-looking sentiment comes both from
               inside and outside the field and is arguably an important reason for the attraction
               and importance of the digital humanities. At the same time, its envisioning and
               imaginary power also highlights the coming together of different epistemic traditions
               and an expanding field under negotiation.</p>
            <p>This article explores the visions and expectations associated with the digital
               humanities and how the digital humanities often become a laboratory and means for
               thinking about the state and future of the humanities, as well as how this visionary
               discourse shapes the field and what that tells us about the current state of both the
               field and the humanities. In the final section of this paper, a visionary scope for
               the digital humanities is suggested based on a set of design parameters. While not
               detailing any particular vision, the parameters provide a grounded basis for a
               further discussion. The article concludes with a personal visionary statement about
               the digital humanities.</p>
            <p>This is the final installment in a series of four articles that broadly explores the
               digital humanities in terms of its discursive shift from humanities computing to
               digital humanities, the evolving disciplinary landscape, associated epistemic
               commitments and primary modes of engagement, underlying cyberinfrastructure, visions
               and hopes invested, and possible future directions. Needless to say, this is a large
               undertaking and the result is necessarily patchy and suggestive rather than definite
               and all-inclusive. </p>
            <p>In the first article, I examined the discursive transition from humanities computing
               to digital humanities, analyzing how this naming is related to shifts in
               institutional, disciplinary, and social organization. I also addressed the epistemic
               culture and commitments of humanities computing and tensions between this tradition
               and a broad notion of digital humanities. </p>
            <p>In the second article, I explored the landscape of digital humanities more broadly
               through a critical <soCalled>flythrough</soCalled> of the landscape, an exploration
               of four concrete encounters and an analysis of paradigmatic modes of engagement
               between the humanities and information technology - technology as a tool, study
               object, expressive medium, exploratory laboratory and activist venue.</p>
            <p>In the third article, I discussed cyberinfrastructure for the humanities critically,
               as well as in terms of how new infrastructure and digital humanities spaces can be
               conceptualized, designed and implemented. It was argued that the humanities need to
               consider the multiple opportunities associated with cyberinfrastructure, while
               maintaining epistemic integrity and avoiding the modeling of new infrastructure
               uncritically after existing models. </p>
            <p>While offering perspectives on an exciting and evolving field is important in itself,
               a pertinent driving force behind the article series as a whole is an interest in
               supporting an increased shared awareness across a field broadly conceived of as
               digital humanities, discussing conceptual foundations and sentiments of the digital
               humanities, and engaging with the future of the humanities and higher education.</p>

               <head> Outline </head>
               <p>This article is divided into three parts. The first part provides a background and
                  critical framing through suggesting reasons for the visionary sentiment of digital
                  humanities, discussing distinct examples of the visionary discourse associated
                  with the field, and looking at how visions vary with different epistemic
                  commitments. Additionally, the role of junior digital humanists in these visions
                  is discussed, as well as how digital humanities is related to technology and
                  transformative discourse more generally.</p>
               <p>The second part looks at a selection of texts from the digital humanities with a
                  pronounced forward-looking sentiment: the Digital Humanities Manifesto 2.0, the
                  2006 American Council of Learned Societies Report on <title rend="quotes">Our
                     Common Commonwealth,</title> the website of the Institute for Computing in
                  Humanities, Arts, and Social Science, and Melissa Terras’s plenary lecture at the
                  conference Digital Humanities 2010. These materials are discussed critically, and
                  particular concern is given to the way that overarching visions are grounded in
                  intermediate level topics and concerns such as reward systems, interdisciplinary
                  practice and accessibility of digital cultural heritage. </p>
               <p>The third part discusses a tentative visionary scope for the digital humanities
                  based on a series of design parameters such as mutual respect, engagement with
                  technology, and disciplinary grounding. Crucially, it is not suggested that there
                  is one definite vision or set of strategies. Rather, through drawing on personal
                  experience and the article series as a whole, a strategic pathway and visionary
                  sentiment is offered. The article ends with a personal outlook and vision
                  statement based on the visionary scope established in the article.</p>

            <head>Part I: The Visionary Discourse of the Digital Humanities</head>
            <div>
               <head>Why Visionary?</head>
               <p>Unlike many other fields and constellations in the humanities, the digital
                  humanities is intimately associated with a fairly pronounced and far-reaching
                  visionary discourse and transformative sentiment. There is no simple explanation
                  for this visionary engagement and, given the nature and variation of the field
                  (Svensson 2010), no one uniform vision. However, we can provisionally identify a
                  set of reasons and a broader context.</p>
               <p>Firstly, despite its fairly long history, the institutional status of digital
                  humanities is unclear and undecided, which prompts thinking about the future of
                  the field. As Geoffrey Rockwell noted nearly ten years ago (Rockwell 2002), the
                  community was already then getting tired of discussing whether humanities
                  computing is a discipline or an interdisciplinary field. This situation has not
                  been resolved, and if anything, it has become more multi-layered and complex. It
                  is true that there are more disciplinary structures for the digital humanities now
                  (departments, centers, funding schemes and educational programs) but also more
                  variation across the landscape (Svensson 2010), more concern about inclusion and
                  exclusion (cf. Sinclair 2010, Trettien 2010, Ramsay 2011), an ongoing discussion
                  of the status of digital humanities deeply rooted in different visions and models
                  (cf. Rockwell 2010), and still rather few educational programs that allow <cit>
                     <quote rend="inline" source="#rockwell2002">control of its means of reproduction</quote>
                     <ptr target="#rockwell2002"/>
                  </cit>. </p>
               <p>While the strength and scope of the visions may be particular to the digital
                  humanities, most of the features just listed can also be found in other fields. A
                  useful example is Asian American Studies, which began proper in the late 1980s and
                  whose establishment as a field shows many parallels to the digital humanities.
                  Indeed, Chan’s presentation of the achievements of Asian American Studies (Chan
                  2010:478) – including more faculty positions, book series by academic publishers,
                  hundreds of people presenting at annual meetings of the association – is
                  reminiscent of those of digital humanities. She is also concerned with the
                  relative absence of graduate programs, problems with disciplinary alignment and
                  not everything being <soCalled>fixed</soCalled>:</p>
               <cit>
                  <quote rend="block" source="#chan2010">However, even though these developments seem to indicate that
                     the field has finally <soCalled>arrived,</soCalled> we cannot rest on our
                     laurels. Despite our new visibility and vigor, we continue to exist on
                     contested terrain. And the contestation today is not only between us and the
                     university but also among ourselves.</quote>
                  <ptr target="#chan2010" loc="478"/>
               </cit>
               <p>The digital humanities is a larger enterprise than five or six years ago, and this
                  expansion has made the field considerably more heterogeneous. Chan discusses the
                  political and community grounding of Asian American studies and how the field is
                  contemporarily divided as to whether this is a primary or relevant commitment. The
                  digital humanities also has a set of embedded core values – including a
                  predominantly textual orientation and a focus on technology as tool (Svensson
                  2009) – some of which are challenged or diluted through an expanded notion of the
                  field. This should not be unnecessarily construed as a problem, but it adds to the
                  sense of a field in a dynamic state.</p>
               <p>Another useful and related comparison is the emergence of Area Studies in the late
                  1940s. Rafael (1994) discusses Robert Hall’s report on Area Studies from 1947 and
                  points to how early interest in the field came from a strong sense of
                  dissatisfaction with current research approaches and methods and with the
                  specialization and isolation of traditional disciplines. This discourse can
                  similarly be found in the contemporary discussion of digital humanities where
                  dissatisfaction with existing structures is seen as a critical driving force (cf.
                  Terras 2010).</p>
               <p>One way for area studies to make a difference and to remedy some of the problems
                  identified was to give the field a clear agentive role:</p>
               <cit>
                  <quote rend="block" source="#rafael1994">Area studies were thus charged with a mediating function,
                        <q>nourishing</q> the disciplines as to bring them in
                     better touch with the <soCalled>real world.</soCalled>

                  <ptr target="#rafael1994" loc="95"/>
               </cit>
               <p>The view of Area Studies as energizing, connecting and developing the traditional
                  disciplines corresponds to at least some ideas about the digital humanities. Hall
                  advocates an in-between position for Area Studies, where the disciplines are quite
                  important, and he also talks about <cit>
                     <quote rend="inline" source="#rafael1994">dual citizenship</quote>
                     <ptr target="#rafael1994" loc="95"/>
                  </cit> as a strategy to bring Area Studies and the disciplines together.</p>
               <cit>
                  <quote rend="block" source="#rafael1994">In maintaining disciplinary distinctions, area studies thus
                     also retained for themselves a relation of dependency to such
                     disciplines.</quote>
                  <ptr target="#rafael1994" loc="95"/>
               </cit>
               <p>The question of dependency is critical to the digital humanities too, and one that
                  often surfaces in the discussion of the field. One concern is the relation to
                  established disciplines and existing academic structures, which together with
                  uncertainty about the scope and direction of the field contribute to a sense of
                  unstable boundaries.</p>
               <p>There is clear evidence that the terrain of digital humanities is not stable nor
                  fixed. An example would be the institutional status of the field. At the time of
                  writing, King’s College is planning to create the Department of Digital Humanities
                  from the successful and long-standing Center for Computing in the Humanities. At
                  roughly the same time, Rockwell comments that <cit>
                     <quote rend="inline" source="#rockwell2010">I am no longer confident that we want to take the route of
                        forming a discipline with all its attendant institutions.</quote>
                     <ptr target="#rockwell2010"/>
                  </cit> Moreover, the Digital Humanities Manifesto 2.0 announces that the Digital
                  Humanities <cit>
                     <quote rend="inline" source="#manifesto2009">is not a unified field but an array of convergent

                     <ptr target="#manifesto2009"/>
                  </cit> This somewhat indeterminate position (cf. e.g. <ptr target="#sample2010a"/>, <ptr target="#scheinfeldt2010"/>) is coupled with a strong and expanded
                  interest in the digital humanities. All in all, this leads to the formulation of
                  strategies and visions as existing academic institutions, scholarly associations
                  and other actors (including some funding agencies) are engaging with (and
                  arguably, territorializing) the digital humanities. Most such forward-looking
                  statements will naturally be visionary and hopeful rather than static and dismal,
                  as the following whitepaper for a new proposed center exemplifies:</p>
               <cit>
                  <quote rend="block" source="#tamu">We propose the creation of a Center for Digital Humanities,
                     Media and Culture (formerly titled Texas Center for Digital Humanities and New
                     Media). The Center will address two related grand challenges: the need to
                     investigate the relationship of computing technologies and culture, and the
                     need to construct cyberinfrastructure for the humanities and social sciences.
                     The Center’s research, focused in four interrelated areas — the cultural
                     record, cultural systems, cultural environments, and cultural interactions in
                     the digital age – engages one of the most compelling questions of our time:
                     What does it mean to be human in the digital age?</quote>
                  <ptr target="#tamu"/>
               </cit>
               <p>It is simply hard to secure strategic traction if you do not clearly point to
                  possibilities, development and substantial impact. It is noteworthy, though, that
                  many digital humanities materials, such as the above whitepaper, hardly point to
                  any weaknesses or threats, at least not in a more structured manner. </p>
               <p>Another important factor is that the digital humanities, at least potentially,
                  operates across all of the humanities. Under a broadly conceived digital
                  humanities, there is a range of possible interaction points between the
                     <soCalled>digital</soCalled> and the individual disciplines. A critical
                  underlying actuality is that information technology provides powerful tools for
                  the humanities and that the <soCalled>digital</soCalled> is an integral part of
                  our culture, an actuality that affects all the humanities disciplines on a
                  fundamental level (cf. <ptr target="#svensson2009"/>). On the other hand, we also
                  need to be aware that digital humanities as a field has been much more associated
                  with certain disciplines and perspectives than others. Incidentally, this is also
                  where we see different levels of visionary leverage depending on the epistemic
                  commitments and the modes of engagement recruited by a given digital humanities
                  initiative. An initiative invested in tools for humanities research would make
                  different claims than one invested in studying the effects of the digital on
                  contemporary life and culture. Still, regardless of the variety of digital
                  humanities, there is often an actual or presumed engagement with all or most of
                  the humanities. This gives the digital humanities more reach than most regular
                  departments, disciplines and centers, and arguably, both an interest and a mandate
                  to be invested in the future of the humanities at large (somewhat like humanities
                  centers). The fact that the field tends to be institutionalized differently than
                  other academic enterprises might also help in the sense that it facilitates a
                  freer role and possibly a less competitive stance in relation to established
                  departments and disciplines. </p>
               <p>Additionally, there is humanities-wide leverage on the funding agency level
                  through organizations such as the National Endowment of Humanities (NEH) Office of
                  Digital Humanities in the US. Such offices or functions at the funding agency
                  level can assume an intermediary, bridge-building role within the larger funding
                  agency structures and can thus strengthen the humanities wide reach of the digital
                  humanities. An illustrative example is the Digging into Data Challenge (DiD),
                  which is supported by eight international research organizations in four countries
                  including NEH:</p>
               <cit>
                  <quote rend="block" source="#digging2011">The DiD Challenge is an open competition, soliciting
                     applications from researchers in the information, library, archival, and
                     computational sciences as well as the humanities and the social sciences. A
                     successful application is likely to be one which addresses the goals of the DiD
                     initiative (innovative research applied to large scale datasets, effective
                     interdisciplinary collaboration, and improving access to and sharing of data
                     for work in the humanities and/or social sciences).</quote>
                  <ptr target="#digging2011"/>
               </cit>
               <p>The DiD Challenge is based on access to large data sets, a strong focus on
                  team-based work and international collaboration. It is significant that in the US,
                  NEH collaborates with the National Science Foundation (NSF) as well as the
                  Institute of Museum and Library Services. Also, it seems likely that this would
                  help create awareness and interest for the field outside the humanities proper.
                  From the point of view of researchers and the community, such collaboration
                  probably generates additional resources and leverage. Additionally, while the DiD
                  initiative is also clearly aligned with a <soCalled>big data</soCalled> and
                  infrastructure paradigm and would necessarily be excluding, the call seems
                  reasonably open. It puts some emphasis on research and includes digitalized
                  cultural heritage material as well as born-digital data. Furthermore, the call is
                  fairly clear about the deliberations, parameters and constraints at play.</p>
               <p>Indeed, research infrastructure has cross-sectional potential, and there is often
                  at least nominal interest in including in the humanities in new research
                  infrastructure initiatives (<ptr target="#svensson2011"/>). Here the digital
                  humanities matches the expectations more than in most other areas. This may lead
                  to the digital humanities representing the humanities in relation to other areas
                  of research and development such as science and engineering, which in turn helps
                  create interest for the field outside of the humanities and contributes to the
                  sense of digital humanities as representing or manifesting the humanities. </p>
               <p>In a sense, the digital humanities can thus come to serve as a relatively
                     <soCalled>understandable</soCalled> and interpretable part of the humanities
                  through its perceived or projected engagement with technology, often large data
                  sets, laboratory environments, etc. The magnitude of the research challenges in
                  terms of complexity, potential impact, resources required and a need to engage
                  interdisciplinary teams is sometimes compared to those of science and engineering
                  through invoking the frame of <soCalled>grand challenges</soCalled> or
                     <soCalled>big humanities</soCalled> (for examples, see Davidson 2008:714, Weber
                  2005 and Manovich, interviewed in Franklin and Rodriguez'G. 2008). The
                  interdisciplinary aspect of digital humanities tends to be foregrounded in these
                  contexts:</p>
               <cit>
                  <quote rend="block" source="#presner2009a">Because Digital Humanities engenders truly interdisciplinary
                     work with a potentially global impact, granting agencies now recognize that the
                     Humanities, like other disciplines, have entered the age of the grand
                     challenge.</quote>
                  <ptr target="#presner2009a" loc="7"/>
               </cit>
               <p>While the ideas of grand challenges and big humanities certainly have attraction
                  and require essential forward thinking in order to identify complex problems and
                  large-scale visions, we should be careful not to uncritically accept the frame of
                  big humanities, which, for instance, has a tendency to be coupled with a
                  positivist agenda and a homogenization of the humanities (cf. <ptr target="#scout2006"/>). </p>
               <p>There is a strong link between visionary discourse and technology, historically
                  and contemporarily (see e.g. <ptr target="#turner2006"/>), and the digital
                  humanities clearly have a strong investment in technology, technological
                  infrastructure, and the digital more generally. An obvious example would be
                  visions that draw directly on existing or future technological innovation. In the
                  tool-based digital humanities tradition, technologically induced visions or
                  projections are fairly common, but they often seem to be comparatively low-key and
                  linked to particular areas or concrete challenges. There is also a more general
                  visionary strand that can either be associated with a specific set of technologies
                  such as high-performance computing or with cyberinfrastructure more generally. The
                  sentiment from the NSF Blue Ribbon Report on Cyberinfrastructure, <cit>
                     <quote rend="inline" source="#atkins2003">a new age has dawned in scientific and engineering
                        research, pushed by continuing process in computing information, and

                     <ptr target="#atkins2003" loc="31"/>
                  </cit> can be traced in the digital humanities too. Similarly, there is often an
                  accompanying sense of urgency (see e.g. <ptr target="#unsworth2006" loc="32"/>). </p>
               <p>Importantly, there is a sense that doing digital humanities work requires pushing
                  on established traditions and structures. This is probably one of the principal
                  reasons people interested in thinking about and reconfiguring the humanities are
                  attracted to the field. The title of a recent book project, <title rend="italic">Hacking the Academy</title>, is symptomatic, and while the following
                  description of it may be somewhat forceful, the general sentiment is quite
                  common.</p>
               <cit>
                  <quote rend="block" source="#cohen2010">But today serious scholars are asking whether the institutions
                     of the academy as they have existed for decades, even centuries, aren’t
                     becoming obsolete. Every aspect of scholarly infrastructure is being
                     questioned, and even more importantly, being
                     &lt;em&gt;hacked&lt;/em&gt;.</quote>
                  <ptr target="#cohen2010"/>
               </cit>
               <p>From this point of view, the need for visions and encouraging rethinking of
                  established structures seems quite apparent. The tension between the digital
                  humanities and the academic establishment is multifaceted. For instance, the field
                  is normally seen as an interdisciplinary venture whereas most universities
                  primarily support disciplinary work. This tension has practical implications. For
                  example, running courses with lecturers from different departments may be
                  administratively difficult (cf. <ptr target="#svensson2010" loc="§79"/>).
                  Moreover, much digital humanities work is collaborative and project based, and
                  such processes and deliverables (including different kinds of digital
                  publications) may not have a clear place in the reward and support systems of the
                  academy (cf. <ptr target="#ippolito2009"/>, <ptr target="#fitzpatrick2009"/>).
                  Nor may there be physical space or distributed collaborative functions for this
                  type of teamwork. The collaborative nature of much digital humanities work is an
                  important factor as well as a changing <soCalled>ecology</soCalled> of scholarly
                  work and the blurring of processes such as research and publishing (<ptr target="#price2011"/>, <ptr target="#earhart2011"/>, <ptr target="#fitzpatrick2009"/>). For more individual research projects with
                  traditional scholarly output, what is studied may be seen as peripheral to the
                  discipline in question and specific needs in terms of engagement with technology
                  and interdisciplinary connections may cause tension with the epistemic commitments
                  of the discipline. There is also more generally a great deal of concern about
                  tenure systems and career paths among faculty or non-faculty positions, as well as
                  among digital humanities experts and other staff (cf. <ptr target="#terras2010"/>,
                     <ptr target="#kirschenbaum2010a"/>, <ptr target="#fitzpatrick2009"/>).
                  Furthermore, some digital humanities work requires extensive technology
                  infrastructures, which is not very common in the humanities. Based on these and
                  other factors, there is a strong sense that the university and the humanities need
                  to change to accommodate this type of work, and all this feeds into a vision of a
                  transformed humanities.</p>
               <p>On a more overarching level, there is a strong visionary and transformative
                  sentiment that goes beyond the intermediate-level issues discussed above. This is
                  where we find grand, sweeping statements and a fair deal of discursive intensity.
                  David Perry illustrates this sentiment when he says <cit>
                     <quote rend="inline" source="#parry2010">I don’t want a digital facelift for the humanities, I want
                        the digital to completely change what it means to be a humanities
                        scholar</quote>
                     <ptr target="#parry2010"/>
                  </cit>. This discourse would seem not only to be grounded in the issues discussed
                  above (coming from the practical work of the digital humanities), but also in more
                  general discontent with the state of affairs for the humanities, the academe and,
                  to some extent, society. </p>
               <p>There are several intertwined threads that play into this. There is a
                  long-standing sense that the humanities (and liberal arts education) are fighting
                  a losing battle for funding, recognition and a civic role (e.g. <ptr target="#nussbaum2010"/>, <ptr target="#donoghue2008"/>). This sentiment ties
                  in with a concern about the situation of higher education more generally – not
                  least in financially dire times and in countries such as the United States and
                  United Kingdom and can also be seen in the frustration and discontent expressed,
                  not least, from younger faculty and graduate students about the perceived lack of
                  future possibilities, resistance to new ideas, and sometimes, a perceived inward
                  sentiment of the humanities.</p>
               <p>The digital humanities can thus become a platform or means for rethinking the
                  humanities and higher education and a way of channeling transformative sentiment
                  that often goes far beyond the digital humanities proper. This is an important and
                  complex function necessary to understanding the digital humanities, and one we
                  will continue to explore.</p>

               <p>Two blog posts about the digital humanities in the beginning of 2010 stimulated a
                  fair amount of discussion among digital humanists and others. On January 6, David
                  Perry posted an entry where he, among other things, said:</p>
               <cit>
                  <quote rend="block" source="#parry2010">I don’t want a digital facelift for the humanities, I want the
                     digital to completely change what it means to be a humanities scholar. When
                     this happens then I’ll start arguing that the digital humanities have arrived.
                     Really I couldn’t care less about text visualizations or neat programs which
                     analyze the occurrences of the word <q>house</q> in Emily
                     Dickinson’s poetry. If that is your scholarship fine, but it strikes me that
                     that is just doing the same thing with new tools.</quote>
                  <ptr target="#parry2010"/>
               </cit>
               <p>Perry’s statement demonstrates an underlying desire to fundamentally change the
                  humanities, which goes beyond creating digital tools or analyzing new strata of
                  study objects. His post resulted in fairly heated discussion on the blog, on
                  Twitter and over other channels. One point of tension, naturally, is the above
                  evaluation of traditional text and tool based digital humanities, which would seem
                  to refer to traditional humanities computing. In a blog comment in relation to
                  this entry, Steven Ramsay points to the significance of the techne of scholarship
                  and how a technology such as printing press cannot just be seen as a faster
                  version of the scriptorium. The argument is that tools of this kind facilitate new
                  kinds of intellectualism. He puts forward concordance software and corpora as
                  another example:</p>
               <cit>
                  <quote rend="block" source="#ramsay2010">I can now search for the word <q>house</q> (maybe <q>domus</q>) in every work ever
                     produced in Europe during the entire period in question (in seconds). To
                     suggest that this is just the same old thing with new tools, or that
                     scholarship based on corpora of a size unimaginable to any previous generation
                     in history is just <q>a fascination with gadgets,</q> is
                     to miss both the epochal nature of what’s afoot, and the ways in which
                     technology and discourse are intertwined.</quote>
                  <ptr target="#ramsay2010"/>
               </cit>
               <p>Ramsay uses the size of (some) present-day corpora to support his argument, and
                  reference to numbers, size and computational speed is quite common in this kind of
                  discourse (cf. <ptr target="#svensson2011"/>). The exchange above accentuates the
                  epistemic tension between a tradition invested in technology as tool and large
                  data sets and one invested in changing the humanities. </p>
               <p>Three days after Perry’s blog entry, Ian Bogost blogged about the status of the
                  humanities in a fairly provocative way. Here is an excerpt:</p>
               <cit>
                  <quote rend="block" source="#bogost2010">If there is one reason things "digital" might release humanism

                     studies, scandals, magnetic disks, rugby players, dereferenced pointers,
                     cardboard void fill, pro-lifers, snowstorms. [...] If we want the humanities to
                     become central, it is not the humanities that must change, but its members. We
                     must want to be of the world, rather hidden from it. We must be brutal. We must
                     invoke wrath instead of liberation. We must cull. We must burn away the dead
                     wood to let new growth flourish. If we don't, we will suffocate under the
                     noxious rot of our own decay.</quote>

               <p>Bogost points to the opening up of the humanities to the outside world partly as a
                  consequence of the digital and the need for the members of the humanities to
                  change (rather than the humanities itself). In just a few days, 34 blog comments
                  were posted to Bogost’s original post, and much discussion was generated over
                  twitter. Again, in these comments we can see examples of tension between different
                  flavors of digital humanities. In a particularly forthright comment, Lisa Nakamura
                  says that, </p>

                  <quote rend="block" source="#nakamura2010">
                     <soCalled>digital humanities</soCalled> boils down to using computers to do
                     exactly the same silo-ed and intellectually buttoned down work that people did
                     before. It is the opposite of expansive. But it's always easier to get money
                     for equipment (i.e. computers to make a million concordances of literature that
                     people don't even read anymore and sure as hell don't want to read lit-crit
                     about) than it is to re-envision a field. People in this kind of digital
                     humanities are very concerned with "preservation" in every sense of the word —
                     preservation of the status quo, of themselves and their jobs, and of the
                     methods and fields of the past. </quote>
                  <ptr target="#nakamura2010"/>
               </cit>
               <p>Interestingly, Nakamura directly challenges traditional humanities computing or
                  digital humanities (note the quotation marks) for not doing re-envisioning work
                  and being technocentric, and firmly categorizing this tradition, or set of
                  traditions, as facilitating preservation at same time as she expresses clear
                  discontent with some of the traditional humanities. Again this reflects different
                  sets of epistemic commitments. Importantly, Nakamura’s own discipline, media
                  studies (and more broadly, cultural studies), does not have a tradition of
                  considerable engagement with technology beyond regular academic use (cf. McPherson
                  2009). In media studies, technology and the digital tend to be objects of
                  analysis. Also, cultural studies have an engagement with the
                     <soCalled>everyday</soCalled> and hence everyday technology as opposed to
                  specialized technology and scholarly tools (cf. <ptr target="#nakamura2006"/>).
                  Nakamura’s critique can be read as a positioning of media studies (and cultural
                  studies) in relation to traditional humanities computing (as digital humanities),
                  which is often enacted by comparative literature and English (<ptr target="#kirschenbaum2010a"/>), and as part of the ongoing territorialization
                  of the <soCalled>digital.</soCalled> In doing so, she indirectly supports an
                  expansive and re-envisioning digital humanities, and the view of digital
                  humanities as an arena for rethinking the humanities. </p>
               <p>While the context of these blog entries and associated comments is polemic and
                  intense (cf. <ptr target="#unsworth2010"/>) and analytical caution should be
                  exercised, it is also true that this type of discourse shows us some of the
                     <soCalled>cracks</soCalled> and points of tension in the disciplinary texture.
                  For instance, as we have seen, there are tensions between a technologically
                  anchored and tool based approach and a cultural or media studies oriented
                  approach, where the digital is primarily an object of analysis rather than a
                  tool.</p>
               <p>It is fairly obvious that both Perry and Bogost use the digital and the digital
                  humanities as a means to discuss the state of the humanities more generally. This
                  position is even clearer in a HASTAC forum comment by Mark Sample:</p>
               <cit>
                  <quote rend="block" source="#sample2010b">The digital humanities should not be about the digital at all.
                     It’s all about innovation and disruption. The digital humanities is really an

               <p>While the above positions may be seen as particularly forceful, there are many
                  less extreme discursive examples that build on a certain degree of unhappiness
                  with the current state and place of the humanities, suggesting the digital as a
                  possible means of changing these dynamics and trajectory, including this
                  statement:</p>
               <cit>
                  <quote rend="block" source="#simpson">As a collective autobiography of mankind, the humanities —
                     history, literature, art, and philosophy — have historically played a leading
                     civic role in society. But in recent decades, the academy’s civic role has
                     weakened: higher education increasingly has been seen as a private rather than
                     a public good. The Simpson Center for the Humanities at the University of
                     Washington seeks to reverse this trend by taking humanities scholarship public
                     with the new digital technologies.</quote>
                  <ptr target="#simpson"/>
               </cit>
               <p>The quote above is from a printed presentation, mainly to potential funders, of a
                  digital humanities initiative at a humanities center, emphasizing one particular
                  quality of the technology - the ability of digital technologies to leverage the
                  humanities as a public project (see <ptr target="#woodward2009"/> for a
                  description of the conceptual grounding of public humanities). On this more
                  particular level, we find that the digital humanities is often discussed in
                  relation to specific critical topics that arise from the perceived tension between
                  digital humanities and traditional structures and values in the humanities or the
                  academy more generally. Examples include outreach and public engagement, reward
                  structures, digital publication, preserving digital research output as part of the
                  scholarly record for the field, interdisciplinary work practice, project based
                  work, infrastructural needs and institutional support. </p>
               <p>These topics clearly relate both to visions of the digital humanities and to the
                  rethinking and envisioning of the humanities more generally. An important
                  observation is that neither the overarching visionary sentiment, nor most specific
                  topics typically describe major research challenges for the humanities. Rather the
                  focus tends to be on the transformation of the humanities and various issues to do
                  with methodology, digitalization, materials and data, sustainability and
                  constraints in the academic system. Even big humanities, as outlined in documents
                  such as the Digital Humanities Manifesto 2.0, is more methodological in nature
                  than focused on core scholarly issues. </p>

               <p>Clearly, not all of the digital humanities engages equally in the type of
                  transformative discourse discussed above. For instance, it would seem that
                  traditional humanities computing typically does not see itself as a primary agent
                  for the large-scale change of the humanities. It is also noteworthy that
                  humanities computing has not had a large investment in the cyberlibertarian side
                  of computing and the early net from the 1970s and 1980s and onwards (<ptr target="#liu2004" loc="240–241"/>), an investment that is much more prevalent
                  in new media studies, digital media studies, internet studies, etc. (cf. <ptr target="#silver2006"/>). This does not mean that humanities computing cannot be
                  (and be perceived as) a transformative practice but rather that the language and
                  the epistemic stakes are quite different. </p>
               <p>Wikipedia defines digital humanities in the following way: </p>
               <cit>
                  <quote rend="block" source="#wikipedia">The digital humanities, also known as humanities computing, is
                     a field of study, research, teaching, and invention concerned with the
                     intersection of computing and the disciplines of the humanities. It is
                     methodological by nature and interdisciplinary in scope. It involves
                     investigation, analysis, synthesis and presentation of information in
                     electronic form. It studies how these media affect the disciplines in which
                     they are used, and what these disciplines have to contribute to our knowledge
                     of computing.<note>Interestingly, the beginning of the entry was updated on
                        October 31, 2010 to include a “sometimes”: The digital humanities, sometimes
                        also known as…”.This demonstrates a sensitivity to some of the issues at

               <p>Wikipedia basically employs a humanities computing definition,<note>The Wikipedia
                     entry is linked to by the Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations (AHDO)
                     from the main ADHO entry webpage. A simple wiki dashboard analysis shows that
                     many of the edits have been carried out by scholars from the humanities
                     computing community. Accessed on July 10, 2010. <ref target="http://digitalhumanities.org/">http://digitalhumanities.org/</ref>.</note> and although humanities computing
                  as a project extends across disciplines, descriptions such as the above often give
                  a sense of disciplinary and communitarian sentiment. Humanities computing is thus
                  presented as a fairly well established part of an existing institutional
                  structure, arguably a projection in its own right, rather than a transformational
                  force. There is also a tendency to have an inward focus on the community and the
                  field rather than on systemic and outward change of larger structures. This was
                  evident, for instance, in Melissa Terras’ plenary talk at the Digital Humanities
                  2010 conference (<ptr target="#terras2010"/>). When these articulated visions are
                  found, they tend to focus on methodology or making cultural heritage accessible
                  rather than overhauling the humanities. The dream of making our cultural heritage
                  available to everyone is strongly articulated in the ACLS Report on
                  Cyberinfrastructure:</p>

                     and practices – within the reach of every citizen. The value of building an
                     infrastructure that gives all citizens access to the human record and the
                     opportunity to participate in its creation and use is enormous, exceeding even

               <p>No doubt this is a most substantial, and in fact practically unattainable,
                  challenge and vision, and while it is does not promise to change academia, it
                  certainly points at large-scale societal and cultural changes, although these
                  changes are not really presented in detail. On one level, this vision could be
                  seen as the ultimate goal for a digital humanities focused on archives and
                  digitalization.</p>
               <p>In the following citation from the introduction of the <title rend="italic">Companion to Digital Humanities</title>, there is another kind of emphasis.
                  Here, technology-induced method is emphasized, and there is a sense of strongly
                  pushing the boundaries for humanities scholarship:</p>

                     scholars, outside of philosophy, have ever been required to do. This method, or
                     perhaps we should call it a heuristic, discovers a new horizon for humanities
                     scholarship, a paradigm as powerful as any that has arisen in any humanities
                     discipline in the past – and, indeed, maybe more powerful, because the rigor it
                     requires will bring to our attention undocumented features of our own ideation.
                     Coupled with enormous storage capacity and computational power, this heuristic

               <p>In terms of concrete issues, humanities computing has had a long-standing interest
                  in many of the critical issues listed earlier including reward structures,
                  team-based research, digital publication and interdisciplinary work. However,
                  there is a basic difference in the way these issues are framed and leveraged in
                  relation to the basic epistemic commitments of different traditions. Looking at
                  the landscape of the digital humanities more broadly, it seems tenable to assume
                  that the most far-reaching employment of the digital as a means of (re)negotiating
                  the humanities does not come from humanities computing with its primary
                  instrumental orientation, nor from internet studies and many other cultural
                  studies approaches to the digital with their primary interest in the digital as an
                  object of analysis (and a stronger disciplinary anchoring). Rather, it seems that
                  approaches and initiatives invested in several modes of engagement between the
                  digital and the humanities are more likely to relate to the place and future of
                  the humanities. This is particularly true if there is an institutional and
                  policymaking level to these initiatives. HASTAC is a good example of such an
                  initiative. It is no accident that several of the initiators of HASTAC have strong
                  institutional positions in humanities centers, or that HASTAC has a focus on
                  change: </p>

               <p>The model here seems to be that junior scholars can be helped by senior scholars
                  through example, probably both to see what is possible and to get authentication
                  for such activities and modes. There are two underlying assumptions here: firstly
                  that junior scholars actually want new or different ways of doing things and
                  secondly, given such a wish, that they would be interested in senior faculty
                  showing the way. These assumptions may be fairly reasonable and certainly
                  well-meaning, but it can be argued that there is a risk to
                     <soCalled>construct</soCalled> a generation of young humanities scholars eager
                  to engage with <q>new/different ways of doing things</q> and
                  in need of help to engage with such practice from e.g. senior scholars, reformed
                  reward systems, etc. Arguably, such junior scholars are construed as the subjects
                  of particular transformative visions of the (digital) humanities. This can be
                  contrasted with the findings of a University of California Report on <title rend="quotes">Faculty Attitudes and Behaviors regarding Scholarly
                     Communication</title>
                  <ptr target="#ucosc2007" loc="5"/> that suggest that junior scholars can be fairly
                  conservative (partly as a result of tenure criteria) while senior scholars may be
                  more amenable to change.</p>
               <p>While a great deal of hope is assigned to the new generation of digital humanists,
                  there is also concern with a lack of career paths and professional opportunities.
                  Such concerns reflect particular issues in different types of digital humanities.
                  For instance, humanities computing has a long history of tension in terms of
                  establishing academic job opportunities and career paths, which is partly related
                  to an often institutionally peripheral position, a different professional
                  structure than most disciplines (including heaver reliance on skills and practices
                  not typical of traditional humanities scholarship) and no clear way to a tenure
                  track or equivalent position nor a highly qualified expert role.</p>
               <cit>
                  <quote rend="block" source="#terras2010">This is becoming a real issue in Digital Humanities. There is
                     no clear route to an academic job, and no clear route to PhD, and there are a
                     lot of people at a high level in the field who do not have PhDs. Yet
                     increasingly, we expect the younger intake to have gone down that route, and
                     then to work in service level roles (partly because there are few academic
                     jobs). […] This problem of employment and career and progression taps into a
                     general frustration for young scholars in our field.</quote>

               </cit>
               <p>In her analysis, Terras refers to a couple of tweets that together with her own
                  experience of the field demonstrate the difficult situation for young digital
                  humanists. There can be no doubt that what she describes is a very real situation.
                  However, her focus would seem mainly to be humanities computing as digital
                  humanities, and not young researchers with an investment in the digital humanities
                  who are anchored in a traditional disciplinary and scholarly context (who, for
                  instance, may have a fairly clear route to a Ph.D.). John Unsworth portrays such a
                  new generation of researchers at a conference at Yale University: <cit>
                     <quote rend="block" source="#unsworth2010">The first thing to note is that the conference was
                        organized by graduate students, not faculty. The co-chairs of the event were
                        Molly Farrel (Ph.D. in English expected in 2010, dissertation title
                        “Counting Bodies: Imagining Population in the New World"; […], Heather
                        Klemann (Ph.D. candidate in Comparative Literature, no date given,

                        (Ph.D. in History expected in 2011, dissertation title "The Liberal
                        Schoolmaster"). How did these students get drawn into the digital
                        humanities?</quote>

                        <ptr target="#unsworth2010" loc="12–13"/>(URLs removed)</dhq:citRef>
                  </cit>.</p>
               <p>These students are obviously already well on a path to finishing their Ph.Ds. The
                  job market, generally speaking, may not seem very promising for new humanities
                  Ph.Ds. at this point in time, but it would seem quite likely that if they are
                  interested in pursuing an academic career they would be destined for tenure-track
                  or equivalent positions rather than service level roles not necessarily because
                  they would not be interested, but because their kind of digital humanities would
                  seem more closely aligned with the disciplines and the disciplinary career paths
                  than with the epistemic tradition and paths associated with humanities computing.
                  There is a risk of conflating these different traditions in using
                     <soCalled>digital humanities</soCalled> to denote a specific set of epistemic
                  commitments. </p>

                     Kirschenbaum, McCarty, Ayers, Stallybrass, and me, is a generation of graduate
                     students who essentially learned to do research with digital tools; they aren't
                     necessarily aware of the history that's implicit, just barely submerged, in the
                     exchanges we've been considering here — they actually don't care all that much
                     about the back-story. They're interested in grabbing these tools, using these
                     new library services, and making their own mark, and they have some interesting

               <p>Here, it can be argued that the Yale graduate students that serve as Unsworth’s
                  example did not necessarily come to the digital humanities (whether to stay is an
                  open question) through the tools or through a primary wish to utilize these tools
                  but rather for another kind of engagement with the digital.<note>Incidentally, two
                     of the three Yale conference chairs listed are women, whereas two of ten
                     ‘founding fathers’ listed by Unsworth are women.</note> This is probably one of
                  the main differences between the Yale conference and traditional humanities
                  computing events, and in this sense, the back story is quite important.</p>

               <p>Interestingly, Stephen Ramsay (among the first generation people listed above)
                  commented on digital humanities at Yale University in an MLA 2011 position
                  statement:</p>
               <cit>
                  <quote rend="block" source="#ramsay2011a">But what if Duke or Yale were to offer a degree in Digital
                     Humanities and they said <q>no</q> to code and <q>yes</q> to text? Or <q>no</q> to
                     building and <q>yes</q> to theorizing? Or decided that
                     Digital Humanities is what we used to call New Media Studies (which is the
                     precise condition, as far as I can tell, at Dartmouth)? You might need to know
                     how to code in order to be competitive for relevant grants with the ODH, NSF,
                     or Mellon. Maybe that means Yale’s DH ambitions will never get off the ground.
                     Or maybe Yale is powerful enough to redefine the mission of those institutions
                     with respect to the Humanities. Most institutions, for the record, are
                     not.</quote>
                  <ptr target="#ramsay2011a"/>
               </cit>
               <p>This quote illustrates some of the tension arising between different epistemic
                  traditions (Svensson 2009) and between different types of institutions (cf. <ptr target="#gailey2010"/>) within <soCalled>big tent</soCalled> digital
                  humanities. Here, <soCalled>coding</soCalled> (and building) is presented as a
                  central epistemic commitment of the digital humanities and the presumed criteria
                  of (some) funding agencies are used to emphasize the centrality of this
                  commitment. Admittedly, Ramsay’s statement is deliberately provocative, and he
                  does modulate it somewhat in a follow-up blog post (Ramsay 2011b).<note>In
                     commenting on his own statement, Ramsay (<ptr target="#ramsay2011b"/>)
                     modulates his original statement (in particular using <q>building</q> instead of <q>coding</q>) and
                     provides some softening, but in principle he does not back down in terms of the
                     epistemic basis to his argument. An intricate question here is what is included
                     in <soCalled>building</soCalled> (see also Alan Liu’s comment on Ramsay’s blog
                     entry, <ptr target="#ramsay2011b"/>), but Ramsay’s notion of building seems
                     anchored in the kind of building found in humanities computing.</note> It can
                  nevertheless be argued that this is an example of a first generation digital
                  humanist, with a clear investment in humanities computing as digital humanities,
                  excluding the very new generation of digital humanists that Unsworth describes
                  above. It is also noteworthy that the Ph.D. thesis topics listed by Unsworth do
                  not seem to indicate any strong coding component (or building element in a
                  technical sense). </p>
               <p>In a blog entry, Davidson argues for a radically different position when she
                  discusses a colleague’s dissatisfaction with some digital humanities interviewees’
                  insistence on stating <q>knowing HTML</q> as a primary job
                  qualification: </p>
               <cit>
                  <quote rend="block" source="#davidson2011">We senior Digital Humanities scholars (no matter what position
                     we take, no matter what side we are on) cannot make knowing or not knowing Mark

                     our field by provincializing it — and by stigmatizing our students out of the
                     one area where there are jobs right now. […] An ideal job candidate burns with
                     the passion of making a field anew.   Vision, expansiveness, imagination,
                     ideas, and brilliance are the requirements.   Knowing or not knowing HTML is
                     way down the list of attributes that make colleagues know that you are the one

               <p>Davidson emphasizes the importance of humanistic research challenges and visionary
                  work, and she presents a much less exclusionary (if directional) point of view.
                  Again, we can see how a new generation of scholars becomes part of the discussion
                  of the future of the digital humanities and gets entangled in associated epistemic
                  traditions. Indeed, an aspiring young digital humanist listening in on the above
                  conversation may rightly feel somewhat confused. In itself, a certain level of
                  uncertainty and dynamicity in relation to an enterprise such as the digital
                  humanities is not necessarily a problem. However, strictly enforcing epistemic
                  commitments in the way Ramsay does would not seem compatible with a broadly
                  conceived digital humanities (arguably an important reason behind the current
                  interest in the field), and with a view of the field as a meeting place and
                  innovation hub (where people may come from one tradition and engage with other
                  traditions). In particular, it would seem wise not to exclude individuals that can
                  help build and expand the field.</p>
               <p>Returning to the earlier citation from Terras’s manuscript, it may be claimed that
                  the <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#terras2010">general frustration for young scholars in our
                     field</quote><ptr target="#terras2010"/></cit> is an example of assigning a role
                  and sentiment to a whole <soCalled>new</soCalled> generation of scholars. This
                  kind of discourse feeds into the narrative of digital humanities as a field and
                  confirms the need for change and/or action. Naturally, there is frustration and a
                  multitude of challenges associated with higher education, and the humanities seems
                  to be in a particularly vulnerable position. However, there is also a great deal
                  of hope, energy and opportunity as well as an increasing number of jobs. It is
                  important not only to acknowledge that young and junior scholars undoubtedly are
                  potential agents of change but also to be careful about assigning them prescribed
                  roles. </p>
               <p>In any case, large-scale changes projected in vision statements for the digital
                  humanities are likely to affect coming scholars more than people in established
                  structures. For instance, a reformed tenure system will obviously not affect
                  tenured faculty to the same extent as untenured faculty. Nor can there be any
                  doubt that there is a new generation of researchers invested in the digital and in
                  exploring and challenging structures that may make digitally inflected work
                  contested or institutionally misplaced. In addition, it is of significance that
                  some of the early Ph.D. graduates that combined traditional scholarship with
                  digitally inflected work have now become tenured and institutionally more
                  powerful. However, the pace of change should probably not be overrated nor the
                  willingness to leverage such institutional power to overhaul the existing reward
                  structures. </p>

               <head>Technology as Transformative Discourse</head>
               <p>As the above examples indicate, information technology often becomes a way to
                  explore far-reaching issues beyond the actual subject matter at hand. There is
                  clearly hope and change embedded in the discourses of technology. Romanyshyn talks
                  about technology as the <cit>
                     <quote rend="inline" source="#romanyshyn1989">magic of the modern world.</quote>
                     <ptr target="#romanyshyn1989" loc="2"/>
                  </cit>. Technology, not least information technology, is intimately connected to
                  the idea of change and transformation. Hine says that <cit>
                     <quote rend="inline" source="#hine2003">information and communications technologies have been a
                        highly persuasive means of imagining our future.</quote>
                     <ptr target="#hine2003" loc="1"/>
                  </cit> Change is naturally related and often thought of in relation to a previous
                  stage of technological development and the broader context of that technology. An
                  earlier example of this can be seen in Winner’s analysis of the introduction of
                  aviation, which describes how aviation was projected to eliminate barriers that
                  had divided humans and how it would bring about a new level of human relations.
                  Winner states:</p>
               <cit>
                  <quote rend="block" source="#winner2004">As is often the case of such visions, the political edge of
                     the fantasy focused on social problems associated with a previous stage of

               </cit>
               <p>Importantly, the projected societal, political and cultural change does not always
                  stand in a direct or foreseeable relation to the technology in question. The
                  leverage of the vision can thus extend far beyond seemingly reasonable
                  expectations of the technological innovation itself. Sturken and Thomas point to
                  how technological change more generally affords <cit>

                  </cit> For the digital humanities, the contextual backdrop is often the current
                  state of the humanities and higher learning more generally, and the projected
                  transformation concerns the reformation of these systems.</p>

               <p>In the case of information technology, we are concerned with a multitude of
                  different technologies and complex cultural and societal contexts. It is true that
                  previous layers of technological innovation have historically been simplified,
                  conflated and attributed into a single innovation (cf. Eisenstein’s work on the
                  printing press in Eisenstein 1997), but the pervasiveness and multifaceted
                  character of contemporary information technology distinguishes it from most other
                  layers of technology. An important factor is the way in which information
                  technology seems to cut across different domains, thus making it a particularly

                  <quote rend="block" source="#manifesto2009">Whereas the modern university segregated scholarship from
                     curation, demoting the latter to a secondary, supportive role, and sending
                     curators into exile within museums, archives, and libraries, the Digital
                     Humanities revolution promotes a fundamental reshaping of the research and

               <p>Obvious indications of this transformative sentiment can be found in the word

                  particular genre of manifestos, but we certainly find this sentiment expressed in
                  other text types as well. </p>
               <p>The transformative discourse of technology is frequently coupled with a sense of
                  emergency and sudden change (cf. <ptr target="#noble2001"/> for correspondence
                  education as an example of this), as well as a consequent pressure to change. This

                  above and in their description of how we are now presented with an <cit>

                  to be invoked repeatedly in the history of a discipline. In the context of
                  releasing a new report on humanities scholarship and technology in 2006 (<ptr target="#unsworth2006"/>), the American Council of Learned Societies describes
                  how they have issued five earlier reports on the same topic (although with other
                  foci). In this sense, the digital humanities is obviously not a new enterprise,
                  but nevertheless there is still often a sense of newness and urgency. </p>
               <p>The tendency to focus on the proximate future has been observed in relation to

                  series (see e.g. <ptr target="#svensson2011"/>), in addition to the sense of

               <head>Introduction</head>
               <p>An important source of material about the hopes, visions and expectations
                  associated with the digital humanities is various institutional documents and
                  websites, articulated visions, manifests and mission statements. This is by no
                  means a uniform or unproblematic genre, and sometimes visionary and
                  forward-looking statements are susceptible to criticism because of their very
                  nature. For instance, they will typically not exhibit the kind of rigor associated
                  with academic papers. Visionary statements are normally not easily verifiable as
                  they are projecting the future and may be proven obviously wrong in due time. They
                  can thus provide an easy target for attack and even ridicule, and it is important
                  to exercise analytical caution. As for the digital humanities, many institutions
                  do not present a clear vision or mission (cf. Terras 2010), which could arguably
                  be seen as problematic as highly tendentious visions.</p>
               <p>As Hine <ptr target="#hine2003" loc="2"/> convincingly argues, visionary documents
                  and similar material present us with an analytical opportunity (cf. also <ptr target="#jankowski2009" loc="6"/>). She points to the fact that practices and
                  knowledge outcomes are indeed changing as a result of digital technologies, that
                  investments in scholarly technology are quite substantial and that science is a
                  significant area of our social life. In their analysis of the domain vision of
                  ubiquitous computing, Bell and Dourish <ptr target="#bell2007"/> point to how
                  visions not only tell us about the future but also about the present. Hine <ptr target="#hine1995"/> shows how technology can be used in processes of
                  disciplinary change and reorientation. She looks at the biological discipline of
                  taxonomy and how a particular information system approach could be interpreted as
                  imposing a specific model of the discipline through the technology. A similar
                  argument could easily be made for certain attempts at devising cyberinfrastructure
                  for the humanities or, indeed, for specific visions or manifestos for the digital
                  humanities. The stakes are considerable, and it is argued that a discursive
                  analysis can help us both understand the contemporary landscape of the digital
                  humanities, the hopes invested, and the issues and models that are projected
                  through these visions and expectations.</p>
               <p>Expectations can be an integral part of the frame of certain genres or types of
                  discourse. For instance, a manifesto is typically expected to be high-key,
                  opinioned, make a case and be engaged with the future. A white paper for a new
                  institutional or funding initiative is normally more low key and at least
                  seemingly factual and it is also inherently forward-looking. While other text
                  types may be more <soCalled>neutral</soCalled> in this regard, we need to be
                  sensitive to framing and associated expectations (cf. <ptr target="#entman1993"/>). A simple example would be an interview with Brett Bobley, Director of the NEH
                  Office of Digital Humanities, that was published on the HASTAC website in the
                  beginning of February 2009 (<ptr target="#smith2009"/>). The theme was <title rend="quotes">The Future of the Digital Humanities</title> and the interview
                  was carried out by two HASTAC scholars. Here the expectations are suggested by the
                  questions, which seem to project a visionary sentiment and a particular kind of
                  frame. This is particularly noticeable in first two questions in this particular
                  interview. The first set of questions was <quote rend="inline" source="#smith2009">What are the most
                     interesting innovations happening right now in the field of digital humanities,
                     and is it possible to predict or anticipate what will be most important in the
                     future?</quote> and the second set of questions was <quote rend="inline" source="#smith2009">How do
                     you see digital technology transforming work in the disciplines of the
                     humanities? Are there disciplines in which digital technology will have less of
                     an impact?</quote> Here, the framing itself, articulated through the questions,
                  suggests a notion of the digital humanities as innovative culture, giving
                  technology a transformative power. </p>
               <p>I will now look critically at four specific texts that have a clear
                  forward-looking sentiment in relation to the digital humanities and
                  cyberinfrastructure for the humanities: a manifesto, scholarly report,
                  institutional website and plenary lecture. </p>

               <head>A Manifesto</head>
               <p>The <title rend="quotes">Digital Humanities Manifesto 2.0</title> is the second
                  iteration of a document first produced in 2008-2009. The question of authorship is
                  somewhat complex and we will come back to it, but <q>parts of
                     the manifesto</q> were written by Todd Presner, Jeffrey Schnapp and Peter
                  Lunenfeldt. Presner introduced the second version of the Manifesto on his
                  blog:</p>
               <cit>
                  <quote rend="block" source="#manifesto2009">The purpose of the Digital Humanities Manifesto is to arouse
                     debate about what the Humanities can and should be doing in the 21st century,
                     particularly concerning the digital culture wars, which are, by and large,
                     being fought and won by corporate interests. It is also a call to assert the
                     relevance and necessity of the Humanities in a time of downsizing and
                     persistent requiems of their death. The Humanities, I believe, are more
                     necessary than ever as our cultural heritage as a species migrates to digital
                     formats. This is a watershed moment in the history of human civilization, in
                     which our relationship to knowledge and information is changing in profound and
                     unpredictable ways. Digital Humanities studies the cultural and social impact
                     of new technologies as well as takes an active role in the design,
                     implementation, interrogation, and subversion of these technologies.</quote>
                  <ptr target="#manifesto2009"/>
               </cit>
               <p>This is a clear example of how the digital humanities can become a means to
                  discuss the future of the humanities at large. There is a clear sense of the
                  urgency required if we are to act on this <q>watershed moment in
                     the history of human civilization.</q> The answer, seemingly, is the
                  digital humanities, although the exact nature of the link (beyond our cultural
                  heritage becoming digital) between the necessity to reconfigure the humanities and
                  the digital humanities may not be entirely clear from this fragment. While the
                  incarnation of cultural heritage in the first part of the citation may seem to
                  indicate a particular type of digital humanities, the final sentence presents a
                  broad and fairly open definition of the field. It is noteworthy that several modes
                  of engagement between the humanities and the digital are incorporated into this
                  vision. There is an emphasis on the broad study of the impact of technologies as
                  well as on actively engaging with design, implementation and subversion. </p>
               <p>The pdf version of the manifesto is a 14-page long document with extensive visual
                  material, although the visuals are more illustrative than core to the argument
                  (not surprising given that the basic manifesto is text based). It is clearly
                  stated on the first page that we are not concerned with an academic treatise, and
                  if you <q>are wondering who is reaching out here, the answer is
                     plural.</q> There is no explicated authorship in the actual manifesto, and
                  interestingly the strongest indication of authorship and ownership can be found in
                  the initial disclaimer of the Commentpress version of the manifesto (not in the
                  pdf version): <quote rend="inline" source="#manifesto2009">The content of the manifesto represents the
                     view of the authors and does not claim to represent the views of UCLA, the UCLA
                     Humanities, Division, and the Digital Humanities at UCLA.</quote> The three
                  institutions named should seem to be more likely sites of ownership and authorship
                  than others – or the disclaimer would presumably not be necessary.</p>
               <p>The Digital Humanities Manifesto 2.0 describes a universe where <cit>
                     <quote rend="inline" source="#manifesto2009">print is no longer the exclusive or the normative medium
                        in which knowledge is produced and/or disseminated</quote>
                     <ptr target="#manifesto2009" loc="2"/>
                  </cit>, and where digital tools, techniques and media <quote rend="inline" source="#manifesto2009">have
                     altered the production and dissemination of knowledge in the arts, human and
                     social sciences.</quote> While these are by no means <soCalled>weak</soCalled>
                  assertions, the subsequent set of sentences make an unquestionably strong
                  statement:</p>
               <cit>
                  <quote rend="block" source="#manifesto2009">The Digital Humanities seeks to play an inaugural role with
                     respect to a world in which, no longer the sole producers, stewards, and
                     disseminators of knowledge or culture, universities are called upon to shape
                     natively digital models of scholarly discourse for the newly emergent public
                     spheres of the present era (the www, the blogosphere, digital libraries, etc.),
                     to model excellence and innovation in these domains, and to facilitate the
                     formation of networks of knowledge production, exchange, and dissemination that
                     are, at once, global and local. </quote>
                  <ptr target="#manifesto2009" loc="2"/>
               </cit>
               <p>This is partly an institutional vision or assertion in the sense that it projects
                  a future role of the field of digital humanities. Manifestos, by nature, tend to
                  draw on stark contrasts, and here the digital humanities is a key player in a
                  world where universities, displaced as principal producers of knowledge, are
                     <q>called upon</q> to form new digital models of
                  scholarship for a set of public spheres currently emerging. The question is who is
                  doing the calling, and if the juxtaposition of a world where universities
                  supposedly were sole producers of knowledge with a world where universities are
                  supposedly called upon is not too stark and simple to actually be productive. </p>
               <p>A range of contrasts are presented in the manifesto. For instance, it relates a
                  contemporary structure of small and rigorous academic areas of expertise and
                  sub-expertise to a digital humanities with large-scale projects, distributed
                  models and <soCalled>big pictures</soCalled> partly built on expert knowledge. A
                  university that segregates scholarship from curation is contrasted with a world
                  where curation is a central feature of the future of the humanities disciplines.
                  The traditional disciplinary structure is questioned, and the manifesto asks: why
                  defend 19th century structures when <cit>
                     <quote rend="inline" source="#manifesto2009">the intellectual ground has shifted out from under their
                        feet?</quote>
                     <ptr target="#manifesto2009" loc="11"/>
                  </cit>. Statements like these make it quite clear that the digital humanities is
                  employed as a means of rethinking the academy and scholarship more generally and
                  that the digital sometimes functions more as a lead-in or a projectile than a
                  sustained focus.</p>
               <p>Let us now return to questions of how the <title rend="quotes">Digital Humanities
                     Manifesto 2.0,</title> was created and agency. According to Todd Presner (<ptr target="#presner2009b"/>), one of the main authors of the manifesto, the text
                  was partly written by himself, Jefrrey Schnapp and Peter Lunenfeldt. Other parts
                  came from a collaborative process through a Commentpress blog (where most of the
                  comments addressed the first version of the manifest), and participants of the
                  Mellon Seminar in Digital Humanities wrote even other parts. This process is
                  particularly interesting given the strong argument made in the manifesto for
                  co-creative scholarly processes, social media as a model, and the emphasis on the
                  manifesto as a product of plurality and iterative scholarship. Looking at the
                  comments on the first version of the manifesto, published on December 15, 2008,
                  there were a total of 116 comments as of March 25, 2010 (comments were made on the
                  whole text as well individual paragraphs). Of these, almost half (49% or 57

                  did not play a very active part in this web-based space, and it is unclear how
                  comments were implemented in the second version of the manifesto or how the
                  different modes of authorship interrelated (main authors, Commentpress, seminar
                  participants). What is clear, however, is that the main authors have authority.
                  The only apparent main author comment for the first version of the manifesto,
                  apart from a blog entry announcement, contained a suggestion:</p>

                  <title rend="quotes">Our Cultural Commonwealth</title> was published in 2006 by
                  the American Council of Learned Societies, which in 2004 asked John Unsworth to
                  chair a Commission on Cyberinfrastructure for the humanities and social sciences
                  (appointed by ACLS). Unsworth selected the other members of the commission and its
                  advisers. In the foreword to the report, it says that the <cit>

                  </cit>. Importantly, the focus of the report is not the digital humanities

               <p>The foreword, signed by the president of the ACLS, may not set the frame quite as
                  distinctly as the HASTAC interview questions we considered earlier, but there is
                  certainly visionary sentiment here too. Indeed the first sentence of the foreword
                  frames the report:</p>

               <p>The president also points out that earlier reports on the same topic focused on

               <p>The links between computing as a cultural force, humanities scholarship and
                  cyberinfrastructure are complex. For instance, in contrast to the above
                  assumption, it could be argued that humanities scholarship in relation to
                  computing as a cultural force can be carried out without large-scale investments
                  in cyberinfrastructure. For instance, critical studies of computation do not
                  necessarily require extensive research infrastructure.</p>
               <p>The first chapter of the report is entitled <title rend="quotes">Possibilities: A
                     Grand Challenge for the Humanities and Social Sciences.</title> One initial
                  frame of reference is teenagers and their creative and communicative and social

               </cit>
               <p>It might be questioned whether humanities and social science scholars will ever
                  lead the way in designing pervasive cultural infrastructure of this type, but it
                  is certainly a major vision and challenge. However, as we have already noted, the
                  invocation of a digital generation can be problematic. It could be argued that we
                  are concerned with two fairly disparate levels of infrastructure and cultural
                  representation in this case. On the one hand, everyday cultural, social and
                     <soCalled>creative</soCalled> uses of digital technology as part of our
                  everyday lives – especially young peoples’ everyday lives (cf. <ptr target="#livingstone2009"/>). On the other hand, digitalized cultural heritage
                  and digitally supported access. The connection between these two levels seems
                  fairly weak in the text under consideration. The report clearly focuses on the
                  latter, and the overall vision would seem to be the unification of public record
                     (<ptr target="#unsworth2006" loc="17"/>) and general access to digital cultural
                  heritage:</p>
               <cit>
                  <quote rend="block" source="#unsworth2006">We should place the world’s cultural heritage – its historical
                     documentation, its literary and artistic achievements its languages, beliefs,
                     and practices – within the reach of very citizen. </quote>

               </cit>
               <p>As we have already noted, this is indeed a strong and utopian vision, although in
                  contrast with some of the visions we have discussed above, it seems more precise
                  and directly related to the digital humanities – in particular the tradition of
                  humanities computing. One of the most established digital humanists, Jerome
                  McGann, is reported to have said the following at the UVA Conference <title rend="italic">The Shape of Things to Come</title>: <cit>
                     <quote rend="inline" source="#cordell2010">McGann's big vision: every book, every periodical, every

                  </cit>. There is also an explicit allusion to the <quote rend="inline" source="#unsworth2006">inherently
                     democratizing power</quote> of digital information in the report (<ptr target="#unsworth2006" loc="27"/>). The above vision of public access to
                  digitalized cultural heritage is materialized through a list of necessary
                  characteristics for associated cyberinfrastructure. According to the report, such
                  cyberinfrastructure would have to be accessible as a public good, be sustainable,
                  provide interoperability (seamless across repositories), facilitate collaboration
                  and support experimentation. This technology is presumed to come with considerable
                  leverage:</p>
               <cit>
                  <quote rend="block" source="#unsworth2006">Evolving technologies not only provide unprecedented access to
                     a variety of cultural artifacts but also make it possible to see these

                  <ptr target="#unsworth2006" loc="15"/>
               </cit>
               <p>Here we find reference to the proximate future often invoked by technology through
                     <q>evolving technologies.</q> These technologies do not
                  only give excellent (<q>unprecedented</q>) access to
                  cultural artifacts, but also make it possible to see these artifacts in entirely
                     (<q>completely</q>) new ways. This is a fairly
                  positivistic argument, associated with the discourse of cyberinfrastructure (cf.
                     <ptr target="#svensson2011"/>), which gives significant agency to technology.
                  Furthermore, it is quite clear that the cyberinfrastructure envisioned is strongly
                  associated with cultural heritage, repositories and perseveration.</p>
               <p>The focus on cultural heritage is also apparent in the set of recommendations
                  given in the report (<ptr target="#unsworth2006" loc="23–29"/>), even if they are
                  more general. The recommendations include prioritizing investment in
                  cyberinfrastructure for the humanities and social sciences, promoting openness and
                  access, and creating extensive and reusable digital collections. This focus is not
                  surprising, given the nature of the report, but there is an interesting conflation
                  of the fairly specific use of research infrastructure and a more general vision.
                  For instance, in the executive summary of the report, it says that Chapter 1 <cit>
                     <quote rend="inline" source="#unsworth2006">makes the case for the transformative potential of an
                        improved cyberinfrastructure with respect to the preservation and
                        availability of our cultural heritage</quote>
                     <ptr target="#unsworth2006" loc="2"/>
                  </cit>. In the introduction, it is also said that the same chapter <cit>
                     <quote rend="inline" source="#unsworth2006">articulates a vision for the future of the humanities and
                        social sciences</quote>
                     <ptr target="#unsworth2006" loc="9"/>
                  </cit>. The report focuses considerably more on the former than the latter. In
                  doing so, it arguably engages more with a science and engineering based model for
                  research infrastructure and a humanities computing interest in cultural heritage
                  than with an inclusive and far-reaching vision for the humanities.</p>

               <p>The work of envisioning the digital humanities is naturally also done on the
                  institutional level, and I will now turn to an examination of institutional web
                  presences for the digital humanities. In fact, many institutional websites do not
                  provide elaborate information on visions or even goals (as noted by <ptr target="#terras2010"/>). Others provide fairly extensive statements and
                  visionary grounding. While some of these websites may not be updated consistently
                  or be seen as a community expressions, they still constitute an important mode of
                  institutional representation and outwards projection. Instead of surveying a great
                  many websites, many of which are not very rich in terms of visionary content, I
                  will look at one particular example in more detail.</p>
               <p>At the time of this study, the Institute for Computing in Humanities, Arts, and
                  Social Science (ICHASS) at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign had a
                  prominent multi-colored textual banner on the cover page of their website saying
                     <q>Sparking a revolution in digital humanities, arts, and
                     social science research and education.</q> In their mission and goal
                  statement, the close collaboration with the high performance computing center is
                  quite clear in terms of the vision and frame articulated:</p>
               <cit>
                  <quote rend="block" source="#ichass2010">With an emphasis on identifying, creating, and adapting
                     computational tools that accelerates research and education, I-CHASS engages
                     visionary scholars from across the globe to demonstrate approaches that
                     interface next-generation interdisciplinary research with high-performance
                     computing. I-CHASS provides these researchers with world-class computational
                     resources, both human and technical, to enhance their knowledge discovery and
                     exploration.</quote>

               </cit>
               <p>Here, we are concerned with a vision that is partly tool based, with a particular
                  focus on high-performance computing. The visionary sentiment is strengthened
                  through language such as <q>accelerates research and
                     education,</q>
                  <q>visionary scholars</q> and <q>next-generation interdisciplinary research.</q> The offer to researchers

                  The quote above suggests a clear separation of scholars and human <q>computational resources.</q> Unsurprisingly, there is also a
                  fairly pronounced focus on technology and on helping the humanities, arts and

                  suggest a model where scholars in the humanities are <soCalled>helped</soCalled>
                  by computing and other related competencies (for a critique of this model, see
                     <ptr target="#drucker2009b"/>). The latter group does the work of
                     <soCalled>leveraging</soCalled> the appropriate (mostly data intensive)
                  technologies, and providing assistance. The assumption, possibly correct, is that
                  humanities scholars have limited computational knowledge. However, the phrasing
                  below suggests a clear framing based on predetermined and separate roles: </p>
               <cit>
                  <quote rend="block" source="#ichass2010">We show researchers and students with little knowledge of

               </cit>
               <p>Also, the process described (<q>We show</q>) would not seem
                  to indicate a particularly iterative and integrated approach. These quotes
                  arguably contribute to construing humanities researchers and students as subjects,
                  rather than active, co-creative agents. There is little in the text about
                  humanities driven research challenges, and presumably the
                     <soCalled>brokering</soCalled> is often carried out in relation to available
                  technologies and the opportunities these present.</p>

               <head>Addressing the Community</head>
               <p>As was previously mentioned, Melissa Terras was the concluding plenary speaker at
                  the Digital Humanities 2010 conference at King’s College, London, on July 10,
                     2010.<note> The following discussion is primarily based on the manuscript
                     Terras usefully posted on her blog after the talk as well as on the streamed
                     version of the talk (made available by the DH 2010 conference). Citations are
                     taken from the manuscript. All citations have been checked against the streamed
                     version, and while there is expectedly no exact word-by-word correspondence,
                     there is at least rough correspondence in terms of meaning. In two cases, the
                     citations given do not have any direct linguistic correspondence in the
                     streamed version. The analysis, however, is based on the (widely disseminated)
                     written manuscript, and it is argued that there is enough relation to the
                     actual speech to warrant the more general and contextual conclusions drawn from
                     the material. Additionally, some of the concurrent and online discussion is
                     considered in the analysis. </note> Her speech attracted a large local and
                  distributed audience and much appreciation. While it may not be full of visionary
                     <soCalled>speak</soCalled> of the kind we just examined in the context of
                  institutional websites, it is quite relevant in terms of forward-looking sentiment
                  and discussing the future of the digital humanities. Indeed, the talk was
                  described as <cit>

                  various media and channels including an article in the <title rend="italic">Times

                  the article, presumably demonstrates how difficult it can be to
                     <soCalled>sell</soCalled> a message that is somewhat dismal in such a way that
                  it actually promotes the field.</p>
               <p>Terras makes an initial point of the plenary not being done by someone <quote rend="inline" source="#terras2010">external to the community,</quote> but rather someone <quote rend="inline" source="#terras2010">well within the community.</quote> The community addressed is, of
                  course, mainly the attendees at the conference – physically present in the room or
                  watching the live-streamed version in another lecture theater – and the members of
                  the conference associations. More generally, the community addressed would seem to
                  be the community of digital humanities, which is evident from the title <title rend="quotes">Present, Not Voting: Digital Humanities in the
                     Panopticon.</title> At the end of the manuscript, Terras says:</p>
               <cit>
                  <quote rend="block" source="#terras2010">This has been an honest tour of what DH means to me, and some
                     of the issues which DH is presented with at the moment.</quote>

               </cit>
               <p>It is thus very clear that the talk is about the digital humanities. In the
                  written manuscript, the denomination <q>digital
                     humanities</q> is employed 36 times and <q>DH</q> in
                  the sense of digital humanities (excluding references to the DH2010 conference)
                  occurs 35 times.<note>7438 words in total including the title.</note> Importantly,
                  there is a considerable emphasis on community and community building, which is
                  lexically demonstrated by 25 instances of the very word <q>community.</q> The personal pronoun <q>we</q>
                  carries an important including role in the text, and there are as many as 134
                  occurrences of this word in the manuscript. Incidentally, there are no instances
                  of <q>humanities computing,</q> which used to be the
                  self-identifying community denomination of the associations behind the Digital
                  Humanities conference. These frequency data are necessarily crude, but they give
                  us a sense of how language is used to address and include the field and community. </p>
               <p>A simple comparison is offered by John Unsworth’s recent talk on the state of the
                  digital humanities <ptr target="#unsworth2010"/>. The two texts are roughly
                  equally long, and based on normalized data, Terras references the <q>digital humanities</q> 1.2 times as often as Unsworth (a
                  total of 125 instances in both texts), which seemingly shows the primacy of this
                  concept in both texts. However, Terras refers to <q>community</q> about 8 times as often as Unsworth, and <q>we</q> is close to 4 times more frequent in Terras’s text.<note>Number of
                     words: Terras/Unsworth/Unsworth normalized: 7538/6897/7538, digital
                     humanities/dh: 71/54/59, community 25/3/3, we 134/33/36.</note> This clearly
                  demonstrates Terras’s emphasis on the community and her inclusive mode of address.
                  The focus on the field is also evident in the use of the very term <q>field,</q> which occurs 19 times in the sense of the field of
                  digital humanities. There are also 11 instances of <q>discipline</q> in the sense of the discipline of digital humanities. The
                  latter figure is arguably more interesting in that <q>discipline</q> may be seen as suggesting a comparatively high degree of
                  institutionalization, as well as a view of digital humanities having a discipline
                  or near-discipline status.</p>
               <p>The context and contemporary moment make Terras’s talk particularly interesting.
                  Her talk is situated in the annual and long-standing digital humanities conference
                  with a strong heritage in humanities computing at a time when the field is
                  undergoing expansion and negotiation and when there is discussion of inclusion and
                  exclusion (<ptr target="#rockwell2010"/>). While Terras in no way is an
                  accountable representative of digital humanities, or a specific tradition, she
                  performed a significant role as a chosen plenary speaker within the field of
                  digital humanities and as a representative of the community associated with the
                  digital humanities at a key conference at an important point in time. Also, the
                  talk is significant because of the praise it received within the community and
                  among conference participants:</p>

                     <ptr target="#prescott2010a"/>
                  </cit>. It thus seems clear that the plenary struck a chord with the digital
                  humanities community, and that there is a lasting sense of visionary sentiment and
                  power.</p>
               <p>In the talk, a specific project – The Bentham Project (which aims at producing new
                  editions of the scholarship of Jeremy Bentham) – is presented and used as a way to
                  discuss digital humanities more generally. After a discussion of mainly the
                  technical and structural development of the project (keywords include access,
                  transcriptions, crowdsourcing, text encoding initiative and digitalization), it is
                  said that: </p>
               <cit>
                  <quote rend="block" source="#terras2010">We can peer at Digital Humanities through this one project,
                     and see the transformative aspects that technologies have had on our working
                     practices, and the practices of those working in the historical domain.</quote>
                  <ptr target="#terras2010"/>
               </cit>
               <p>Two observations can be made here. Firstly, technology is given considerable
                  agency, the strength of which is indicated through the adjective <q>transformative.</q> Secondly, a clear distinction is made
                  between <quote rend="inline" source="#terras2010">our working practices</quote> (those of the digital
                  humanities participants) and the practices of <q>those working
                     in the historical domain</q> (cf. the discussion of I-CHASS above). This
                  would seem to indicate a significant separation between the digital humanities
                  community and the humanities researchers (in this case mainly historians). Work
                  practices are part of the epistemic core of a discipline or tradition (<ptr target="#knorr1999" loc="7–8"/>), and therefore significant. This separation
                  should be seen as a problem, naturally, but would seem characteristic of the
                  tradition of humanities computing <ptr target="#svensson2009"/>. The role of the
                  digital humanist is that of an intermediary agent or representative of the
                     <soCalled>technology side</soCalled>. Terras says that <cit>
                     <quote rend="inline" source="#terras2010">I’ve just been drafted in to help bridge the gap between
                        primary sources, dedicated scholars, and new technology</quote>
                     <ptr target="#terras2010"/>
                  </cit>.</p>
               <p>While Terras does not explicitly advocate a particular type or subset of digital
                  humanities, her plenary lecture is deeply embedded within the tradition of
                  humanities computing and entangled with the three affiliated associations behind
                  the Digital Humanities conference. This may not be very surprising but certainly
                  interesting at a time when the landscape of digital humanities is being expanded
                  and negotiated. In her discussion of emerging issues in the digital humanities,
                  Terras gives evidence of her epistemic position. For instance, the above point
                  about digital humanists operating in between researchers, data and technology is
                  reiterated. Another example concerns the type of material and data. As I have
                  argued elsewhere <ptr target="#svensson2009" loc="§53"/>, humanities computing
                  tends to be concerned with digitalized materials rather than born-digital data.
                  Even though Terras discusses digital legacy data, there is little discussion of
                     <soCalled>new</soCalled> digital data: </p>
               <cit>
                  <quote rend="block" source="#terras2010">But as well as working with historical documents (or
                     artefacts, or whatever), it’s becoming increasingly common with the Digital
                     Humanities that we have to work with historical digital documents – or legacy
                     data, left over from the not-so-distant past, in different formats and
                     structures that need bringing into current thinking on best practice with
                     Digital data.</quote>
                  <ptr target="#terras2010"/>
               </cit>

               <p>Furthermore, it is clear from Terras’s discussion that a primary concern is
                  adequate text encoding of these materials. Again, this is not surprising, but
                  telling. Indeed, this traditional humanities computing engagement would seem to
                  help explain why the piece has had so much resonance in the community. Another
                  critical part to this resonance is that Terras is usefully pushing that same
                  tradition by talking about crowd-sourcing for transcribing, the importance of
                  high-quality digital presence, and the need to articulate what digital humanists
                  do.</p>
               <p>Of course, the Bentham Project as a historical transcription endeavor sets the
                  scene for this part of the talk, but the choice is not accidental. Terras says the
                  project shows the progression of the field in <quote rend="inline" source="#terras2010">historical
                     manuscript based projects</quote>:</p>
               <quote rend="block" source="#terras2010">The Bentham Project has been primarily occupied with print
                  output, gaining a web presence in the mid 1990s, then an online database of the
                  Bentham archive in the early 20th Century, and is now carrying out a moderately
                  large scale digitisation project to scan in Bentham’s writings for Transcribe
                  Bentham. In addition, the Bentham Project has gone from a simple web page, to
                  interactive Web 2.0 environment, from MS Word to TEI encoded XML texts, and from a
                  relatively inward looking academic project to an outward facing,
                  community-building exercise.</quote>
               <p>Indeed, it could be argued that the story of the Bentham Project is the story of
                  humanities computing as digital humanities more generally. This is part of the
                  appeal and strength of Terras’ talk. However, it is important to acknowledge that
                  this is one story and that there are other epistemic traditions. </p>
               <p>Epistemic commitments come into play when considering different modes of knowledge
                  production: </p>
               <quote rend="block" source="#terras2010">Because no matter how successful Transcribe Bentham, the <soCalled>impact</soCalled> will be felt in the same usual way – through
                  publications. This is a nonsense, but it’s part of the academic game, and is
                  becoming of increasing frustration to those working in the Digital Humanities.
                  It’s not enough to make something that is successful and interesting and well
                  used: you have to write a paper about it that gets published in the Journal of
                  Successful Academic Stuff to make that line on your CV count, and to justify your
                  time spent on the project.</quote>
               <p>Terras largely positions herself and the digital humanities outside of predominant
                  modes and structures of knowledge production. There can be no doubt that the issue
                  of what qualifies as acceptable modes of knowledge production is an important one
                  and that there is a considerable top-down push – not least in the UK through the
                  Research Evaluation Framework. It is noteworthy here, though, that the Center for
                  Computing in the Humanities at King’s College did very well in the 2008 Research
                  Assessment Exercise <ptr target="#cch2009"/>. This is a complex issue, however,
                  and there is considerable variation across a more broadly conceived digital
                  humanities. The above statement, and especially the sentiment evident through use
                  of descriptors such as <q>nonsense</q> and <q>part of the academic game,</q> may resonate with part of the
                  humanities computing community, heavily invested in the type of production Terras
                  discusses, but it may not harmonize with the many digital humanists invested in
                  traditional or mixed modes of knowledge production. A key question is what
                  alternative is offered. How will the digital humanities have a real long-term
                  impact on the humanities and the academy? While, on one level, it may be good
                  enough to <q>make something that is successful and interesting
                     and well used,</q> it may not be good enough or convincing in terms of
                  potential scholarly impact, visionary power and outward credibility (which Terras
                  emphasizes elsewhere in her talk). </p>
               <p>A subsection of the written manuscript is called <title rend="quotes">Fears for
                     the Future,</title> and Terras paints a fairly bleak picture of the future of
                  the digital humanities. This sentiment, however, should be seen in the context of
                  the downturn in the economy and the problems for higher education in the UK and
                  elsewhere. Terras talks about <quote rend="inline" source="#terras2010">We’re all scared</quote> and
                  points to how we arrived to a different place: </p>
               <cit>
                  <quote rend="block" source="#terras2010">I remember very strongly that at the end of an upbeat DH2009
                     Neil Fraistat stood up and said <q>The Digital Humanities
                        have arrived!.</q> But in 2010, the place we have arrived to is a
                     changed landscape, and not nearly as optimistic.</quote>

               </cit>
               <p>Clearly this vision or addressing the future is different from some of the future
                  projections we have looked at so far. Indeed, after the Digital Humanities 2010
                  Conference, the situation in the UK has become worse than some of the direst
                  predictions. Terras makes a case for presenting and enacting the digital
                  humanities in the best possible way and to articulate what it means to be a
                  digital humanist and what the digital humanities is about. It makes sense to
                  ensure that digital humanities is funded at the time when funding is being
                  withdrawn from the Humanities. We need to be prepared, and to articulate and
                  explain why what we do is important, and relevant. </p>
               <p>But at the same time, it could be argued that what the digital humanities needs is
                  an inclusive and forward-looking (not necessarily utopian) vision. That strength
                  comes from incorporating different epistemic traditions and projecting digital
                  scholarship as well as substantial scholarly leverage.</p>

               <head>Introduction</head>
               <p>As we have seen, there are many different visionary statements, goals and hopes
                  associated with the digital humanities. Just as there is no single vision, there
                  is no one set of concerns, issues or technologies that feed into the process of
                  envisioning and defining the digital humanities. In this section, a vision of the
                  digital humanities will be presented in the form of a number of <soCalled>design
                     parameters</soCalled>. These do not project a singular vision, nor a set of
                  visions or issues, but rather a visionary space. </p>
               <p>Given the number of new and coming digital humanities initiatives, and the general
                  interest in the field it is hoped that these parameters can serve as
                     <emph>one</emph> starting point for a discussion. The aim is to stimulate
                  discussion and encourage reflection relating to some of the parameters below in an
                  implementation process rather than to impose a particular vision or a definite set
                  of design principles. A loose and suggestive vision seems viable given the fact
                  that the digital humanities is such a heterogeneous and contextually configured
                  entity. There is no single model or size that fits all. The difference between a
                  university-wide digital humanities center, a departmental research group and an
                  international virtual network is quite significant. Similarly, an institute
                  devoted to studies of the internet is quite different from a center focused on
                  creating and adapting tools for textual analysis. Furthermore, the context of a
                  technical university college or a liberal arts college is different from a
                  comprehensive university. An initiative imagined as a way of changing the
                  humanities (and the university) is different from an initiative focused on
                  strengthening research in one particular area.</p>

               <head>The Visionary Context</head>
               <p>It goes without saying that given this variation and multiplexity, factors such as
                  organizational placement, basic strategies and technical infrastructure are
                  contextual and disparate. Given an inclusive notion of the digital humanities, the
                  total scope of possible design parameters is quite large. If we look at
                  initiatives that self-identify as <soCalled>digital humanities</soCalled>, the
                  scope is somewhat smaller.</p>
               <p>Considering university level or humanities wide initiatives in the digital
                  humanities, there is not only considerable variation, but there are also many
                  commonalities. There is, for instance, typically a need to facilitate
                  collaborative work across traditional disciplines, stimulate faculty engagement,
                  and bring in funding for projects. Often there are infrastructural needs in terms
                  of space, technology and staff. In the case of initiatives invested in
                  reconfiguring the humanities, addressing the state and development of the
                  humanities will be a recurring interest. Since a university or school investment
                  in the digital humanities would normally be tightly linked to policy making and
                  funding opportunities, there would also be attempts at securing such funding or
                  influencing funding agencies at various levels to invest in the
                     <soCalled>new</soCalled> area. Long term, this process may lead to fewer
                     <soCalled>sizes</soCalled> of digital humanities, as these opportunities in
                  turn shape, or even constrain, new and, to a lesser extent, existing
                  initiatives.</p>
               <p>It would seem that the most easily identifiable type of digital humanities
                  initiative is the <soCalled>digital humanities center</soCalled>, broadly
                  referring to a distinct center with some kind of institutional stability, people
                  and technology resources, and as noted above, working across more than single
                  disciplines or research groups. Digital humanities centers are typically
                  associated with comprehensive universities or research universities, but they are
                  becoming more common also in other contexts (although not always called digital
                  humanities centers), while naturally not being the only model (cf. <ptr target="#sample2010a"/>). The history of digital humanities and humanities
                  computing includes a number of initiatives to list, group, network and discuss
                  such centers based on different criteria and assumptions (see e.g. <ptr target="#mccarty2003"/>, <ptr target="#zorich2008"/>, and the CenterNet
                  initiative).</p>

               <p>In her DH2010 plenary speech, Terras emphasizes the importance of looking at the
                  digital humanities from the outside <ptr target="#terras2010"/>. What does the
                  field project outwards? How do we present ourselves and the work we do? Taking
                  this assumed external position, I would briefly like to address some other
                  challenges that are relevant to envisioning the digital humanities but rarely get
                  much attention in whitepapers and on institutional websites. One important point
                  concerns the <soCalled>whiteness</soCalled> of digital humanities: </p>

               <p>Cong-Huyen’s reflection followed the MLA 2011 conference, and there seems to be a
                  sense that the digital humanities both lack in diversity in the community and in
                  approaching diversity and race critically (e.g. a THATCamp SoCal session on
                  diversity and digital humanities in January 2011). This latter point relates to a
                  concern that the digital humanities does not have a strong critical or theoretical
                  engagement. This concern, as articulated by various commentators, has surfaced
                  several times in this article series, and is clearly seen as problematic both
                  inside and outside the community. Higgin says that <cit>

                  is a place for envisioning a more critically engaged digital humanities and also
                  for considering how we communicate critical engagement as well as engagement in

               <head>A Visionary Scope of the Digital Humanities</head>
               <p>As we have seen, there is no single vision of the digital humanities, nor can a
                  single vision even be possible. Many visions are quite abstract and sweeping and
                  will thus be fairly inclusive and consequently lacking in concreteness. Likewise,
                  singular visionary statements have a tendency to be at least partly excluding in
                  their nature, and are sometimes also provocative. However, it would be unfortunate
                  if the visionary sentiment of the digital humanities could not be recruited in
                  thinking about the future while also maintaining grounding and a nuanced view.</p>
               <p>In the following, a visionary scope of the digital humanities will be contoured
                  using a set of design parameters. These parameters draw on personal experience,
                  the discussion in this article, as well as the article series in its entirety.
                  They are not meant to be all-inclusive nor a list to tick off, but rather
                  suggestive and ideally help initiate dialogue and reflection. Also, we need to
                  exercise critical caution while allowing for visionary work, experimentation and
                  engagement in the actual implementation of the digital humanities. </p>
               <p>There was a related discussion in <title rend="italic">Humanist</title> on
                  designing the academic digital humanities department in the fall of 2010. This
                  discussion was largely framed by <title rend="italic">Humanist</title> editor
                  Willard McCarty, and it focused mostly on a very practical level including
                  discussing ratios between technical staff and faculty, whether to do consultancy,
                  and the importance of communicating with the public. The framing did not only
                  encompass the questions posed by the editor, but also was grounded in a humanities
                  computing based tradition. Hence the inclusion of technical staff or technical
                  infrastructure, for instance, did not seem to meet any resistance. Some
                  discussants pointed to conceptual issues such as the importance of thinking about
                  how to support collaborative cultures: </p>

                     institutions are familiar with, nevertheless, no matter what structure

                     cultures between all participants be they academic, technical, or
                     academic-related post-holders. Forming such cultures requires leadership,
                     institutional support and a willingness on the part of all participants,
                     irrespective of their individual disciplinary backgrounds, to engage in

               </cit>
               <p>Deeply collaborative work requires a supportive culture, and Cronin suggests that
                  this involves a range of factors. Such factors can contribute to a kind of a
                  conceptual underpinning. The parameters discussed below are more of this
                  conceptual type than directly practical. </p>
               <p>The design parameters under consideration are: mutual respect, the digital
                  humanities as a trading zone, the importance of space, connecting to the
                  disciplines and engaging across multiple modes of engagement, making technology
                  part of the digital humanities, and the field as an arena for innovation and
                  rethinking. Importantly, the parameters function more as a possible target than a
                  presentation of <soCalled>natural</soCalled> qualities of contemporary digital
                  humanities. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <head>Design Parameter: Assume Mutual Respect</head>
               <p>Mutual respect can be seen as a very basic quality, but for that reason, it can
                  sometimes be taken for granted. However, exactly because of its fundamental
                  quality and its importance for interdisciplinary endeavors, such as in the digital
                  humanities, it deserves attention. Indeed, the importance of mutual respect is
                  sometimes pointed out in research on interdisciplinary practice (cf. e.g. <ptr target="#repko2008" loc="44"/>). In any enterprise where you facilitate
                  meetings across traditional boundaries – whether it be across disciplines, across
                  parts of the university, between the university and the outside world, between
                  faculty and technical staff or between faculty and students - explicit mutual
                  respect can help make that boundary crossing easier and more productive. It lowers
                  the threshold to engagement, encourages <soCalled>positive</soCalled> exchange and
                  makes participants more willing to step out of their comfort zone. The sense of an
                  allowing and friendly space does not imply, however, that discussions should not
                  have intellectual edge, that there should not be tension or that everyone has to
                  be overly <soCalled>nice</soCalled> all the time, but rather that there is basic
                  level mutual respect that is fundamental to the operation. Shanks says that <cit>
                     <quote rend="inline" source="#shanks2008">Collaboration does not mean consensus — dissent is good.
                        Enable such a diversity of voice.</quote>
                     <ptr target="#shanks2008"/>
                  </cit> The point is that expressing dissent and having rich collaborative
                  discussions are indeed combinable with mutual respect and <soCalled>being
                     nice</soCalled>.</p>
               <p>For instance, this respect should extend to traditional disciplines and the
                  accumulative work done in these disciplines, as well as the work carried out by
                  new formations. Even when faced with rather provocative issues, such as the future
                  existence of one’s own discipline, many scholars are willing engage in
                  discussions. As a general rule, however, it helps not to be unnecessarily
                  provocative. For instance, cursory dismissal of existing disciplines or particular
                  work practices is not recommended, and excluding people through enforcing your own
                  epistemic commitments is strongly discouraged. </p>
               <p>Mutual respect entails being interested in other people’s research and practice,
                  acknowledging different epistemic traditions, engaging in dialogue and
                  collaborative work regardless of someone’s position in the university hierarchy or
                  other structures, but also respecting more <soCalled>monastic</soCalled> work
                  processes (cf. <ptr target="#manifesto2009" loc="5"/>) and a temporary reluctance
                  to be highly dialogic. As we shall see, carefully designed space – whether mostly
                  physical, mostly digital or mixed – can support both individual practice and
                  collaborative, trading zones <ptr target="#galison1997"/>. One way of addressing
                  this particular contrast is to use translucence as one design principle to allow
                  for multiple zones at the same time (cf. <ptr target="#svensson2011"/>), and thus
                  hopefully making respectful work and rich collaboration easier.</p>

               <head>Design Parameter: Allow the Digital Humanities to be a Trading Zone and Meeting
                  Place</head>
               <p>Most varieties of digital humanities seem to have a core engagement beyond a
                  single discipline or well-defined institutional center. As we saw earlier, this
                  broad engagement is closely related to the visionary scope of the digital
                  humanities. Even when pushing for digital humanities departments on par with other
                  departments, it would seem that the digital humanities rarely is conceived of as a
                  traditional <soCalled>walled</soCalled> department. An important realization is
                  that broad engagement and collaborative practice are not a given but have to be
                  built and supported through institutional, cultural and individual commitment. In
                  the aforementioned Humanist discussion, Cronin points to the importance of
                  building a collaborative culture for the digital humanities <ptr target="#cronin2010"/>.</p>
               <p>In his classical work on knowledge building, Galison introduces the notion of
                  trading zones, which allows him to show that cross-sectional knowledge building
                  requires the identities and practices of individual traditions, and that this
                  tension can be quite productive.</p>
               <cit>
                  <quote rend="block" source="#galison1997">Different finite traditions of theorizing, experimenting,
                     instrument making, and engineering meet – even transform one another – but for
                     all that they do not lose their separate identities and practices. </quote>
                  <ptr target="#galison1997" loc="137"/>
               </cit>
               <p>Such processes operate on multiple levels and relate to aspects of digital
                  humanities such as tool building, understanding of shared digital resources,
                  theory making and the dynamics of the spaces associated with the field. Given that
                  collaborative and interdisciplinary work seems to be characteristic of much of the
                  digital humanities, it would seem tenable to categorize the field as more open and
                  intersectional than many others. There are different types and levels of openness,
                  however, and it could be argued that the digital humanities could make
                     <soCalled>openness</soCalled> a much more central and clearly articulated
                  concept or vision. </p>
               <p>Making the digital humanities an open, inclusive and dynamic meeting place
                  requires commitment and engagement on multiple levels as well as a willingness to
                  be a trading zone. The idea of an open and accessible meeting place is
                  far-reaching, and not necessarily easy to implement in the highly structured and
                  hierarchical system of higher education. Indeed, there is a certain degree of
                  non-permanence, fluidity and resistance to hierarchies associated with such
                  meeting places. Bey talks about temporary autonomous zones to describe the
                  strategy of creating temporary spaces that elude formal structures of control and
                  that are created on the boundary lines of established regions <ptr target="#bey1991"/>. According to Bey, there is a power, intensity and
                  creativity to such territories. An interesting question thus arises: how does the
                  digital humanities position itself in relation to temporal and hierarchical
                  structures, and what is required to create and maintain a functional trading
                  zone?</p>
               <p>On a more practical level, there are a number of factors involved in seeing the
                  digital humanities as a trading zone. For instance, it requires the digital
                  humanities to be comparatively non-territorial and comfortable with existing
                  outside some traditional structures. Finding ways of sharing costs between
                  schools, departments and programs is also often difficult. While being different
                  is problematic in some ways, the possible gains are arguably substantial. It makes
                  broad engagement across and outside the humanities easier; it increases the number
                  of possible interaction points; and it allows the digital humanities to be a
                  laboratory for the humanities. Trading zones do not necessarily stop at
                  departments or schools. Importantly, such zones or meeting places could, and
                  probably should, extend outside the humanities proper to other parts of the
                  university and, if appropriate and mutually beneficial, to industry, cultural
                  institutions and the art world. Arguably, this is a strong possible positioning
                  for the digital humanities.</p>
               <p>We should acknowledge, however, that many, if not most, digital humanities
                  initiatives already engage in a range of activities that can be classified as
                  intersectional. An example would be fellowship programs allowing faculty to do
                  work at the digital humanities center and different types of open seminars and
                  workshops. Multiple affiliation is another example of such a strategy (cf. also
                  the earlier discussion of area studies and the idea of <soCalled>dual
                     citizenship</soCalled>). The underlying rationale is the importance of
                  connecting the digital humanities center with other departments and disciplines,
                  and creating long-term commitments to such exchanges. People with double
                  affiliations can be involved in changing both worlds (i.e. both institutions), and
                  individual people can help forge strong links. On a more particular level, it is
                  important to think carefully about such strategies. Regardless of the extent of
                  the openness of a digital humanities initiative, such strategies can play an
                  important role. This is even more true if they are anchored in a conceptual
                  framework.</p>
               <p>An open meeting place and energetic trading zone does not necessarily make a sharp
                  distinction between research, education and other activities. Indeed, it can be
                  argued that incorporating undergraduate and graduate students as well as
                  researchers, developers and others increases the potential of the trading zone
                  considerably. </p>

               <head>Design Parameter: Care About Space</head>
               <p>Knowledge production, intellectual exchange and development work are spatially
                  situated (cf. <ptr target="#livingstone2003" loc="179"/>, <ptr target="#burke2000" loc="56"/>, <ptr target="#martin2003" loc="183"/>), and arguably space is
                  particularly important to the digital humanities given its often intermediate
                  role, supposedly emergent state, collaborative work practices, and engagement with
                  technology. These spaces may be mostly physical, mostly digital, or mixed.
                  Physical institutional space is typically difficult to come by, and adequate
                  control of the design of such spaces may not be given to the institution supposed
                  to inhabit the space. Digital <soCalled>space</soCalled> is temptingly easier to
                  come by, but no less challenging in terms of design, use, long-term costs and
                  possible constraints and possibilities imposed by the space. </p>
               <p>When planning new initiatives in the digital humanities, consideration should
                  definitely be given to space, and for many enterprises grounded at one university,
                  having a strong physical space can be advantageous. In other cases, regular
                  institutional space or a strong digital space may be more optimal, and the main
                  point of introducing space as a design parameter, is to stress the importance of
                  actively considering space in the context of the digital humanities. In this
                  article series, considerable attention has been given to the idea of having a lab
                  or studio space <ptr target="#svensson2011"/>. This is obviously just
                     <emph>one</emph> possible model, but one that would seem compatible with at
                  least some varieties of the digital humanities (see <ptr target="#earhart2011"/>
                  for a critical discussion). A studio space can bring different kinds of people and
                  competencies together, host (or be) cyberinfrastructure, and help create energy,
                  leverage and <soCalled>buzz</soCalled>. On a more symbolic and political level,
                  such a space can represent and enact the initiative and associated values, become
                  a showcase for the university, and attract visitors.</p>
               <p>In the same way as mostly physical spaces can be seen as reflecting the ideational
                  underpinnings of a digital humanities initiative, digital spaces or platforms can
                  help facilitate the type of work seen as important to the initiative. Some such
                  platforms would be more spatially oriented than others, such as virtual worlds,
                  video-based team software or tools that create an experimental or interpretative
                  space. In any case, while the design of digital platforms and spaces may not be
                  brick and mortar, the associated costs and long-term commitments may be as costly
                  and decisive in terms of establishing certain structures and constraints that will
                  influence how work can be carried out. Again, premeditation and connection with
                  the core values of the initiative are important, as well as engaging with
                  standards, protocols and existing platforms. The fact that most spaces are mixed
                  in one way or another emphasizes the importance of seeing spaces as part of an
                  ecology, where many different components, affordances and considerations help
                  create a sense of conceptual and connectional grounding.</p>

               <head>Design Parameter: Connect to the Heart of the Disciplines and Engage Broadly
                  with the Digital</head>

               <p>The humanities engage with information technology and the digital in many
                  different ways, and it has been suggested in this article series that we can
                  distinguish between technology and the digital serving as a tool, object of
                  analysis, expressive medium, exploratory laboratory and activist venue (see <ptr target="#svensson2009"/>). For a <soCalled>big tent</soCalled> digital
                  humanities, it would seem that a broader engagement with the digital is
                  advantageous as it increases the possible points of interaction between the
                  humanities and the digital, and between the digital humanities and the humanities.
                  It is, however, important that digital humanities initiatives and centers maintain
                  their own status, integrity and mandate to facilitate work in this area, work with
                  faculty from other departments, and help create momentum. Productive exchange and
                  innovative work in intersectional domains are more likely to be successful if the
                  competencies that engage in such domains work together from the very beginning and
                  if there is a sense of equal worth.</p>
               <p>Traditionally, humanities computing has built tools, provided methodological
                  expertise, helped with advanced data management, facilitated project management,
                  etc., for scholars in different humanities disciplines (some disciplines more than
                  others). Such a model may also include fellowship programs that allow faculty from
                  humanities departments to have dedicated time to work with a digitally inflected
                  project (typically technology would serve as a tool in such projects). In terms of
                  impact, it may be argued that such a model probably only reaches a portion of
                  possible humanities scholars and that it does not necessarily connect to the heart
                  of the disciplines – to what really matters to scholars in the disciplinary
                  community. This is particularly true if tool making and use of technology are not
                  deeply embedded in the research process (cf. <ptr target="#drucker2009a"/> and
                     <ptr target="#drucker2009b"/>). The digital humanities arguably need to be
                  about major research challenges, exciting tools, and engaging expression.</p>
               <p>Although the modes of engagement listed above naturally overlap to some extent,
                  there is a risk with a high degree of separation and specialization. The
                  development of critical tools requires intellectual investment and preferably a
                  sense of pushing on the analytical tradition of the involved disciplines. The
                  study of the digital in a broad sense is likely to benefit from the use and
                  development of advanced digital tools and from engagement with technology (see
                     <ptr target="#ross2009"/> for some early examples). It could furthermore be
                  argued that most of the humanities need to consider digital knowledge production
                  (broadly speaking, see <ptr target="#fitzpatrick2009"/>) and the expressive
                  capabilities of digital (and other) media. All digital humanities initiatives will
                  naturally not be exploratory laboratories and activist venues, but it arguably
                  benefits the digital humanities and the humanities to be involved in the active
                  rethinking of the humanities and the academy.</p>
               <p>Looking at it from the point of view of the operations of a digital humanities
                  center, a broad engagement with the digital presumably expands the palette of
                  possible interactions, activities and projects. Moreover, it would seem that such
                  a cross-sectional mix could facilitate a more dynamic and open trading zone. On
                  the other hand, a broad approach becomes less focused and requires care in order
                  to support different epistemic traditions robustly. The gain comes from the
                  possibilities of collaboration and combinability, maximizing possible engagement,
                  and the ability to take on complex research and development challenges
                  convincingly. </p>
               <p>Connecting to the heart of the disciplines involves relating to the core
                  challenges and needs of those disciplines. This does not imply a pronounced
                  service function (cf. <ptr target="#nowviskie2010a"/> and <ptr target="#liu2011"/>) or aligning with disciplinary agendas but rather to be engaged in an
                  intellectual dialogue that sparks core interest among scholars from those
                  disciplines. At the UVA Shape of Things Conference in 2010, Michael Keller of
                  Stanford University brought up the issue of humanistic discourses:</p>
               <cit>
                  <quote rend="block" source="#prescott2010b">
                     <hi rend="bold">Ajprescott:</hi> Keller:what are the new research
                     questions?aThat is fundamental question. We thought we would see new humanistic
                     discourses.Are we? #uvashape</quote>
                  <ptr target="#prescott2010b"/>
               </cit>
               <p>It is suggested that a larger intellectual engagement and involvement in
                  humanistic discourses is easier to achieve with a rich and multi-faceted
                  engagement with the digital. Some disciplines are more likely to engage on the
                  levels of tools whereas others are more likely to engage in relation to
                  interpretative research issues. An expansive and collaborative digital humanities
                  can engage richly across the board and clearly relate to some of the most
                  interesting research and education going on in the disciplines.</p>
               <p>As always, institutional factors and possible leverage vary and depend highly on
                  the local context, but in most cases it would seem likely that a strong, deep and
                  multiple-level connection to the humanities disciplines, and at least a few of the
                  leading scholars there, will strengthen the digital humanities and associated
                  initiatives. This is particularly true if the digital humanities also can maintain
                  integrity and mandate in relation to its own operation and while working with the
                  established departments and disciplines. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <head>Design Parameter: Engage with Technology</head>
               <p>As was noted earlier, engagement with technology is a prerequisite for digital
                  humanities, but it can also be a point of tension between different varieties of
                  digital humanities. It would seem advantageous in many cases, for instance, for
                  the digital humanities not to restrict itself to relate to technology and the
                  digital only as a distant object of study. For more cultural or critical studies
                  approaches, it might be argued that there is value in engaging with technology
                  more directly, and that this can be done without sacrificing analytical rigor.
                  Furthermore, digital media can facilitate alternative modes of representation and
                  expression (cf. <ptr target="#mcpherson2009"/>).</p>
               <p>For more technically oriented varieties of digital humanities, engagement with
                  technology is a more integral part of the operation. Here, critical perspectives
                  on technology are important as well as a humanities based investment in scholarly
                  infrastructure. Interestingly, the engagement of digital humanities is not
                  necessarily reflected in the digital spaces associated with the field. As Terras
                  points out, it is important that the digital humanities represents itself
                  appropriately online given <cit>
                     <quote rend="inline" source="#terras2010">what we do.</quote>
                     <ptr target="#terras2010"/>
                  </cit> Similarly, it could be argued that many physical digital humanities spaces
                  do not manifest the technological investment of the field or, for that matter, the
                  alternative modes of knowledge production or innovation often associated with the
                  digital humanities. This goes far beyond presenting a
                     <soCalled>surface,</soCalled> even if the outward projection is not unimportant
                  and is intrinsically linked to acknowledging the significance of the particulars
                  of actual sites of knowledge production <ptr target="#livingstone2003"/> and of
                  rich material engagement with various modes of <soCalled>the digital</soCalled>.
                  For instance, the aesthetics of scholarly environments, whether digital, physical
                  or mixed, is highly relevant to learning and research processes (cf. <ptr target="#svensson2011"/>). Furthermore, it could be argued that there is
                  considerable value in making technology available to encourage experimentation and
                  to stimulate innovative scholarly uses of a variety of digital technologies.
                  Indeed, digitally supported manifestations would seem natural in relation to the
                  digital humanities, and they also tend to attract collaborative partners from
                  technology and engineering as well as art and design.</p>
               <p>The rigor and deep knowledge associated with humanities computing could be
                  expanded more widely across the landscape of the digital humanities. For instance,
                  there would seem to be considerable potential in such knowledge and innovative
                  tool building in approaches that primarily engage with the digital as a study
                  object. This also means that the digital humanities must be able to align with the
                  contemporary media and technology landscape, and integrate with existing software
                  and hardware systems ranging from social media platforms to high performance
                  computing setups. Such alignment and interest in shaping and experimenting with
                  technology can be an important part of the meeting between humanities-based
                  epistemic traditions and the development of meaningful tools and expressions.</p>
               <p>On a fundamental level, one visionary possibility would be for the digital
                  humanities to be at the forefront of technological development and appropriation
                  in relation to deep disciplinary research challenges. The relation between
                  research questions and technological innovation is not a simple one, and generally
                  speaking, neither starting out solely from the research questions or solely from
                  the technology side of things is tenable. There is a need for iterative and
                  integrated processes, which influences and, to some extent, shapes both the
                  research and the technological development. Such a process must allow for some
                  risk taking and experimentation (we do not always know what specific technologies
                  are good for, if anything), and must be adaptive (the research challenges may
                  change as a result of availability or development of certain methods and
                  technologies) and critically engaged.</p>

               <head>Design Parameter: Digital Humanities as an Arena for Innovation and
                  Rethinking</head>

               <p>As we have seen, the digital humanities often has a reach across the humanities
                  and tends to be different from regular departments and centers in terms of
                  institutional organization, mission, work and self perception. Arguably this
                  position facilitates a platform for innovation in the humanities more generally
                  and can turn the digital humanities into a laboratory or arena for such matters as
                  alternative modes of knowledge production and learning, large-scale collaborative
                  ventures to address substantial intersectional research challenges, and an
                  unapologetic, respectful, visible, proactive and deeply reflective humanities.
                  Indeed, the digital humanities can lead the way. Liu argues that <quote rend="inline" source="#liu2011">the digital humanities will need to show that it can also take a
                     leadership role</quote> and <cit>
                     <quote rend="inline" source="#liu2011">[t]he obvious leadership role at present is service for
                        the cause of the humanities.</quote>
                     <ptr target="#liu2011"/>
                  </cit> This is partly a visionary sentiment, of course, which should ideally be
                  coupled with ground level work and pragmatic implementation. The main point is
                  that the digital humanities can be positioned in such a way that it offers a space
                  for rethinking, experimenting and developing the humanities, and indeed, the
                  university or school. This is <emph>one</emph> possible position, and naturally
                  not the only one that affords possibilities for innovation or first-rate digital
                  humanities work. </p>
               <p>Indeed, the humanities-wide reach and sense of being (or wishing to be) different
                  is not universal for the field. Arguably there is a tendency to further
                  institutionalization in the sense of digital humanities centers becoming
                  departments and hence, presumably, more disciplinary and similar to traditional
                  departments. There are important strategic reasons for such a development
                  including the vulnerable situation of many center-like institutions (cf. <ptr target="#svensson2009"/>), how funding streams and faculty hires are
                  operationalized, as well as how academic identity is created and sustained. There
                  are also predecessors to such a development, as successful interdisciplinary or
                  intersectional academic fields have a tendency over time to become
                  institutionalized with their own disciplines, educational programs and a higher
                  degree of self-reliance (e.g. Asian American Studies, women’s studies and
                  cognitive science). While this in many ways is a reasonable and productive
                  development, there are also advantages to a liminal and non-departmental position.
                  It may help create leverage, collaborative possibilities, a significant role and
                  position within the humanities and for the university, be less of a threat to
                  other departments, and increase the possibility to be involved in the rethinking
                  and changing of both the humanities and the academy. </p>

               <head>A Vision Statement</head>
               <p>I will now end this article series with a vision statement placed within the
                  visionary scope articulated above. This statement is not so much the culmination
                  of the article series as a particular and personal endnote. It only seems
                  appropriate that an article on envisioning the digital humanities ends with a
                  vision.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The digital humanities is a part of the humanities not so much
                     in the sense of being a distinct and separate discipline, but in the sense of
                     interrelating deeply and multifariously with the humanities disciplines. The
                     digital humanities should not only have integrity and independence, but they
                     also need consistently to touch at the heart of the disciplines and engage with
                     major contemporary research challenges and some of the most acknowledged
                     humanities scholars. The digital humanities does not have to work with every
                     scholar or discipline and most initiatives are specific in one way or another,
                     but the field as a whole should be open enough to invite both data heavy
                     projects, encoding methodology and critical theory based analyses. We need to
                     acknowledge that <soCalled>big tent</soCalled> digital humanities draws on
                     multiple epistemic traditions and that finding common ground and language is
                     not trivial. Furthermore, the rhetoric of an expansive digital humanities comes
                     with certain responsibilities and cannot be exclusively mapped on individual
                     traditions in a convincing way. At the same time, inclusion in the field of
                     digital humanities must be based on self-identification and a willingness to
                     engage, although considerable richness comes from continuously attracting
                     scholars who may not initially relate to the digital or the digital humanities.
                     While there is clear value to identifying a field of digital humanities, we
                     need to accommodate a range of organizational relations. Double affiliation is
                     a useful way of maintaining links both to a discipline and the digital
                     humanities. The field, however, is not reliant on departments and disciplines
                     to make <soCalled>things happen</soCalled>. For instance, a digital humanities
                     center may have to create new faculty positions to support a significant area
                     not of immediate interest to the relevant departments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The digital humanities clearly has the power to stimulate
                     visionary and transformative thinking, and it can be a site for innovation,
                     reconfiguration and exploration. This power, which should be acknowledged and
                     valued, comes from the broad and intersectional reach of the digital
                     humanities, a sense of being situated at the periphery and fighting established
                     structures, the non-disciplinary status of the field, and humanities-external
                     interest and acknowledgement. The digital serves as a potent point of
                     canalization for this transformative sentiment, and by proxy, the digital
                     humanities can become a place where the digital, analogue and hybrid humanities
                     can be discussed, negotiated and projected. Again, this will not take place
                     everywhere, but is a significant property of the digital humanities as a
                     project. </hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The digital humanities need to be materially and technologically
                     grounded in order to facilitate the often intertwined practical, expressive and
                     critical work associated with the field. We need to engage deeply and
                     sensitively with digital media and technology in order to shape our own means
                     of knowledge production. A truly humanities-based notion of research
                     infrastructure requires humanists to carefully think through the intellectual
                     challenges and ideational underpinnings of the humanities and individual fields
                     as well as to critically explore technologies and methodologies. Critical work
                     on digitally inflected representation and objects of analysis benefits from
                     real engagement with the digital modalities in question. We need deep knowledge
                     of underlying technologies and methodologies such as text encoding,
                     geographical information systems, physical computing and humanities
                     visualization, as well as expertise in sustainable data modeling and informed
                     information aesthetics. Naturally, the digital humanities cannot and should
                     probably not have all this in-house, but we need to be serious about our
                     material and technological grounding. </hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The digital humanities can serve as a laboratory, innovation
                     agency, portal and collaborative initiator for the humanities, and as a
                     respectful meeting place or trading zone for the humanities, technology and
                     culture, extending across research, education and innovation. This meeting
                     place would normally extend far outside the humanities proper and could include
                     the humanities as well as other academic disciplines, industry and the art
                     world. The digital humanities center (in whatever form) is not dead, nor
                     probably an absolute requirement, but there is clear advantage to an
                     independent role and to having a space. The lab or studio model is one of many
                     but one that has clear advantages worth considering for new digital humanities
                     initiatives. A well-designed and conceptually grounded space, whether mainly
                     physical, digital or necessarily mixed, can help bring people together,
                     instantiate technology, be clearly invitational, support collaborative and
                     processual work practices, and allow ongoing, cross-sectional, and profound
                     dialogue. A physical space can function as a focus of interest and as a
                     showcase, and the digital humanities can be one of the two-three most frequent
                     and popular spots for external high-level (and other level) guests to the
                     university. This gives the added benefit of the provost or university president
                     being informed about the current state of affairs in the digital humanities on
                     a regular basis, and it challenges us to talk freshly and intensely about the
                     future of the field, significant scholarly challenges, and some of the most
                     exciting trajectories of the humanities.</hi>

            <head>Conclusion</head>
            <p>As this article has shown, the digital humanities is intimately connected with
               different kinds of visionary and forward-looking discourses. These discourses can
               tell us a great deal about an expanding and shifting field, its considerable
               international variation, as well as tensions due to different epistemic traditions
               and sets of hopes. The digital humanities can serve an important function in
               providing a means to think about the state and future of the humanities, as well as
               the digital humanities more specifically. Such thinking need not be all-pervasive,
               overly utopian or ungrounded, but must be forward-looking and, arguably,
                  <soCalled>large</soCalled>. </p>
