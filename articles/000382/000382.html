                  <p>The fate of the medieval Aesop during the early age of print reveals the tensions
                     that arise between <em class="emph">corporeal</em> and <em class="emph">proprietary</em> understandings
                     of artistic production. Building upon the highly accumulative, various, and
                     expandable Aesopic tradition that thrived in the Middle Ages within scholastic
                     manuscripts, the fifteenth-century fables of Robert Henryson and William Caxton
                     confront movements to consolidate and transform Aesop’s sprawling literary corpus
                     into a singular printable property. At the same time that a single series of Aesop’s
                     fables, now known as the <cite class="title italic">elegiac Romulus</cite>, became
                     increasingly standardized within printed books, woodcut illustrations and textual
                     descriptions increasingly beautified Aesop’s body, transforming him from an
                     inarticulate slave to an eloquent aristocrat. The simultaneous metamorphosis of
                     Aesop’s poetic and visual corpus reveals the premodern underpinnings for current
                     efforts by publishing industries to immunize digital work from rogue acts of
                     appropriation, mashup, and remix, practices which had previously defined Aesopic
                     textuality. As a response to this textual vulnerability, the collapse of Aesopic work
                     into a singular entity reimagines the allegorical relationship between the author
                     or
                     publisher and the work as proprietary, not corporeal. Rather than an extension of
                     a
                     generative, deeply somatic, and grotesque process of multiple fabular authors and
                     commentators, the modernized Aesop obtains value as a “property,”
                     paving the way for the notion that creative corpuses can be
                     “owned,” effectively stealing away corporeal features from
                     intellectual production.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1"> Perhaps the most overwhelming aspect of digital writing is its vulnerability to all
                     kinds of intellectual theft, from illicit copying to database hacking. While the
                     threats to artistic autonomy and intellectual property are significant, many forms
                     of
                     digital appropriation are undeniably innovative, creative, and valuable. Even if we
                     set aside the privacy/security debates surrounding efforts to make information
                     transparent, especially given the volatile responses to WikiLeaks and Edward Snowden,
                     we can recognize the artistic potential of hacking, which often results in stunning
                     music remixes and viral video mashups. The result, of course, has led to much
                     handwringing, especially from self-interested corporations crying foul over
                     violations of copyright [<a class="ref" href="#lessig2005">Lessig 2005</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#vaidhyanathan2003">Vaidhyanathan 2003</a>]. Yet, such artistic acts of appropriation have
                     become so “cool” that they have led scholars such as Alan Liu to
                     suggest that “[s]trong art will be about the
                     ‘destruction of destruction’ or, put another way, the
                     recognition of the destructiveness of creation”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#liu2004">Liu 2004</a>, 9]. Within the digital world, such a neo-avant garde aesthetics of destruction
                     has fostered an environment of textual vulnerability, in which texts are, radically,
                     at the will of their users.

                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p2"> At the same time, it is crucial to acknowledge that such an emphasis on
                     “creative destruction” can lead to an uncritical acceptance of
                     all forms of “innovation,” one of the most powerful euphemisms for
                     capitalistic enterprise. As Joseph A. Schumpeter pointed out in 1943, the desire for
                     new markets leads to “industrial
                     mutation,” part of what he later calls a “perennial gale of creative destruction” that “incessantly revolutionizes the
                     economic structure <em class="emph">from within</em>, incessantly destroying the old
                     one, incessantly creating a new one”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#schumpeter1994">Schumpeter 1994</a>, 83]. This phoenix-like logic, in which a new power rises from the ashes of the
                     old, also undergirds medieval theories of sovereignty – what is often referred to
                     as
                     <span class="foreign i">translatio imperii</span>, or the translation of power
                     from one civilization to the next [<a class="ref" href="#mueller2013">A. Mueller 2013</a>, 3–4]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#robinson1997">Robinson 1997</a>]. Histories of imperialism teach us that such an
                     optimistic view of destruction often serves the interests of the elite who benefit
                     from such “innovation” while disenfranchising others, especially
                     those cultures or industries that have been “mutated” or
                     “superseded.” Liu turns to the writings of the Critical Art
                     Ensemble (CAE), as an example of neo-avant-garde collective that will use their
                     technical skills of “disturbance” and
                     “hacktivism” as a means to disrupt
                     these forces of exclusion, but even the CAE adopts the elitist logic of creative
                     destruction by claiming that “the only groups that will successfully
                     confront power are those that locate the arena of contestation in cyberspace,
                     and hence an elite force seems to be the best possibility”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#liu2004">Liu 2004</a>, 367]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#cae1996">Critical Art Ensemble 1996 </a>]. As Patricia Ingham warns in her recent book, <cite class="title italic">The Medieval New</cite>, such an embrace of complete destruction
                     and confrontation means that “we have bought
                     entirely the notion that innovation lays waste to what has come before,” as
                     opposed to the practices of “ambivalent
                     <span class="foreign i">homage</span>” that define many medieval
                     perspectives on innovation [<a class="ref" href="#ingham2015">Ingham 2015</a>, 14].

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3"> In this essay, I argue for the importance of understanding the politics and ethics
                     of medieval forms of appropriation, which are rarely acts of destruction and more
                     often premodern forms of sampling, remix, and mashup, which rely on degrees of
                     “homage” to ancient authorities. As Kathleen Kennedy has
                     demonstrated in her book, <cite class="title italic">Medieval Hackers</cite>, we encounter
                     early evidence of “hacker culture”
                     during the later Middle Ages when governmental, educational, and ecclesiastical
                     institutions attempted to control information [<a class="ref" href="#kennedy2015">Kennedy 2015</a>, 4].
                     Reactions to these forms of control varied, but graduates of medieval schools had
                     already been trained to appropriate texts critically, a practice many of them learned
                     in their writing exercises, which emphasized citation and reuse of existing
                     authorities. While the salience of this point could be made with the commentary
                     traditions of a number of theological texts, such as the <cite class="title italic">Glossa
                        Ordinaria</cite>
                     [<a class="ref" href="#saloman2012">Saloman 2012</a>], or legal books, such as the <cite class="title italic">Decretum</cite>
                     [<a class="ref" href="#winroth2004">Winroth 2004</a>], I have selected one canon of pedagogical texts, Aesop’s
                     fables, as a representative example for analysis. These animal tales are known for
                     their moral lessons, but they were primarily utilized in medieval classrooms for
                     reading and writing instruction. Students and teachers would insert interlineal
                     glosses, usually Latin synonyms, to challenge their expanding vocabulary and then
                     rewrite these fables, both in abbreviated and elaborated forms. Most crucially,
                     though, students and teachers appended extensive commentaries to fables in their
                     manuscripts, which regularly occupied more space on the page then the fables
                     themselves. These rhetorical amplifications often became acts of appropriation,
                     revisions of fables that bear the names of Aesopic authors that range from Avianus
                     to
                     Walter of England to Robert Henryson.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4"> Within the context of 21<span class="hi superscript">st</span> century copyright law, this
                     combination of critical commentary and literary “theft” challenges
                     current understandings of “fair use.” As Robin Wharton has demonstrated about
                     the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit’s decision in <cite class="title italic">Suntrust Bank v. Houghton Mifflin</cite>, 286 F.3d 1257 [<a class="ref" href="#suntrust2001">Suntrust Bank v. Houghton Mifflin 2001</a>], interpretations of copyright have begun to separate
                     literary “critique” from “creative” work [<a class="ref" href="#wharton2013">Wharton 2013</a>, 32–8]. In an attempt to distinguish parody from satire as a literary genre
                     that falls within fair use, the court in <cite class="title italic">Suntrust</cite>
                     determined that “[a] parody is a work that seeks to
                     comment upon or criticize another work by appropriating elements of the
                     original. ‘Parody needs to mimic an
                     original to make its point, and so has some claim to use the creation of its
                     <span class="hi italic">victim’s (or collective victims’)</span>
                     imagination’”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#suntrust2001">Suntrust Bank v. Houghton Mifflin 2001</a>]. Revisions of medieval fables also incorporated commentaries within their
                     elaborations on the Aesopic imagination, but the result was hardly parodic and the
                     previous fables were rarely victims of critique. Rather, new fables became new
                     members attached to the Aesopic corpus, a ceaselessly expandable body of fabular work
                     composed by innumerable Aesopic authors and commentators. As the fable traditions
                     begin to appear in print, we see acts of “hacking” emerge in the
                     form of mashups and remixes of fables – an especially poignant phenomenon in the
                     printed life of Henryson’s <cite class="title italic">Morall Fabillis</cite>. Within these
                     early printed contexts, we see striking evidence of critical appropriation, in which
                     printers and readers remix fables for new audiences, all the while paying
                     “ambivalent <span class="foreign i">homage</span>” to their
                     origins. In this essay, I ultimately want to suggest that a premodern orientation
                     toward intellectual bodies, instead of properties, may produce more responsible uses,
                     critiques, and reuses of artistic work and ultimately offer formidable challenges
                     to
                     self-interested uses of copyright law, as well as idealistic fantasies of a
                     “creative commons.”

                     elaborated upon Aesop’s fables in extensive commentaries that subsequent readers
                     could associate with other classroom texts and extend through marginal and
                     interlineal glosses. After the twelfth century, the fable series known as the <cite class="title italic">elegiac Romulus</cite> became the canonical “Aesop,” which students and their teachers paraphrased and expanded through
                     extensive glosses that accumulated in manuscripts and early printed books. The <cite class="title italic">elegiac Romulus</cite> was composed of sixty verse fables that
                     survive in at least 170 manuscripts and fifty printed editions published in five
                     countries by the end of the fifteenth century [<a class="ref" href="#hervieux1960">Hervieux 1960</a>, 1:472]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#dicke1987">Dicke and Grubmüller 1987</a>, lxvi–lxviii]. Because of the popularity of this
                     Aesopic corpus, the textual spaces that housed this fable series became read-write

                     stretching the limits of what we now call “intellectual property.”

                     did not emerge until 1624, when the English Parliament approved an act to prevent
                     commercial monopolies and enhance the Crown’s power over the issuing of patents [<a class="ref" href="#johns2010">Johns 2010</a>, 28]. And it was not until 1666 that booksellers
                     embraced the language of authorial “property” in their defense
                     against royalist claims that the Stationer encouraged piracy against the Crown. The
                     booksellers and printers collectively argued that “the Author of every manuscript or
                     copy hath (in all reason) as good right thereunto, as any Man hath to the
                     Estate wherein he has the most absolute property”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#booksellers1666">The case of the booksellers and printers 1666</a>]. Rather than allow the Crown to destroy the Stationer and its control over the
                     registry of printings, this statement empowered authors to sell the rights of their
                     works over to booksellers. As Adrian Johns contends, “This may be the earliest explicit
                     articulation of the idea of literary property – of an absolute right generated
                     by authorship, which could serve as the cornerstone of an entire moral and
                     economic system of print. Certainly the idea had no clear precedent behind
                     it”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#johns2010">Johns 2010</a>, 38]. For contemporaries unfamiliar with the Crown’s attempted publication
                     land-grab, such a statement must have been stunning in its hyperbolic claims to
                     written work as property. This statement is also striking in its advocacy for
                     authors, not printers or booksellers. As Rebecca Curtin has pointed out, early
                     printers were occasionally willing to engage in “alternative transactions,” granting privileges to
                     authors in order to encourage them to enter the book market, a situation that she
                     claims has been replicated within open source software sharing movements in recent
                     decades [<a class="ref" href="#curtin2014">Curtin 2014</a>, 136].

                  <div class="ptext" id="p7">Johns is likely correct that no explicit precedent exists for the printers and
                     booksellers’ statement of 1666, but the transformation of the understanding of the
                     book as a <span class="foreign i">corpus</span> to the book as a <span class="foreign i">locus</span>, particularly for the medieval Aesop, in the
                     preceding centuries suggests that the groundwork was already being prepared for such
                     a claim. Quite literally, of course, the medieval book was a body with leaves of
                     sheepskin, bound around a spine with animal glue, and enclosed with calfskin leather
                     [<a class="ref" href="#walker2013">Walker 2013</a>, 8]. Figuratively, the body played a central role
                     in the medieval imagination, a role that Guillemette Bolens divides into two types:
                     contained bodies and articulated bodies. Within the articulation model, bodies are
                     designed for motion with limbs connected by joints – suggesting the potentiality of
                     movement that can only be severed through destruction or mutilation, such as
                     Beowulf’s wresting of Grendel’s arm from its socket [<a class="ref" href="#bolens2000">Bolens 2000</a>, 145–81]. This dynamic view of corporeality was an alternative to the
                     containment model, in which the body’s outer layer would both define the body and
                     prevent penetration from outside forces, such as weapons, poisons, or corruptions.
                     This corporeal envelope was often understood to include protective or concealing
                     clothing, such as skin, armor, or sacred garb [<a class="ref" href="#young1993">Young 1993</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#rubin1994">Rubin 1994</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#cohen2003">Cohen 2003</a>]. The culture of books, in turn, provides its own rigorous
                     structure of containment, words alphabetized and contained within the limited space
                     of leaves of paper or parchment, selected folios bound together in discrete codices,
                     held within bookcases within libraries. This containment model is continuous from
                     the
                     Middle Ages into the Renaissance and beyond, but as Paul Zumthor and Jan-Dirk Müller
                     have argued, books began to shed their corporeal natures shortly after the arrival
                     of
                     the printing press [<a class="ref" href="#zumthor1987">Zumthor 1987</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#m%C3%BCller1994">Müller 1994</a>]. As Johns points out, the threat of piracy compelled
                     early printers to protect their industry by enclosing it within the moral comfort
                     of
                     domestic spaces: “A printing house was to be a printing
                     <em class="emph">house</em>. At one point the law actually stipulated expressly that
                     presswork could only be done at home. The idea was that activities carried out
                     in a patriarchal household partook of the moral order implicit in that
                     place”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#johns2010">Johns 2010</a>, 27]. Once books became associated more often with a <span class="foreign i">locus</span> than a <span class="foreign i">corpus</span>, they became ripe
                     for the proprietary appropriations that would crescendo after the seventeenth
                     century.

                     of articulation, so much so that he serves cooked animal tongues to dinner guests
                     [<a class="ref" href="#lenaghan1967">Lenaghan 1967</a>, 43–44]. By giving his animal protagonists human
                     tongues, he essentially reverses their fate, engaging in an allegorical fantasy of
                     monstrous speech. And, according to one young medieval reader, even this uncontained
                     <span class="foreign i">corpus</span> – and by proxy his schoolmaster – was
                     subject to the figural violence of its students. An annotation to the explicit in

                     “piratical” acts of resistance designed to appropriate, mashup,

                     body, it is helpful to consider the following fable, whose unorthodox message and
                     textual afterlife epitomize the corporeal nature of Aesopica. Here is a summary of
                     the tale: Late one evening, while guarding the bodies of criminals hanging from
                     crosses, a soldier overhears the pitiful cries of a woman distraught by the death
                     of
                     her husband. Despite the king’s warning that the theft of the crucified corpses would
                     result in the death of the guard on watch, the soldier, unable to resist his
                     attraction to the beautiful widow, relinquishes his post to comfort and feed her.
                     Seduced by this compassionate gesture, she embraces the soldier and they copulate
                     over her husband’s tomb. When he resumes his watch, he discovers to his dismay that
                     one of the bodies has been stolen. The widow is so moved by his earlier kindness to
                     her that she tells him, “Malo mortuum
                     impendere quam vivum occidere” [I would prefer to hang a dead man than kill
                     a living one], offering to substitute the body of her dead husband for the missing
                     criminal [<a class="ref" href="#mueller1995">K. Mueller 1995</a>, 112.7–8]. At her urging, they remove the
                     husband's corpse from his tomb and hang it on the cross in the criminal’s place (<a href="#figure01">fig. 1</a>).

                     was exhumed, reshaped, and incorporated into other literary traditions. We may
                     recognize this story as the “Matron of Ephesus” from the
                     <cite class="title italic">Satyricon</cite>, Petronius’ first century C.E. satire of
                     Roman excess, but the tale was more frequently known throughout the Middle Ages as
                     a
                     standard fable in the <cite class="title italic">elegiac Romulus</cite>

                     [<a class="ref" href="#wheatley1999">Wheatley 1999</a>]. This is surprising because we can identify next to
                     nothing Aesopic in this one, which contains nary a talking non-human animal and
                     includes lascivious content that cannot be easily moralized. While the <cite class="title italic">elegiac Romulus</cite> emerged as the predominant pedagogical
                     series of fables and the basis for one popular printed version, known as the <cite class="title italic">Esopus moralizatus</cite>, the number of variations of each fable
                     and their commentaries suggest that the medieval fable corpus had been extensively
                     revised and re-allegorized [<a class="ref" href="#wright2001">Wright 2001</a>, xxiii]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#wright1998">Wright 1998</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#cramer1995">Cramer 1995</a>]. One reader of this fable, for example, was dissatisfied
                     with the notion that the widow’s husband would not have been discovered to be a
                     different corpse from that of the stolen criminal. To correct this <span class="foreign i">non sequitur</span>, this commentator revised the tale, adding a
                     new scene in which the guard recalls that the criminal did not have any teeth,
                     motivating the compliant widow to grab a stone nearby and smash out the teeth from
                     her dead husband’s mouth [<a class="ref" href="#hervieux1960">Hervieux 1960</a>, 2:341n1]. This revision
                     is simply one example, which suggests that these fables were considered to be
                     flexible works in progress, ripe for correction and appropriation, rather than
                     finished products to be consumed “as is.”

                  <div class="ptext" id="p11"> Following the pioneering work of Paul Zumthor, medievalists have tended to
                     characterize such textual malleability as <em class="term">mouvance</em> or variance in an
                     effort to distinguish the dynamic volatility of manuscript culture from the alleged
                     fixity of print culture [<a class="ref" href="#zumthor1972">Zumthor 1972</a>]. Even scholars working outside
                     of medieval studies in the 1980s, such as Gerald Bruns, began to make stark
                     distinctions between “the closed text of a print culture and
                     the open text of a manuscript culture”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#bruns1982">Bruns 1982</a>, 44]. Bernard Cerquiglini famously used the strongest terms, claiming that “l’écriture médiévale ne produit pas de
                     variants, elle est variance” [medieval writing does not produce variants;
                     it is variance.] [<a class="ref" href="#cerquiglini1989">Cerquiglini 1989</a>, 111]. Such an emphasis on the
                     radical elusiveness and multiplicity of texts within manuscript culture encouraged
                     medievalists to revise their editorial procedures, sometimes eschewing emendation
                     altogether, in an effort to better represent the often untidy experience of reading
                     a
                     medieval text. This movement was marked in 1990 by a special issue in <cite class="title italic">Speculum</cite> devoted to “The New Philology,” in which
                     contributors, led by Stephen Nichols, critiqued their predecessors’ “preoccupation with scholarly exactitude based
                     on edited and printed texts” and embraced “the representation of the past which
                     went along with medieval manuscript culture: adaptation or <span class="foreign i">translatio</span>, the continual rewriting of past works in
                     a variety of versions, a practice which made even the copying of medieval works
                     an adventure in supplementation rather than faithful imitation”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#nichols1990">Nichols 1990</a>, 2–3]. This was a welcome paradigm shift for many medievalists, but it unfortunately
                     led to simplifications and exaggerations about the supposed
                     “static” or “exact” nature of print culture.
                     As Leah Price has pointed out, it even led to some convenient McLuhanism, which
                     allowed scholars, <span class="foreign i">pace</span> Bruns, to make essentialist
                     claims about the nature of print, rather than historicize particular developments
                     within the multiple print eras, from movable type to mass production [<a class="ref" href="#price2006">Price 2006</a>, 14]. In particular, it is clear that early printers
                     continued to consider carefully variance and the difficulty of representing multiple
                     textual traditions, leaving space for reader involvement by allowing marginal space
                     for commentary and appending errata lists for correction. And as Daniel Wakelin has
                     recently shown, scribes and readers of the later Middle Ages were often quite
                     invested in emending manuscripts, making sure that variance did not undermine the
                     authority of their projects [<a class="ref" href="#wakelin2014">Wakelin 2014</a>].

                     environment. Nor do I think it is useful to distinguish the types of Aesopic
                     authorship according to the stark Bonaventuran categories of scribe, compiler,
                     commentator, and author [<a class="ref" href="#minnis2009">Minnis 2009</a>, 94–5]. As Matthew Fisher has
                     suggested, Bonaventure offers this fourfold schema within a sacred tradition of
                     theological commentary, not as a taxonomy for understanding medieval textuality more
                     broadly, which is how it has been too often applied [<a class="ref" href="#fisher2012">Fisher 2012</a>, 71–2]. Within literary and historical manuscripts, the identities of
                     scribe, compiler, commentary, and author often become irretrievably blurred and
                     incapable of being reduced to these categories.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p13">I want to suggest, instead, that Aesopic practices of fable revision and exegetical
                     allegorization are premodern examples of the now pervasive digital practice of
                     remixing. While remixing practices typically refer to music sampling and compilations
                     of previously recorded material, the aesthetics of remixing draws on the allegorical
                     logic of medieval school texts, of which Aesopica serves as an exemplar, or the
                     musical “master” recording so to speak. While there are various
                     kinds of sampling, such as the extended remix (i.e. an elaborated version of an
                     original track), Aesopic textuality is most aptly characterized by what Eduardo Navas
                     calls “reflexive” remixing, which “allegorizes and extends the aesthetic of
                     sampling, where the remixed version challenges the ‘spectacular aura’ of
                     the original and claims autonomy even when it carries the name of the
                     original”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#navas2012">Navas 2012</a>, 60]. To establish a distinction between what he calls the “original” and its remix, Navas invokes Walter
                     Benjamin’s conception of the “aura”
                     or cult authority of an art object, which is increasingly eliminated through new
                     forms of mechanical reproduction [<a class="ref" href="#benjamin1968">Benjamin 1968</a>, 221]. Unlike
                     Benjamin, who views the liquidation of the aura (or the destruction of art’s “ritual” value) as the creation of
                     art’s political potentiality [<a class="ref" href="#benjamin1968">Benjamin 1968</a>, 224], however, Navas
                     suggests that the reflexive remix recognizes AND challenges the authority of the aura
                     through allegory [<a class="ref" href="#navas2012">Navas 2012</a>, 67].

                  <div class="ptext" id="p14">Such acts of appropriation and sampling have been characterized by Alan Liu as “destructive creativity,” a kind of
                     neo-avant-garde aesthetics that responds to the neoliberal push for constant
                     innovation through acts of “creative destruction”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#liu2004">Liu 2004</a>, 317–71]. This is an attractive way of understanding the subversive value of remixing,
                     but such a destructive artistic disposition reflects an antipathy to the past that
                     effaces the history of art objects and undermines the force and function of a remix.
                     After all, acts of sampling and remixing gain power through their ability to preserve
                     the material they are reconstructing, their facility to expose their sources at the
                     same time that they are appropriating and revising them. If a source is destroyed,
                     it
                     becomes unrecognizable, thereby evacuating its potency as an “act of ambivalent <span class="foreign i">homage</span>.” This is the creative and constructive process that
                     describes the medieval development of the beast fable corpus, which clings to the
                     aura of Aesop, all the while expanding the collection through elaborations,
                     additions, and variations under other names such as Phaedrus, Avianus, and Walter
                     of

                     of popular books, songs, or movies, have been produced for decades behind the closed
                     doors of publishing houses, music studios, and film editing rooms, but the emergence
                     of read-write platforms such as blogs and wikis render such textual and visual
                     mashups much more visible. As Martin Irvine has astutely observed, remix “has become a convenient metaphor for a
                     mode of production assumed (incorrectly) to be specific to our post-postmodern
                     era and media technologies (though with some earlier
                     ‘precursors’), and usually limited to describing features
                     of cultural artifacts as ‘outputs’ of software processes
                     (especially in music, video, and photography”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#irvine2014">Irvine 2014</a>, 15]. Rather than limit remixing to materials and genres, Irvine proposes a
                     semiotic model, drawing on the work of C.S. Peirce, to demonstrate the generative,
                     dialogic, and recursive nature of all meaning making. If we accept remixing as
                     inherent to all types of expression, “then the <em class="emph">material form</em> of
                     an expression appears as a <em class="emph">moment of orchestrated combinatoriality</em>
                     in the ongoing interpretive, collective, meaning-making processes that
                     necessarily precede and follow it”
                      (<a href="#irvine2014">Irvine 2014, 33 [italics are mine]</a>). Aesopic fables and commentary, as they appear within particular manuscripts
                     and printed books, operate as orchestrated compilations, which both recognize and
                     challenge its predecessors, inviting future readers to do the same. Irvine suggests
                     that his semiotic model for remix “can counter misrecognitions about
                     original authorship and proprietary artifacts that sustain copyright law and
                     confuse the popular understanding of Remix as something outside the normative
                     and necessary structures of meaning-making in ordinary, daily
                     expression”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#irvine2014">Irvine 2014</a>, 33]. For Irvine, our obsessions with copyright and ownership are based on
                     erroneous conceptions about artistic originality and intellectual property, which
                     undermine remixing as a creative act.

                     been impossible without the capacity to remix previous textual corpora. And in at
                     least one sense, “mixing” and “appropriation” have always been central
                     values of fable writing and reading. Take for instance the opening lines of the
                     standard prologue to the <cite class="title italic">elegiac Romulus</cite>, which employs
                     horticultural language to express the ways in which fables are composed and then used
                     by their readers: “This present work ventures to be
                     pleasurable and useful; serious things are more alluring when they are
                     embellished with sport [Dulcius arrident seria picta iocis]. This garden brings
                     forth fruit with flowers. The flower and the fruit win favor, the one by its
                     flavor and the other by its beauty. If the fruit pleases you more than the
                     flower, select [lege] the fruit; if the flower more than the fruit, select the
                     flower; if both, take [carpe] both”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#busdraghi2005">Busdraghi 2005</a>, 1–6].<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e786">[2]</a> This textual enterprise mixes the serious with the playful, and more
                     precisely the serious “embellished” by the playful. The Latin used
                     here is “picta,” which would normally refer to something “painted,”
                     implying that the sport inherent in fable telling serves as a veneer for what lies
                     underneath. Yet, the fruit (the serious message) is not privileged over the flower
                     (the aesthetic attributes of the fables). Instead, the fabulist uses the verbs
                     “lege” [select] and “carpe” [take] to explain what readers might do to
                     the fable text, taking either the fruit or the flower, or both. While we might expect
                     that readers would select particular aspects of a text to take away, the writer
                     perceives the material as an open source, in which “both” or “all” may be
                     taken. This acknowledgement of the entirety and variety of produce that might be
                     harvested from the text suggests that appropriation is a textual act expected of the
                     fable reader.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p17"> One reader who embraced this fable thievery was Robert Henryson. In his own version
                     of the Romulan prologue, Henryson offers the following line, translated almost
                     directly from his source: “And clerkis
                     sayis, it is richt profitabill / Amangis ernist to ming ane merie sport”
                     [And clerks say that it is very profitable to mix merry sport amongst serious things]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#fox1981">Fox 1981</a>, 20–21]. By claiming that he learned this mantra from
                     “clerkis,” he characterizes the
                     <cite class="title italic">elegiac Romulus</cite> as a collection collaboratively
                     compiled by a number of unnamed authorities. Perhaps more interestingly, he alters
                     the relationship between “sport” and “ernist” [serious things] slightly,
                     moving away from the Latin “seria picta iocis,” or “sport painted upon serious
                     matter,” towards a more balanced “mix,” the result of Henryson’s “to ming.” He appears to endorse
                     appropriation and remixing as characteristics of fable writing, but his next use of
                     “ming” a few lines later is
                     accompanied by a direct citation of a singular authority.

                     his fabular object and reflexively remixes his source material, distilling the vast
                     number of compilators and commentators who contributed to the <cite class="title italic">elegiac Romulus</cite> into the authority of a single author.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p18">On the one hand, it was conventional to cite Aesop as the origin for fables, but on
                     the other, Henryson had just attributed the sentiment of mixing “merry sport amongst serious things” to anonymous
                     “clerkis.” Aesop was a
                     particularly elusive author to pin down since he was considered to be the singular
                     progenitor of beast fables, all the while performing the “author-function” for a
                     host of fabular authors and commentators. Even though the phenomenon of hanging a
                     corpus on the name of an <span class="foreign i">auctor</span>, such as Cato, was
                     fairly common among medieval school authors, even Cato’s <cite class="title italic">Distichs</cite> was not attributable to other identifiable authors in the ways
                     that beast fables were associated with multiple Aesopic authors such as Phaedrus and
                     Avianus [<a class="ref" href="#huygens1970">Huygens 1970 </a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#minnis1988">Minnis and Scott 1988</a>].<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e896">[3]</a> In an act of excessive homage, Henryson
                     recites three different versions of the same Romulan phrase within the space of ten
                     lines. In the first instance, he offers a fairly faithful rendering of the aphorism,
                     making just one significant substitution: rather than translate “dulcius” as
                     “sweeter” or “more alluring,” he selects “richt profitabill” [very
                     profitable], which privileges the moral profit of the fables over their aesthetic
                     delights. The second version, however, offers a more qualified perspective than the
                     first: rather than suggest that any kind of frivolity may be mixed with serious
                     things, he tweaks it slightly, saying “With sad materis sum merines to ming” [to mix some merriments with solemn
                     matters]. As if he is dissatisfied with either translation, his third version is the
                     original Latin line itself: “Dulcius
                     arrident seria picta iocis.” While this kind of translation and citation
                     might seem egregiously repetitive, this redundancy reflects the redundant nature of
                     many fable collections, which offered multiple versions of the same fable in the same
                     manuscript [<a class="ref" href="#codex303">Codex Vindobonensis Palatinus 303</a>].<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e933">[4]</a> Henryson may
                     have been influenced by his immersion in this pedagogical tradition, but it is also
                     important to note that his three renderings of the line cleverly mimic the three
                     levels of appropriation encouraged by the Romulan prologue: selecting one, or
                     selecting another, or taking the whole thing. Understood this way, Henryson first
                     takes the fruit, next takes the flower, and then, having decided he wants them both,
                     he takes both, offering his own remix of the Aesopic mantra.

                     Aesop, who attempted to codify their editions through compilation, or what could be
                     likened to the digital mashup. Within remix culture, the mashup is an aesthetic mode
                     that combines two or more discrete and recognizable artistic products (e.g. images,
                     sounds, words) to extend or elaborate upon their meaning or significance. One of the

                     </div> To begin to comprehend the peculiar nature of this copied/adapted
                     illustration, a brief summary of the fable is in order: The narrator, happening upon
                     a flock of birds gathering around a swallow perched in a hawthorn tree, hides behind
                     a hedge to listen to their conversation. Warning fellow birds to dig up the hempen
                     seed that a fowler has just sown, the swallow predicts that these seeds will
                     eventually become the rope that the fowler will use to fashion a net, which he will
                     then use to catch and kill the birds that feed on the crops. Mocking the swallow’s
                     prudence, the birds ignore her advice and allow the seeds to germinate in the soil.
                     A
                     year passes and the narrator returns to the scene to find the seeds have now sprouted
                     short stalks, which the swallow again implores the birds to pull up. Spurning her
                     counsel once again, the birds allow the stalks to grow to full bloom, until the
                     fowler harvests them to construct a net. He places the net on the ground and casts
                     fresh seed for the birds to eat. For the third time the swallow warns the birds, but
                     they greedily devour the new seed as the fowler catches them up in his net and kills
                     them. Henryson offers an allegory for this fable, in which the swallow represents
                     a
                     preacher, who warns his flock (the birds) against the entrapments of the devil (the
                     fowler).

                     allegorical elements of the fable. This conflation might seem appropriate for a genre
                     heavily inflected by allegory, but this combination of two interpretive modes is
                     actually a radical departure from the standard image that would accompany this fable,
                     which depicts the fowler casting seed in view of the swallow and the birds (<a href="#figure03">fig. 3</a>).

                     Aesopic figures. Navas defines the reflexive mashup as a “form [that] uses samples from two or more
                     elements to access specific information more efficiently, thereby taking them
                     beyond their initial possibilities”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#navas2012">Navas 2012</a>, 93]. To understand how this illustration operates as a reflexive mashup, the

                     striking and complicated image in the Harley illustration. While the preaching figure
                     matches exactly the preacher in Bassandyne’s frontispiece, Bassandyne’s preacher
                     differs significantly from Steinhöwel’s statuesque man atop the pedestal that
                     occupies the same position on the page. We know this figure to be Aesop because many
                     of the images represented in Steinhöwel’s frontispiece refer directly to scenes in
                     the <cite class="title italic">Vita Aesopi</cite> that commonly prefaced fable collections
                     after the thirteenth century and served as the source for Caxton’s <cite class="title italic">Aesop</cite>. The episode in question, in which the Babylonian King
                     constructs a statue in Aesop’s honor, is also illustrated in one of Steinhöwel’s
                     other woodcuts (<a href="#figure06">fig. 6</a>), as is the case for most of the
                     images that appear in the frontispiece.

                        </div>
                     </div> In this sense, this titular collage of Aesopic images serves as a visual
                     index for the illustrations to come. We can easily imagine, for example, a hypertext
                     version of the frontispiece, in which the viewer would click the images to gain
                     access to episodes in the life of Aesop. Henryson’s fables, however, do not include
                     the <cite class="title italic">Vita Aesopi</cite>, making the Bassandyne frontispiece a
                     partial homage (or an orphaned link, if you will) to Steinhöwel’s woodcuts. The
                     preacher in the pulpit-pedestal, which appears to originate in the Bassandyne
                     edition, complicates this reflexive relationship to the Steinhöwel frontispiece and
                     recasts Aesop on the pedestal as a preacher, who will appear in a remediated form
                     in
                     the “Preaching of the Swallow” fable that appears in
                     Henryson’s collection. The Harley illustrator, by contrast, viewed the titular
                     collage less as a set of premodern hyperlinks to prior or subsequent Aesopic texts
                     than as raw material to be “photo-shopped” for a new use. In the
                     case of Henryson’s fable, the actual appearance of Aesop at a pulpit-pedestal would
                     have seemed entirely appropriate, particularly because of his direct invocation at
                     the outset of the <span class="foreign i">moralitas</span>, in which he is
                     described as a “nobill clerk . . . [a]ne
                     poet worthie to be lawreate” [noble clerk . . . a poet worthy to be a
                     laureate] who composed this fable for “gude morall edificatioun” [good moral edification] [<a class="ref" href="#fox1981">Fox 1981</a>, 1893]. The tension identified earlier in Henryson’s prologue – between
                     fables produced by many anonymous clerks and a singular Aesop – emerges again, this
                     time in a vexed attempt to cast laurels on the fable. This shift in textual authority
                     from the multiple clerical collaborators to classroom <span class="foreign i">auctor</span> is dramatized in the Harley illustration, which includes an
                     accretive figure that is a swallow, a preacher, and finally Aesop himself. 
                  </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p24">24</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p24"> The third remixed element of the Harley illustration, the disembodied head, is
                     perhaps the most peculiar contributor to this increasing tension between multiple
                     and
                     singular models of authorship. Given the fact that the head is bereft of any
                     discernible body and lacking the color of other figures in the illustration, it is
                     easy to overlook. It is quite possible, in fact, that the illustrator remained
                     undecided about what to do with this head, leaving it unfinished. After all, the only
                     reasonable explanation for its existence is its juxtaposition with what appears to
                     be
                     the “hedge”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#fox1981">Fox 1981</a>, 1729] that the narrator hides behind in order to eavesdrop on this parliament of
                     fowls. The insertion of a witness into a fable is a departure from the conventions
                     of
                     the genre and a complication of point of view that Henryson champions throughout his
                     collection. Despite his deferral to Aesop's authority throughout his fables, Henryson
                     consistently asserts himself as an interpretive interloper in one way or another.
                     The
                     Harley illustrator seemed to sense the authorial conflict represented by a narrative
                     figure who could threaten the credibility and coherence of Aesop, the
                     well-established author of the fable. As a possible compromise, the illustrator
                     returns to the frontispiece, but this time to a low point in Aesop’s life, his
                     violent demise – or what we might view as an allegorical or Barthean moment of
                     authorial death. This image of a man falling down a hill is actually an illustration
                     of Aesop being tossed over a cliff, an episode from the <cite class="title italic">Vita
                        Aesopi</cite> absent from Henryson’s fables and the Bassandyne print (<a href="#figure07">fig. 7</a>).

                     </div> The correspondence between the two images in their entirety, a floating
                     head and a prostrate body, are not convincing replicas of each other, but if we
                     examine the position of Aesop’s body in relationship to his statue, we can see that
                     his head is placed in a similar position as the disembodied head, both situated below
                     the pulpit-pedestal. If we are expected to associate these two images, a crisis of
                     textual authority arises because the head behind the hedge would presumably be the
                     narrator or Henryson, himself. Furthermore, his disembodiment, and arguably his
                     botched erasure from the scene, reflects an attempt by the illustrator to privilege
                     the figure of the preacher Aesop, a figure who would increasingly become the
                     exclusive author of all beast fables.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p25"> During the latter part of the fifteenth century when Henryson was composing his
                     fables, the Aesopic corpus experienced a transformation that coincided with the
                     arrival of the printing press. This newly mechanized system of textual production
                     witnessed a division and dismemberment of fable collections into discrete textual
                     traditions, now available in a variety of vernaculars, including English, French,
                     German, and Italian. Printers were then faced with the daunting prospect of
                     distilling a highly dynamic and encyclopedic genre, which contained multiple sets
                     and
                     variations of fables and their commentaries, into a reproducible form that could be
                     easily absorbed by a new reading public. Despite Aesop’s new public façade, readers
                     were increasingly faced with what Benjamin called “graduated and hierarchized mediation,” still a far
                     cry from his description of the state of the press in the late-nineteenth century,
                     in
                     which “an increasing number of readers became
                     writers”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#benjamin1968">Benjamin 1968</a>, 235, 232]. Rather, I would suggest, this unstable moment of transition in the fifteenth
                     century between script and print led to increasing efforts to contain the authorial
                     aura of Aesop, which can be witnessed in the changing nature of descriptions and
                     illustrations of his physical body. And even more fascinatingly, this corporeal
                     transformation is accompanied by attempts to consolidate the widely varied and
                     dynamic fable corpora into a singular and reproducible Aesopic corpus.

                     manuscripts, but absent in the Bassandyne Henryson, was the biographical <cite class="title italic">Vita Aesopi</cite>, the standard preface to the curricular fables,
                     which provides a surprisingly monstrous illustration of Aesop's physical body, as
                     recounted by Caxton (see above, paragraph 8). It is no accident, of course, that
                     Caxton’s striking description matches the figure of Aesop in Steinhöwel’s
                     frontispiece to the fables, crafted only eight years earlier. Perhaps more than any
                     other depiction of Aesop, this humpbacked barefoot giant could be described as
                     grotesque, incompatible with the traditional image of the classical author
                     represented in Romanesque sculpture. Furthermore, his status as a venerated medieval
                     classroom authority is belied by what is described in the text as his initial
                     stuttering of a language comprehensible only to himself, an impediment that
                     highlights the corporeality of poetic production and threatens the very possibility
                     of an Aesopic literary corpus.

                     Aesop became increasingly difficult to detect. For example, if we turn to the 1571
                     frontispiece of the Bassandyne print of Robert Henryson’s fables, we find a more
                     normalized authorial figure (see <a href="resources/images/figure05.png" onclick="window.open('resources/images/figure05.png'); return false" class="ref">fig.
                        5</a>). This more shapely Aesop is still, however, an odd match for Henryson’s
                     own physical description of the fabulist that appears in his “The
                     Lion and the Mouse” fable. The narrator even goes so far as to present

                     illustration of “The Preaching of the Swallow,” Henryson’s
                     introduction of a curly-haired fabulist is a symptom of a growing conflict between
                     competing notions of textual authority in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. On
                     the one hand, textual and visual fabular corpora had largely been open sources, ripe
                     for conversion for new uses and audiences. On the other, the encyclopedic
                     accumulation and expansion of fable collections required printers to develop
                     editorial apparatus to create an appearance of textual control. In Henryson, this
                     tension is palpable, simultaneously acknowledging appropriation as a core value of
                     fabular production while offering a singular model of authorship through a beautified
                     Aesop. Moreover, it is hardly a coincidence that the physical body of Aesop
                     experiences a dramatic makeover at the same time that the Aesopic corpus becomes
                     increasingly codified and closed.

                     technologies, it would be enormously reductive and technologically deterministic to
                     conclude that the printing press ushered in this move towards singular authorship
                     and
                     literary property. After all, the Aesopic corpus experienced a number of educational
                     and political transformations throughout the late-sixteenth and seventeenth
                     centuries, as can be witnessed in the printed editions of John Brinsely (1617 and
                     1624), John Ogilby (1651 and 1668), Sir Roger L’Estrange (1692), and Jean de la
                     Fontaine (1668-94) [<a class="ref" href="#patterson1991">Patterson 1991</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#blake2017">Blake and Santos 2017</a>, 13–28]. Within late-seventeenth-century pedagogical
                     discourse, however, we begin to see less of an emphasis on fable interpretation and
                     more of a focus on the fable itself, particularly as it would relate to childhood
                     development [<a class="ref" href="#lerer2008">Lerer 2008</a>, 104–28]. And throughout the subsequent
                     centuries, Aesopica would play a central role within the development of the speaking
                     animal tale of children’s literature, a progenitor for Lewis Carroll’s <cite class="title italic">Alice in Wonderland</cite> (1865) and Kenneth Grahame’s <cite class="title italic">The Wind in the Willows</cite> (1908). By the mid-twentieth
                     century, the effacement of the fabular interpretative tradition had become so acute
                     that the classicist Lloyd W. Daly could publish a collection entitled <cite class="title italic">Aesop Without Morals</cite>, an English translation of the fables
                     with their morals relegated to an appendix, much in the manner of answers in the back
                     of a schoolbook [<a class="ref" href="#daly1961">Daly 1961</a>, 267–307]. Condemning the simple
                     one-line morals as an “encumbrance” and “little more than an insult to our
                     intelligence”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#daly1961">Daly 1961</a>, 12], Daly offers the fables in isolation as “mirror[s] of self-reflection”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#daly1961">Daly 1961</a>, 11]. While he acknowledges the variability of the Aesopic tradition, he refers to
                     the fables as both a “literary product”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#daly1961">Daly 1961</a>, 12] and a “floating, common property”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#daly1961">Daly 1961</a>, 15], suggesting that the fables are designed to promote individual intellectual
                     development. By unmooring the fables from their morals, Daly’s fables
                     “float” as unified objects of reflection, affording them a
                     romantic completeness that suggests that their artistic evolution had come to an end.
                     Aesop’s fables could now become common products designed for select, private, and
                     individual consumption.

                     idiosyncratic, even more recent editions, such as Olivia and Robert Temple’s <cite class="title italic">Aesop: The Complete Fables</cite> (1998), reflect this modern
                     tendency to reduce Aesop to a containable property. As a Penguin paperback designed
                     for the mass market, the translators bypass the unruly medieval Latin tradition
                     entirely and rely exclusively on Émile Chambry’s 1927 edition of the Greek prose
                     fables. They justify their choice in a “Note on the Text”
                     this way: “We have taken Chambry’s text to represent
                     the ‘complete’ fables for the purposes of this volume,
                     although every scholar would probably alter the text by taking away some and
                     adding others according to his or her own personal choices . . . the
                     ‘complete fables of Aesop’ is whatever the editor of its
                     Greek text chooses to say it is”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#aesop1998">Aesop 1998</a>, xxiv]. By claiming that the “completeness” of the corpus – the
                     qualifying scare-quotes of which are eliminated in the title and back cover
                     description of the edition – is determined by the editor, Aesop becomes a commodified
                     property with boundary lines that are defined by “personal
                     choices” and particular “purposes,” euphemisms for
                     market demands that ride on hyperbolic claims such as “the first translation <span class="hi italic">ever</span> to make available the complete corpus”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#aesop1998">Aesop 1998</a>, back cover]. This contention relies upon both the denigration of Aesopic authors such as
                     Babrius and Phaedrus, whom Robert Temple calls “second- or third-rate adapters”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#aesop1998">Aesop 1998</a>, xviii], and the devaluation of the dynamic commentary tradition, represented by some “appalling, even idiotic”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#aesop1998">Aesop 1998</a>, xv] morals that the Temples separate from the fables. Such an attempt to purify
                     the Aesopic corpus from its grotesque literary history and messy commentary tradition
                     effectively makes Aesop a property defined by mass-market aims and idiosyncratic
                     editorial limitations.

                     and perform texts [<a class="ref" href="#boyle2012">Boyle and Foys 2012</a>, 2]. And to some extent, even the
                     early association of books with libraries perpetuated this shift. As Michael Camille
                     suggests, “The whole history, development, and, to
                     some extent, the institutional aims of the modern library have been to exclude

                     <span class="foreign i">biblioteca</span> the simulacrum of purely mental
                     experience, a process that will only accelerate in the future with the

                      [<a class="ref" href="#camille1997">Camille 1997</a>, 40]. Within the recent emergence of digital libraries, texts have migrated even
                     further from the body to become consolidated into the <span class="foreign i">loci</span> of databases, hidden behind the most indulgent proprietary fantasy
                     of all: the “paywall.” To protect the online value of these
                     intellectual properties, publishers have erected password-protected screens that
                     require readers to pay a premium for full access to content. Blaming the decline of
                     print subscription and advertisement, scholarly journals and the news media justify
                     the blocking of free access as their only means of revenue generation. The paywall
                     is
                     also a proprietary metaphor that reveals the foundation of many institutions that
                     produce knowledge, from the university to the newsroom: an artificial barrier that
                     creates scarcity, enhances value, and accumulates capital. Moreover, the forms of
                     access the paywall regulates are unevenly distributed across universities, and even
                     across fields in ways that map onto the unequal structures of funding that have come
                     to define the modern university. In this sense, the paywall not only offers a means
                     toward understanding how the contemporary university has become an engine of
                     inequality, but also contributes to it directly.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e1414">[7]</a> Given the high institutional

                     body as a an intellectual property whose doors are closed to many users. It is
                     locked, fixed, monetized, and controlled by a singular entity, a move presaged by
                     Aesopic printers and modern editors, who increasingly consolidated Aesop’s expandable
                     corpus into one classical figure.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p32"> Many have now joined the “open access revolution,” which seeks to
                     resist the increasing author-facing charges and subscription fees imposed by academic
                     publishers. Yet, even for digital initiatives such as the Text Creation Partnership
                     (TCP), which creates freely available XML/SGML encoded editions of a number of early
                     printed books, including those on EEBO, the access to the books is limited to their
                     textual transcriptions. And while the EEBO-TCP is enormously valuable for
                     cross-corpus searching, lexicographical study, and textual analysis, these printed
                     codices are effectively reduced to data, alphabetic texts that have shed their
                     codicological features. These “books” are now encoded text files
                     of digital scans available on EEBO, which are, themselves, de-somaticized images of
                     individual pages from early printed books. As Rebecca Welzenbach notes, for users
                     “who want to quickly get at the
                     content of the texts, not work with the data itself, XML files are not useful
                     unless they are indexed by a search engine and presented in a web
                     interface”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#welzenbach2011">Welzenbach 2011</a>, 5]. By reducing them to data, the physical features of the books that are
                     represented visually on EEBO – namely, the marginalia, the illustrations, the textual
                     layouts, the fonts, and even handwritten corrections – are eliminated, effectively
                     stripped of the corporeal traces of author, printer, or reader. The texts are now
                     available to be transmitted to new locations and uploaded to new interfaces: EEBO-TCP
                     users are even encouraged “not to worry about where they
                     discover the data, but where it comes from”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#welzenbach2011">Welzenbach 2011</a>, 12]. While the TCP clearly provides a valuable resource for many digital humanists
                     and early book scholars, it also perpetuates the increasingly proprietary character
                     of the digital book, which has become defined more by “where” we find it, than
                     “who” created it or “what” it is. For example, Henryson is not even
                     listed as the author of the <cite class="title italic">Morall Fabillis</cite> on
                     EEBO-TCP’s “Author” browse feature. Instead the credit is given to Aesop, yet
                     another example of the consolidation of this corpus into one authorial figure [<a class="ref" href="#EEBO-TCP2003">EEBO-TCP 2003</a>]. More importantly, these text files are in danger of
                     becoming metonyms for the books themselves, just one member of the corpus standing
                     in
                     for all.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p33"> From the perspective of Aesopic poets and early humanists like Henryson, this
                     privileging of one member of a corpus (i.e. one author, one text) at the expense of
                     the others (i.e. illustrators, commentators, etc.) would have seemed inimical to the
                     common good, especially to many in the fifteenth century who had been thoroughly
                     schooled in Ciceronian notions of the body politic. In his <cite class="title italic">De
                        Officiis</cite>, Cicero uses a corporeal metaphor to describe the danger of
                     self-interested proprietary claims: “Suppose, by way of comparison, that each
                     one of our bodily members should conceive this idea and imagine that it could
                     be strong and well if it should draw off to itself the health and strength of
                     its neighboring member, the whole body would necessarily be enfeebled and die;
                     so if each one of us should seize upon the property of his neighbors and take
                     from each whatever he could appropriate to his own use, the bonds of human
                     society must inevitably be annihilated”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#cicero1947">Cicero 1947</a>, 3.5.22].<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e1478">[8]</a> For Cicero, if the act of appropriation itself can be
                     appropriated and limited to one member, the communal body cannot thrive. His
                     insistence on the body as a symbol of a republic is, in turn, replicated in the fable
                     “The Belly and the Members” that became a central
                     feature in many Aesopic collections, including the <cite class="title italic">elegiac
                        Romulus</cite> and Caxton’s <cite class="title italic">Aesop</cite>, as well as a
                     contentious political metaphor in England for the relationship between a monarch and
                     her subjects throughout the seventeenth century [<a class="ref" href="#patterson1991">Patterson 1991</a>, 111–37]. Henry Turner calls this hierarchical conflict “the problem of the ‘more-than-one,’” or the
                     tension between the part and the whole, as well as “the laws and power necessary to regulate
                     relationships among people and the values that justify this regulation”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#turner2006">Turner 2006</a>, 416–417]. Just as this conflict arises for artists caught between the protections of
                     copyright law and the free culture of the creative commons, this struggle is palpable
                     for Henryson and his contemporaries, who were caught in the cradle of their
                     incunabular moment, vying with printers for their share of the marketplace. According
                     to Turner, this contention gave rise to the sixteenth century
                     “corporation,” which attempted to actualize the corporeal
                     identity of political and knowledge communities: “At once an ‘artificial person’ and
                     a fictive community, the corporation is both ‘one’ and ‘many,’
                     enjoying rights and freedoms that are simultaneously rights of persons and
                     rights of collectivities”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#turner2006">Turner 2006</a>, 427n46]. As both a singular figure and a textual community of authors and
                     commentators, the medieval Aesop serves as a prototype of the early modern
                     corporation and a representative an intellectual gift economy, in which scholarly
                     or
                     artistic work is transparently shared and used. But just as medieval practices of
                     appropriation have become exploited for privatized and monetized within digital
                     databases, the corporation has become too often an entity that immunizes stakeholders
                     against risks at the exclusion of others.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p34"> Even if we were to agree to reclaim the corporeal nature of intellectual work, how
                     might we move beyond the proprietary language that grips our conception of a
                     “creative commons”? On the one hand, if we perceive of a creative commons as
                     shared property, appropriation cannot exist. We cannot appropriate what is already
                     “proper” to us. If, on the other hand, we agree with Roberto
                     Esposito that our understanding of the commons is “the totality of persons united not by a ‘property’ but
                     precisely by an obligation or a debt,” then any assertion of subjectivity
                     or interpretation cannot exist either [<a class="ref" href="#esposito2010">Esposito 2010</a>, 6]. Any
                     contribution to the community is defined by a duty to be performed, not the
                     participation of a desiring subject. The opposite of community, for Esposito, is
                     immunity, which negates any participation or indebted fulfillment of office [<a class="ref" href="#esposito2010">Esposito 2010</a>, 6]. This cynical impulse drives restrictive claims
                     to intellectual “ownership” championed by copyright attorneys and
                     publishing corporations like ProQuest. Immunity opens the space for subjectivity,
                     but
                     it is exclusively hostile to any notion of a creative community.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p35"> And while some communities, especially those that oppress others, should be subject
                     to critique and sanction, creative communities cannot survive on cycles of
                     destruction and immunization. If we want such artistic communities to thrive, we must
                     reject, following Esposito, any understanding of community based in common property,
                     since such a proprietary conception of knowledge production only leads to restrictive
                     claims to intellectual property and copyright, which are often at odds with creative
                     and interpretive practices, particularly within the contexts of Aesopic textuality
                     and digital remix. We might go so far as to challenge the very use of the term
                     “appropriation,” or taking for one’s own what is proper to another, since
                     this fundamentally suggests the use of someone else’s property. Yet, as postcolonial
                     analyses have shown, even cultural appropriation may not be simply reduced to
                     “theft” and often becomes, as Kathleen M. Ashley and Véronique Plesch
                     suggest, a “two-way process, one in which exchange
                     and creative response may take place”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#ashley2002">Ashley and Plesch 2002</a>, 6]. Such dialogic artistic practices may indeed operate as acts of “ambivalent <span class="foreign i">homage</span>,” obscuring the language of property within the act of
                     appropriation.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p36"> Aesop’s fables and EEBO’s incunables are now available in more libraries and
                     databases than ever before, but the cost of their massive distribution has been the
                     gradual diminution of their corporeal character. Whereas Aesopica had been produced
                     by multiple fabulists and commentators and early printed books had been mashed up
                     by
                     their readers and illustrators, these corpuses have increasingly become a “floating, common property” and a
                     textual landscape to be “mined.” Within the <span class="foreign i">longue durée</span> of remixing and the increased assertion of intellectual
                     property rights, it is difficult to imagine a neo-Aesopic corporation through which
                     appropriation and interpretation are no longer immunized, or without office. There
                     may be, however, a <em class="emph">munificent</em> way to conceive of creative communities
                     that synthesizes Esposito’s biopolitics with Turner’s theorization of the early
                     modern “group person”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#turner2016">Turner 2016</a>]. As Esposito notes, the Latin root <span class="foreign i">munus</span> of
                     community can mean both an obligation and a gift. And while he goes to great lengths
                     to reject the “voluntary” connotation of <span class="foreign i">munus</span>
                     by demonstrating the gift’s requirement of gratitude [<a class="ref" href="#esposito2010">Esposito 2010</a>, 4–5], we only need to turn to the Aesopic invitation to “take both” to find a communal body based
                     in generosity, goodwill, and the production of new fabulists, such as Avianus, Marie
                     de France, and Robert Henryson. This addition of <span class="foreign i">auctores</span> to Aesopica is a model of what we might call an articulated
                     corporation, a singular artistic corpus that invites and accumulates new members.
                     Within such a grotesque vision of artistic production, intellectual work is no longer
                     a property to be owned, but a multi-membered body to be fed, nurtured, and
                     continually reshaped and redressed for new occasions and new creators.
