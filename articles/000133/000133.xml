                        <p> Professor Short has an educational background in the Humanities,
                            Mathematics, Computing and Systems, and in consequence, has research
                            interests in the many aspects of digital scholarship. Professor Short's
                            work aims to improve understanding of the intersection of the arts and
                            humanities with computing. In particular he is interested in any
                            challenges and opportunities this offers, including the dynamics of
                            research publication and the formal data structure required for database
                            and text encoding technologies. His research also focuses on changes in
                            methodologies — as well as the development of new methods. Additionally,
                            he has a keen interest in the ways in which digital humanities may be

            <dhq:abstract>
                <p> Harold Short recounts that his interest in Computing and the Humanities goes
                    back to when he was an undergraduate in English and French at a university in
                    the former Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). There, whilst undertaking summer work in the
                    library, he saw first-hand the potential of digital methods. After arriving in
                    London in 1972 he took an Open University degree in mathematics, computing and
                    systems. Among his early influences he identifies the reading he did on matters
                    related to cognitive science whilst undertaking a postgraduate certificated in
                    education. In the UK he worked at the BBC as programmer, systems analyst and
                    then systems manager. In 1988 he moved to King's College London to take up the
                    post of Assistant Director in Computing Services for Humanities and Information
                    Management. One of his first tasks was to work with the Humanities Faculty to
                    develop an undergraduate programme in humanities and computing. The first
                    digital humanities conference he attended was the first joint international
                    conference of ALLC and ACH, held at the University Toronto in 1989, which c. 450
                    people attended. He reflects on aspects of the institutional shape of the field
                    towards the end of the 1980s, including the key Centres that existed then, the
                    first meeting of the Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing (ALLC)
                    and those who were active in it such as Roy Wisbey, Susan Hockey and the late
                    Antonio Zampolli. He gives a detailed discussion of the development of what is
                    now the Department of Digital Humanities in King's College London, both in terms
                    of the administrative and institutional issues involved, as well as the
                    intellectual. He also reflects on some of the most successful collaborations
                    that the Department has been involved in, for example, the AHRC funded Henry III
                    Fine Rolls project, and the conditions and working practices that characterised
                    them. He closes by discussing his impressions about the movement of scholars
                    into and out of the discipline and of the institutional issues that have
                    had an impact on digital humanities centres. </p>

            <div>
                <head>Preamble</head>
                <p> Harold Short has an educational background in the Humanities, Mathematics,
                    Computing and Systems, and in consequence, has research interests in the many
                    aspects of digital scholarship. His work aims to improve
                    understanding of the intersection of the arts and humanities with computing. In
                    particular he is interested in any challenges and opportunities this offers,
                    including the dynamics of research publication and the formal data structure
                    required for database and text encoding technologies. His research also focuses
                    on changes in methodologies — as well as the development of new methods.
                    Additionally, he has a keen interest in the ways in which digital humanities may
                    be organised at institutional levels both locally and internationally. More
                    information is available at <ref target="http://rg.kcl.ac.uk/staffprofiles/staffprofile.php?pid=804"
                      >http://www.mccarty.org.uk/</ref>. He is Professor of Humanities Computing at King’s College London and a Visiting Professor at the University of Western Sydney in the School of Computing, Engineering and Mathematics.</p>
                <p>Throughout this interview Short reflects, both implicitly and explicitly, on the
                    nature of collaboration and the kinds of institutional and disciplinary
                    partnerships and leadership that are needed for digital humanities research to
                    flourish. He alludes to the importance of digital humanities scholars carrying
                    out excellent scholarship and engaging in partnerships with equally excellent,
                    and indeed, intellectually curious humanities scholars. This is, of course,
                    widely recognised. Equally important, though much less explored and discussed is
                    the importance of the <q>behind the scenes</q> work, such as the administrative, strategic and research-management work that he discusses at length in this interview. This multifaceted work was carried out at an
                    institutional level, in discussions with, inter alia, Deans and Provosts about
                    mergers, budgets and institutional identity, as evidenced by his discussion of
                    the various stages that the now Department of Digital Humanities, Kings College
                    London, went through, from a support unit to a fully-fledged academic
                    department. It involved generous, painstaking and time consuming work with brilliant scholars, some of whom who did not initially understand computing and its potential, as evidenced by his discussion of the Henry III Fine Rolls project. So too it required the
                    determination to clearly articulate the nature of digital humanities research,
                    as he stated <q>if you know me you'll know that has been an important part of my
                        thinking all along, the crucial thing from the very outset is that we were
                        not a service, we didn't have a service role in our projects, we only took
                        on projects if it was as equal partners. ... [M]y understanding — it remains
                        now, is that in real research in the digital humanities research projects,
                        ... digital research [is] going on alongside the humanities research and the
                        two have to be put together, and so, [if] someone wanted a database built,
                        we'll say <q>well, the Computing Services Department can do that for you</q>
                        ... collaboration has got to be fundamental or it's not gonna work.
                        Everybody has got to understand that the other person has something to
                        contribute.</q> This administrative, strategic and research management
                    strand of the history of digital humanities offers many interesting research
                    questions that remain largely uninvestigated.</p>

                    <speaker>Julianne Nyhan</speaker>
                    <p> So, Harold, can you please tell me about how it was that you first got
                        involved with the idea of using the computer in the humanities? </p>
                </sp>

                    <speaker>Harold Short</speaker>
                    <p> That actually goes back to my undergraduate career, which was in French and
                        English. This was at university in Central Africa, in the country that is
                        now Zimbabwe. I was interested in computing and I actually did vacation work
                        in the library and started to see some of the potential for digital methods
                        in information management and retrieval. So, when I came to leave Zimbabwe
                        in 1971, [or] Rhodesia as it was [known then], and took the move to the
                        United Kingdom [arriving in 1972], I already knew that I wanted to change
                        career and do something in information technology. And so I had a series of
                        jobs in information technology and at the same time did an Open University
                        degree in Mathematics, Computing and Systems. I worked for International
                        Computers and then for the British Broadcasting Corporation. I used to have
                        fun telling people who asked me that I wrote programmes for the BBC, and if
                        I was lucky they would say, <q>oh, which ones?</q> and I would say, <q>well,
                            they're ones with very low viewing figures.</q> And then I saw — I'd
                        been with the BBC eleven years, I wasn't particularly desperate to leave —
                        but I saw a job advertised at King's College London that combined computing
                        and humanities. So, I applied and at the time, it seems a bit quaint now,
                        but King's required not only two professional referees but a personal
                        referee. As my personal referee I named someone I had been in university
                        with in Rhodesia, he and his wife had travelled over with me and my ex-wife
                        on a boat from Cape Town to Lisbon, and he phoned me in great excitement
                        when he received the documents about the job and he said: <q>This is the job
                            you described to us on the boat coming over!</q> So, it had been a long
                        standing idea that I've had and I'd kind of been looking for a chance to
                        bring my computing experience back into the humanities. That's the origin of
                        my interest in the two being together. </p>

                    <speaker>Nyhan</speaker>
                    <p> And this idea that you'd already started to sketch out on the boat coming
                        over, this sort of intersection, what do you think influenced you and what
                        were your models in this? </p>
                </sp>
                <sp>
                    <speaker>Short</speaker>
                    <p> I suppose there had been partly just general reading and things that were in
                        the news and so on. But I think, probably also the work in the library
                        because some of the librarians there were starting to think about
                        digitisation, what it would mean, and although their focus obviously was
                        particularly on record management, nevertheless, it was in the air in a
                        sense. But then, I think probably the more fundamental thing was the year I
                        spent doing a postgraduate certificate in education, because a lot of the
                        literature that we were reading there involved...it was in one sense early
                        days for the kind of cognitive science that is now very common, and so,
                        looking at thinking about how the brain works in relation to how computers
                        might work, and so on, was all part of the zeitgeist. And so, if I had to
                        pick one particular influence, it would be some of the reading I did as part
                        of that education programme. </p>

                    <speaker>Nyhan</speaker>
                    <p> When you made this move from the BBC to King's, can you remember the things
                        that especially struck you about the differences between the two
                        environments that you were working in, for example, the perception of the
                        computer — was there a noticeable difference between those two sectors? </p>
                </sp>
                <sp>
                    <speaker>Short</speaker>
                    <p> In one sense that's a difficult question to answer because in the BBC I was
                        first a programmer, then a systems analyst, then a systems manager, and so
                        the context was one in which there were very specific organisational issues
                        and in particular, I worked for BBC engineering, which for historical
                        reasons was where the capital budget of the BBC resided, and so I was mainly
                        working with financial systems. The one exception was a big project I was
                        involved in for the BBC transmitters. [It involved] talking and looking at
                        integrating data from all the different transmitting stations as part of
                        their process of starting to automate more and more of the transmitting
                        stations — they had previously all been manned, but more and more they were
                        becoming automated. So, there were very specific organisational or technical
                        issues being addressed in my work in the BBC, but at the same time, any
                        large administrative system has a lot of human components, and so as a
                        systems analyst if you're going to do a good job, you have to take account
                        of people's behaviour, expectations, training — all sorts of issues. </p>
                    <p> There's one other thing I'll come back to in a second, but let me say first
                        of all, when I got to King's, of course, there had been a long tradition of
                        the use of computers in the humanities, this was at King's going back to the
                        late sixties, early seventies. A man called Roy Wisbey, who was one of the
                        pioneers of European humanities computing, he'd been at Cambridge before he
                        came to King's as Professor of German, and at Cambridge he had started
                        something called the Centre for Literary and Linguistic Computing, which, I
                        think it may just about no longer exist now, but it had a long history. And
                        so it was mainly to do with concordances and that kind of thing, typical of
                        the early days of humanities computing, but nevertheless, it meant that
                        there was already this long tradition by the time I got to King's in '88,
                        there was already nearly twenty years' tradition of using computers in
                        humanities research. In fact, one of the reasons for the job that I applied
                        for was that Roy Wisbey happened to be a Vice Principal in 1986, when they
                        were discussing a merger of Chelsea College of Art, Queen Elizabeth College
                        and King's. Queen Elizabeth College actually had started as King's College
                        for Women, it was the women's part of King's College and then it had become
                        independent in the way that a lot of University of London colleges did. And
                        then in the late eighties and nineties it was all the opposite direction,
                        they were all merging. Anyway, as part of this merger, Roy Wisbey as a Vice
                        Principal ensured that one of the reconstituted computing services groups
                        had a role [in] supporting humanities, so the job I applied for was an
                        Assistant Director in the Computing Services for Humanities and Information
                        Management. </p>
                    <p> So, it was a very different environment, because the idea was to try and
                        develop one specific task. One of my first specific tasks was to work with
                        the Humanities Faculty to develop an undergraduate programme in humanities
                        and computing. They were looking to us to do that because when they had
                        approached the Computer Science Department, I have to say at that stage,
                        King's has a very good Computer Science Department these days, but at that
                        stage it was so bad that it was in danger of being disaccredited by the
                        British Computer Society. So, it was that bad. But they were responsive in-,
                            <q>we have programming courses, so just send your students on our
                            existing courses,</q> so no concept of any kind of issues that arise
                        when you bring humanities and technology together. So that was one
                        challenge, and then the other was picking up the pieces, picking up the
                        pieces is the wrong phrase, because that implies there was a problem,
                        building on the work that had already been going on, in terms of looking at
                        new ways to use computers, beyond the more traditional, by that stage
                        traditional activities of concordancing and that kind of thing. In a sense,
                        it was almost a blank sheet but with a basis to build on, and that was
                        really interesting and a great challenge to be faced with. A huge part of
                        what I was facing when I arrived at King's was looking at ways to approach
                        and interact with humanities scholars and fortunately, King's is one of the
                        places in the UK, where humanities has always been of particular excellence,
                        it has always been, along with UCL and Oxford and Cambridge, one of the top
                        four or five humanities institutions in Research Assessment Exercises and
                        that kind of thing. And so it meant that you were actually working with
                        excellent scholars. This is probably getting ahead of the conversation a
                        little bit but when I'm asked about why the department was so successful in
                        generating research income, one of the key factors, I always say, is working
                        with excellent scholars, because if one of the world's leading medieval
                        historians has their name at the top of your proposal, and it involves
                        digital methods, they don't ask the same sort of questions as if it's a
                        historian they've never heard of who is proposing to use some new-fangled
                        methods that they don't know about. I would say that's the key difference,
                        from moving from very constrained and highly specified type of tasks, task
                        group, to a much more open, as you would expect in a university environment.
                        What was the aside that I was going to mention? </p>
                </sp>
                <sp>
                    <speaker>Nyhan</speaker>
                    <p> Yeah, something you were going to come back to. You were talking about Roy
                        and you said you would just come back to it. </p>
                </sp>
                <sp>
                    <speaker>Short</speaker>
                    <p>It's gone, ... </p>
                </sp>
                <sp>
                    <speaker>Nyhan</speaker>
                    <p> Yeah, you'll probably think of it when you don't think about it for a
                        moment. </p>
                </sp>
                <sp>
                    <speaker>Short</speaker>
                    <p> Yeah. </p>
                </sp>
                <sp>
                    <speaker>Nyhan</speaker>
                    <p> When you think back, you said it was '88 you joined, so how did the field in
                        general look, or the idea of a field, in 1988? </p>
                </sp>
                <sp>
                    <speaker>Short</speaker>
                    <p> As it turned out it was a wonderful moment to start a career in Digital
                        Humanities, because '89 was the first joint international conference of ALLC
                        and ACH, and it was the University Toronto and there were 450 people there,
                        there was a week of workshops before and a week of workshops afterwards. So
                        I was very lucky in that two of the key members of the team that I inherited
                        were already very engaged and already knew quite a lot about what was going
                        on. One was an archaeologist and one, her partner, was a remarkable fellow,
                        who was, well she was remarkable, but her partner was equally remarkable. He
                        had a first degree in physics and a masters in computer science and was just
                        in the process of doing a part-time degree at Birkbeck in Classics, when I
                        first met him. So the two of them were already reading the journals and they
                        were able to point me in some really good directions and they're the ones
                        who said more or less within a week of my arriving: <q>If there's one thing
                            you do this year, you must go to this conference in Toronto, because
                            you'll find out what's going on in the field.</q> So, the week before
                        the conference they have these workshops and then this rich conference,
                        absolutely amazing, and of course as an introduction to the field it was
                        wonderful. That doesn't really answer your question about what the field
                        looked like. </p>
                </sp>
                <sp>
                    <speaker>Nyhan</speaker>
                    <p> That's an indication, because I had just wondered, was King's this-, as we
                        try to think back and imagine what we don't know, I had just wondered, was
                        King's this bastion in Europe, or how did it intersect? </p>
                </sp>
                <sp>
                    <speaker>Short</speaker>
                    <p> No. I don't think anyone would have described it as that. It was one of the
                        places. In the UK, there was Oxford, Cambridge, and King's, were the three
                        places where there were humanities computing activities going [on]. At the
                        stage I would have thought Oxford would have been thought of as the leading
                        institution, Susan Hockey was there, and she was very involved in the
                        Associations and so on. But there were also a number of European
                        institutions, including some in France and Germany that then kind of
                        disappeared from the scene within a few years. The meeting of ALLC happened
                        to have been at King's because Roy Wisbey was there, it could equally have
                        been at Oxford. I think it was at King's because it's easier for people to
                        get to, but it was very European from the outset. Roy was elected the first
                        chair. I think Susan might have been the first secretary, although I'm not
                        absolutely certain but of course she later became chair and was chair for 13
                        years. And then Antonio Zampolli, the late Antonio Zampolli, was elected
                        president. But I think the fact that the founding meeting was at King's was
                        just an indication that King's was one of the places, not because it was
                        seen as the leading institution by any means. </p>

                    <speaker>Nyhan</speaker>

                    <speaker>Short</speaker>
                    <p> That's the Toronto conference and Toronto was certainly one of the places
                        that people thought of being, as Willard McCarty was there then. And he was
                        just establishing his presence if you like, <title rend="italic"
                            >Humanist</title> was a few years old and the Centre for Computing
                        Humanities at Toronto was seen as probably the leading institution in the
                        world at that time. </p>

                    <p> Could you talk a little bit about that transition from a support role to a
                        department? </p>
                </sp>
                <sp>
                    <speaker>Short</speaker>
                    <p> Yeah, sure. There are a number of factors involved, maybe let me tell you
                        the sequence first of all and then we can talk about factors if you like. So
                        '88 was when we started, by '92 it was clear that there were some
                        substantial research projects ready to move forward, and actually starting,
                        and so we got agreement from the — I'll call it the School of Humanities, it
                        had a slightly different name at that time, but that's what it was. It
                        agreed to fund one post and the computing centre agreed to one of my team's
                        posts being dedicated to something we called the Research Unit in Humanities
                        Computing. The crucial significance of that from my perspective was that
                        both the school and the computing centre agreed to dedicate a post. And for
                        the School of Humanities that was new money, a new post. That was
                        sufficiently successful that by '95, so this was '92, by '95, it was clear
                        that we needed additional focus, and additional resources and capacity for
                        developing research projects with the School of Humanities, with the
                        scholars in the school of humanities. So, the expansion is what led to the
                        change of name from Research Unit in Humanities Computing to Centre for
                        Computing in the Humanities. Then from '95 on that was how we were. In 2001,
                        a new director-, oh sorry, one thing to mention in that period between '95
                        and 2000, one of the things that I got very involved in, as Assistant
                        Director of computing services was the merger of computing services with the
                        library into something called Information Services, and just as a footnote,
                        King's College has recently announced that they're going to divide them
                        again. Anyway, that's neither here nor there. </p>
                    <p> So then there was a new Director of Information Services in the early 2000s,
                        who decided that the Centre for Computing in the Humanities was not a good
                        fit, because of all the academic stuff we were doing, we were teaching
                        undergraduate programmes, we had just announced the development of a
                        master's programme, we were involved in large numbers of, by this stage,
                        large numbers of research projects, and it was clear from the beginning and
                        this, if you know me you'll know that has been an important part of my
                        thinking all along, the crucial thing from the very outset is that we were
                        not a service, we didn't have a service role in our projects, we only took
                        on projects if it was as equal partners. On the principle, my understanding
                        — it remains now, is that in real research in the digital humanities
                        research projects, there is digital research that's going on alongside the
                        humanities research and the two have to be put together, and so, someone
                        wanted a database built, we'll say <q>well, the Computing Services
                            Department can do that for you</q> . If they want to talk to us about
                        how to address research questions, then that's where we started. So, I can
                        sympathise in a sense with the attitude of the Director of Information
                        Services, he actually didn't last very long in the role, only a couple of
                        years, but he thought ISD, Information Services, needed to refocus as a
                        service delivery department, and so he saw no role for the Centre of
                        Computing in the Humanities. So that was the stage at which someone who had
                        previously been Head of the School of Humanities and very supportive of the
                        development of, first of all, the Research Unit in Humanities Computing and
                        then the Centre for Computing in the Humanities, a man called Barry Ive, by
                        this stage he was a vice principle, and so he and I had a number of
                        conversations. In fact, I'd heard the news about the IS Director's viewpoint
                        just as I was leaving for a conference in Australia in 2001, and I was
                        somewhat anxious about what the future might hold, but Barry sent me an
                        email saying <q>don't worry</q> . We started some substantial discussions
                        and I basically said, <q>I think this gives us an opportunity.</q> He said,
                            <q>you know, looking at CCH, you walk like a duck and you quack like a
                            duck so why don't we agree that you're a duck?</q> That's how he put it. </p>
                    <p> And so from 2002 we became, in April in 2002, we were formally brought into
                        the School of Humanities as an academic department. We had some discussions
                        at the time about whether to change the name from centre to department and
                        we decided that, we felt we were just becoming established in the humanities
                        computing frame, as we called it then, as an entity and that it would be,
                        for brand recognition purposes, it would be not necessarily the best move to
                        change the name. In retrospect, I think that that was the wrong decision
                        because even up until the recent name change people still thought centre
                        meant that we weren't department, even within King's, and so names somehow
                        can mean more than they should. So, if we'd changed the name to department
                        in 2002, which is when we became a department, it probably would have been
                        beneficial in the longer term, but anyway, that's history. So that's the
                        sequence. We actually agreed the change of name from CCH to Department of
                        Digital Humanities, DDH, we thought that would be easy for people to
                        remember, in late 2009, early 2010. But as you probably know that there is
                        quite a lot of international attention paid to what was happening in the
                        School of Humanities at King's. Fortunately, all the things that were
                        predicted didn't happen, so, for the most part, so that was, it has all
                        settled down a lot, it just meant that the school had no capacity to really
                        follow through on that at that stage. But then with my retirement and the
                        appointment of a new director, they used that opportunity to announce the
                        change of name to the Department of Digital Humanities. I have a feeling
                        that that sequence only addresses part of the question that you asked. </p>
                </sp>
                <sp>
                    <speaker>Nyhan</speaker>
                    <p> Well, I think it's a very good start, and as I said, we're definitely going
                        to be back to interview you again. So, in the last, we have a few minutes
                        left, I wanted to go just a small bit more in that direction and ask you to
                        reminisce about the perception traditional scholars had of using the
                        computer in research. So you know, obviously the fact that your mission has
                        been to show that DH is not service indicates that it was often perceived as
                        service and I was wondering if you would discuss that a little bit more?
                    </p>
                </sp>
                <sp>
                    <speaker>Short</speaker>
                    <p> I think that perception within King's was not anything like as widespread as
                        elsewhere. Just, it's [a] little bit of an aside, but I think we were helped by
                        the fact that European attitudes in general and UK attitudes specifically
                        about what in North America is the staff-faculty divide, is nothing like as
                        pronounced. So, the fact that we were doing, involved in doing, the
                        technical part of a research project, the technical research within a
                        research project, didn't mean that people automatically assumed we shouldn't
                        be because we were to begin with in the computing services area. So that
                        meant the transition from being first of all almost entirely service
                        oriented and then gradually, as you will have gathered from the chronology,
                        gradually moving more and more into academic work and away from support and
                        service, and then into becoming an academic department. That transition was
                        much easier than I think it would have been in any North American
                        institution that I know, and then it was easier than in some UK institutions
                        that I can think of but I think there the long tradition of humanities
                        computing helped and the fact that the engine for the development were the
                        research projects, and you know, nothing succeeds like success. You start
                        landing big research projects with distinguished international scholars, and
                        then other people want to be on board and they assume that's how it should
                        be done. So if your role with this distinguished professor and that
                        distinguished professor has been as research partners and they valued that,
                        then their colleagues assume that's how it should be. Within King's, we had
                        much less of an issue than we might have done at some other institutions. I
                        come back again to the excellence of the scholars we worked with — I think
                        that was a big big factor. Now, that's only part of what you're asking
                        about, I think. </p>
                    <p> One of the things that came to my mind as you asked me that question, and
                        stop me if this is too far away from what you really wanted to know, is that
                        a lot of it came down, as always, to interpersonal relationships and we had
                        the experience over and over again of working with a scholar who simply at
                        the outset didn't understand what the potential might be. If I think of one
                        particular [instance], there's a lovely lady called Janet Nelson who is a
                        fellow of the British Academy and who is a former president of the Royal
                        Historical Society, one of the, probably the world's leading historian of
                        Carolingian history. ... <!-- Can't work out what is being said --> I got to
                        know [Professor Nelson] quite well and between the two of us, we kept saying,
                        you know <q>we think this is a really interesting project that we could do
                            together</q> and it took several years. But then, once she got engaged
                        with us, she became our biggest supporter within the institution. And just
                        one other anecdote if that's OK, [we worked] with a very distinguished 13th
                        century historian who wanted to develop an edition of the Fine Rolls of
                        Henry the 3rd. If you don't know, a fine at stage was any kind of payment to
                        the king, these days it's a penalty payment. And so, he was told by this
                        other historian I mentioned (Nelson) that he must come and talk to us if he
                        wanted to-, he wanted to do an edition of these fine rolls. She said: <q>You
                            have to talk to CCH, otherwise you're simply not going get the money,
                            nor will it be worth doing.</q> So he — because she told him that he
                        must do this — he came [to CCH], but it was clear from the outset that he
                        didn't know why we were supposed to be talking. But he went through the
                        motions, he is a lovely fellow, very courteous and polite, he went through
                        the motions and everything was fine as so often is the case until we got to
                        the budget side of things. We got far enough along that we were preparing
                        the proposal and then it became clear that if we were going to have a
                        research role he couldn't have two full time researchers funded for history
                        because at that time the Arts and Humanities Research [Council] (AHRC), well
                        they still do, has a ceiling, so your whole bit had to be under a particular
                        limit. So, then he went back to Professor Nelson and said: <q>We can't
                            afford this.</q> And she said: <q>If you think you can't afford it, then
                            you better go and talk to Harold again, because I can tell you, you're
                            not going to get the money if you don't involve some technical research,
                            because there will be something valuable that's needed there.</q> So he
                        came back to see me and he said: <q>I'm sorry, but you're going have to go
                            through all this again, because I haven't really understood it.</q> So
                        we went through some of the same old things again and he suddenly stopped
                        and said: <q>So are you telling me that if we develop the kind of resource
                            that you're describing, using the kinds of methods that you're
                            describing, that if I want to find, to retrieve, all those fines in
                            Lincolnshire between 1260 and 1280 that related to the establishment of
                            markets that I will be able to do that?</q> And I said: <q>Yes, that's
                            one of the things that you will be able to do.</q> And it was like, you
                        know, that was his Damascene moment — he suddenly started to understand. And
                        now, the AHRC talk about it as one of their flagship projects, and he is
                        delighted with everything that has happened, and it's been a really fruitful
                        collaboration. But it required that kind of, I mean that's a particular
                        example, but it's that kind of negotiation all along the way and it has to
                        be true of any kind of collaborative research, the collaboration has got to
                        be fundamental or it's not gonna work. Everybody has got to understand that
                        the other person has something to contribute. </p>
                </sp>
                <sp>
                    <speaker>Nyhan</speaker>
                    <p> For certain. Anne, is there anything that you would like to add? </p>
                </sp>
                <sp>
                    <speaker>Anne Welsh</speaker>
                    <p> The only thing that struck me was you mentioned way way back at the start of
                        the interview some, I think you said French universities that were involved.
                        I think it was when you were talking about the first conference or just
                        before then and they stopped being involved? That instantly piqued my
                        interest, because one of the things that we're investigating in the other
                        strand of the project is this transience and people moving through the
                        field, so I wondered if you could fill us in a little bit on either them in
                        particular or that idea of transience, people coming in at the early days
                        and going out again? </p>
                </sp>
                <sp>
                    <speaker>Short</speaker>
                    <p> To provide a real answer to that I'd really want do some research, cause I
                        think it's something that's really interesting. I can give you my
                        un-researched [view] but it is very impressionistic, I'll say that, and I
                        think it would be interesting to do proper research on that. One of the
                        things that I would do for example, and I have thought about doing this, is
                        go back to the speakers at the Toronto conference and indeed the next two or
                        three conferences and then see what's happened to them, cause they-, many of
                        those people have disappeared from view. I suspect there are two ... key
                        [reasons]: one, that the interests of those particular scholars took
                        different directions, in which they no longer saw that the new computing
                        developments would be of particular interest to them, and of course, if
                        you're a pioneer, unless you are willing to continue to be a pioneer, unless
                        you're willing to live with constant change, then it can become very
                        unsettling. So I'm not attributing this to any individual, cause I don't
                        know enough but I suspect that that's one of the issues. And some of them
                        were quite mature scholars at the time, and so it may just be that they
                        retired ... I think at that stage there was more the atmosphere of what,
                        I've heard someone describe as <q>boutique research</q> in a sense that it
                        was an individual doing things that he or she was interested in doing and
                        producing, what John Unsworth has called <q>first generation resources.</q>
                        So I think that's part of the issue. </p>
                    <p> Another is, and I think this is perhaps more relevant to the development of
                        particular centres or whatever, and this could sound like hubris and I don't
                        intend that way, but when I'm asked about, as I mentioned before, when I'm
                        asked about why we were successful in establishing CCH in the way that we
                        did and getting it to a departmental status and so on, in addition to
                        mentioning the excellence of scholars, another thing I mentioned and it's in
                        some way related too, is embeddedness — that by the time the issue came up of
                        whether the information services would keep us or not, the School of
                        Humanities already believed that we were so essential to their future that
                        they wanted us to come in as part of the school. And I know of other
                        institutions and I won't name names, but I know of other institutions where
                        there were very thriving, I will mention Toronto actually, because I think
                        it's an example, and Willard McCarty would be able to tell you in more
                        detail about it, where the centre, there were thriving centres for computing
                        in the humanities, but they weren't embedded, they were appendices to the
                        institution, and so when a new senior administrator came in and he had cuts
                        to make, then where did they look first? They look at the appendices, the
                        appendages, to see who they can dispense with, and if you're not embedded
                        then no one particular group is going to fight for your survival. So I think
                        that's another factor. I'm sure there are other factors, and as I say this
                        is impressionistic rather than properly researched but, for what it's worth
                        ... </p>

                    <speaker>Welsh</speaker>
                    <p> No, that's very valuable to us. Particularly the embeddedness factor that
                        you mentioned gives us something to investigate that I certainly hadn't
                        thought of, although I should have because I'm a librarian and I've been a
                        library manager and it's exactly that issue that kills a lot of library
                        services but I hadn't thought about that [at the] high strategic level that
                        you've had from being very senior in the profession, so that's fantastic.
