                  <p>The digital archive “Nahuatl/Nawat in Central America”
                     (NECA) assembles and makes publicly available a growing corpus of Nahuan-language
                     documents produced in Spanish Central America. Many are fragments within larger
                     Spanish-language documents and difficult to locate in the archive. NECA has succeeded
                     in bringing attention to this understudied corpus but has so far failed to attract
                     users to its transcription and translation tool. We consider the reasons for this
                     creative failure based on user data, and suggest that the specialized skills and
                     distinct academic communities needed to move this project forward require other
                     workspaces, including the non-digital, in advance of online collaboration.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e178">[1]</a></p>

                  White reminded his fellow historians of the extent to which history's content is
                  dictated by the form of its presentation. Annals, chronicles, biographies, narrative,
                  and discursive analyses all entail “ontological and epistemic
                  choices with distinct ideological and even specifically political
                  implications”
                  [<a class="ref" href="#white1987">White 1987</a>, ix]. Here, we adapt White's title to make a similar

                  by its form independent of the creator's intent, here we examine the curatorial
                  decisions we made regarding NECA's form in order to intentionally impact the reception,
                  use, and utility of its content.

               <div class="ptext" id="p2">NECA assembles a corpus of handwritten, colonial-era texts produced in Central America
                  in variations of the related Mesoamerican languages Nahuatl and Nawat, from eight
                  repositories in Guatemala, Mexico, Spain, and the United States. It emphasizes the
                  fact
                  that these oft-ignored documents exist, and encourages their collaborative study across
                  national, scholarly, community, and disciplinary lines. Neither goal is neutral or
                  apolitical, although the significance of studying these texts may vary depending on
                  whether the user is an indigenous rights activist from Mexico City or Los Angeles,
                  a
                  linguist in Mayan languages from Guatemala, a native speaker from Guerrero, a primary
                  school teacher from El Salvador, or a doctoral candidate from Europe, etc. In this
                  essay
                  we explain our rationale for creating a digital archive of Nahuatl texts from Central
                  America in the first place, arguing that NECA's content should be studied not only
                  by
                  individuals analyzing particular texts for the purposes of geographically or
                  disciplinarily bounded research and revitalization projects, but also collaboratively
                  and more experimentally as a standalone corpus. We then review the ontological and
                  epistemic as well as technical choices we made in the project's design to encourage
                  this
                  outcome. NECA's form attempts to prod users towards a variety of actions both within
                  and
                  outside the digital archive. The success or failure of the affordances we created
                  to
                  increase the usefulness and usability of the site, and thus to direct the user toward
                  specific activities, can be measured in the site's analytics. These indicate not just
                  where the digital environment we created is working well or can be improved, but also
                  where it may not be the best workspace available — or at least, not yet.

                     partially due to an apparent lack of material. Such appearances, however, are
                     deceiving. The largest repositories of colonial-era documents from Central America
                     outside of Spain are located in Chiapas and Guatemala, both of which have significant
                     Maya populations. Mayan language documents from these regions are therefore highly
                     valued, highlighted in archival catalogs, and may even be removed from their original
                     context to become standalone documents.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e385">[3]</a> By contrast, documents
                     in Nahuan languages are fragmentary, rarely noted as such, and often remain hidden
                     inside bundles of Spanish-language legal papers. Historians of Spanish Guatemala
                     typically rely on scribal Spanish translations of Nahuan language text, while Maya
                     linguists and language revitalization activists tend to view historical writing in
                     Nahuan languages as a colonial-era imposition that has little to offer their project
                     of fortifying Mayan languages for future generations and recovering Mayan historical

                     2009, Lockhart 1991, Pizzigoni 2007, Olko and Sullivan 2013]. Historians have used
                     such bureaucratic and legal documentation to track political, sociocultural and
                     linguistic changes in Mesoamerica as a result of European colonialism, and to uncover
                     regional and subregional variations of the language. They have done so by
                     systematically assembling, transcribing, translating, cataloguing the characteristics
                     of, and comparatively analyzing various corpora of Nahuatl documents. This
                     methodology holds great promise for NECA. With transcriptions and translations — to
                     date, an aspirational goal — we would be able to create a database of dialectal and
                     other linguistic features, locations, genres, scribes' names, year of creation, etc.,
                     which would surely yield new insights into the history of Nahuatl's diffusion,
                     scribal and ecclesiastical networks, relationship to geography, and other avenues
                     of
                     future research. Beyond philology, translations and transcriptions of the documents

                     of

                     Oaxacan plantation workers, Maya choirmasters and cofradía officials, French
                     merchants, and innumerous indigenous political leaders: Mam, K'iche', Tzeltal,
                     Tojolabal, Jakalteko, Kaqchikel, etc. Contact points between friars, Spanish
                     administrators, and local authorities are also plentiful in these documents. Family
                     relations simmer underneath accusations of adultery, bigamy, and incest. Inventories
                     and wills track the material culture of everyday life and the globalization of
                     Mesoamerican commerce. Witchcraft, land and inheritance disputes, and the forced
                     labor of women all make an appearance. The input of scholars and community members
                     who may not have Nahuan language skills but who bring deep expertise in Mayan and
                     Central American history, anthropology, archaeology, geography, and art history is

                     is uncertain, in part, because the linguistic identification of so many of our
                     documents remains unclear and the majority are from Guatemala, where Nawat was

                     dozen other colleagues, for an encyclopedia project that never materialized. As

                     surface. It became clear that given the number of Nahuan language documents that go
                     unrecorded in archive catalogs and the extent to which scholars tend to run across
                     them unexpectedly, the list could easily grow longer and a traditional print
                     publication would quickly become outdated. Simply posting the list online might
                     stimulate interest, but the need to travel to physical archives represented a
                     significant barrier to serious engagement since those with the most capacity to read
                     early modern manuscripts in Nahuan languages tend not to live or work in Guatemala

                     repositories, Matthew decided in 2015 to create a digital archive of high-quality

                     collections from the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media (CHNM) at George
                     Mason University. For the remainder of this essay, “we” refers to Matthew and
                     Bannister as the sole creators and curators of NECA. Our first curatorial decision
                     was conceptual: to restrict the archive's geographical range to Central America as
                     defined by colonial-era administrative boundaries. This meant including documents
                     from Chiapas but not from neighboring and similarly multilingual places like Oaxaca,
                     where Nahuatl also functioned as a vehicular <em class="term">lingua franca</em>
                     [<a class="ref" href="#terraciano2001">Terraciano 2001</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#swanton2008">Swanton 2008</a>]. Segregating Oaxaca from Central America seemed in some
                     ways artificial and over-determined by the same national, academic, and disciplinary
                     boundaries NECA aspires to overcome. But such boundaries are both real and
                     significant. At a practical level, we accumulated items from Chiapas but not Oaxaca
                     by default, because Chiapas’s colonial records were sent to the judicial Audiencia
                     of
                     Guatemala while Oaxaca's were sent to Mexico. Linguistically speaking, a Central
                     American focus also directed attention to the contact points between Mayan and Nahuan
                     languages. We did not want the Central American material to be prematurely absorbed
                     into the considerably more developed academic literature on Nahuatl in Oaxaca and
                     elsewhere in Mexico, without a proper understanding of the local contexts that
                     produced it. We also took seriously Justyna Olko's and John Sullivan's assertion that
                     “more research on this topic [of local and regional
                     differences and their relation to standardization] is greatly needed; especially
                     useful would be a systematic comparison between regions as well as between higher
                     and lower-ranking scribes/authors within a given locality”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#olko2013">Olko and Sullivan 2013</a>, 192]. A distinctly Central American corpus creates the
                     possibility of comparative study with data sets from other multilingual, borderland,
                     and outlying regions where Nahuatl was and is spoken, such as Oaxaca, Jalisco,
                     Veracruz, and Guerrero [<a class="ref" href="#canger2017">Canger 2017</a>]

                     [<a class="ref" href="#yanezrosales2017">Yañez Rosales 2017</a>]. Finally, by drawing a line around Central America
                     we hoped to direct attention towards and raise awareness of the ongoing, severely
                     underfunded, but multi-pronged efforts to revitalize Nawat in El Salvador. As we
                     began to build the site, created and solicited feedback from an advisory board, and
                     presented at conferences in the United States, Guatemala, and El Salvador,
                     overlapping and mismatched interests in the NECA corpus became increasingly apparent.
                     Historians, anthropologists, and archaeologists working in Central America were
                     enthusiastic about sharing their archival references and interested in the
                     information the documents contained, which they often could not read. Linguists and
                     philologists working primarily in Mexico were interested in the dialectal features
                     of
                     the documents but were unfamiliar with their Central American context and history.
                     Scholars and activists working on Nahuan languages in Central America expressed
                     interest but lacked the financial and human resources to engage NECA without
                     diverting valuable attention from existing projects, especially those supporting
                     revitalization of Nawat in El Salvador. We began to think about how NECA’s structure
                     could more actively facilitate communication across these disciplinary, regional,
                     and
                     national borders. Unlocking the information inside the documents would be the
                     essential first step for any kind of macro-analysis of the entire corpus,
                     computational or otherwise, and for connecting scholars with similar interests and
                     complementary skills. Could we help scholars find not just the documents, but each
                     other? Could we create an online workspace that encouraged scholars to share their
                     expertise and begin to generate data for comparative and collaborative analysis?
                     Taking inspiration from crowdsourcing projects such as <cite class="title italic">Colored
                        Conventions</cite> (which has since retired this feature) (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150322130256/http:/coloredconventions.org" onclick="window.open('https://web.archive.org/web/20150322130256/http:/coloredconventions.org'); return false" class="ref">https://web.archive.org/web/20150322130256/http://coloredconventions.org</a>)
                     and <cite class="title italic">DIY History</cite> (<a href="https://diyhistory.lib.uiowa.edu/" onclick="window.open('https://diyhistory.lib.uiowa.edu/'); return false" class="ref">https://diyhistory.lib.uiowa.edu</a>), we added the transcription plugin Scripto,
                     and created an “Add a Document” feature using a Simple Contact Form plugin to
                     encourage contributions of new documents. A separate, linked Wordpress site (<a href="https://nahuatlnawat.wordpress.com/" onclick="window.open('https://nahuatlnawat.wordpress.com/'); return false" class="ref">https://nahuatlnawat.wordpress.com</a>) became the project blog and discussion
                     space. The backbone of Omeka is the items list, supported by Dublin Core-based
                     metadata. Most metadata elements are obvious: date, title, source, etc. Nevertheless,
                     each element reflects a curatorial decision made by us with certain goals in mind.
                     We
                     added new metadata elements for the number of “folios” to emphasize the variety
                     and extent of the corpus, and for at-a-glance decisions by users about whether or
                     not
                     to transcribe; “sample text” to spark the potential transcriber's and/or
                     translator's interest; “location” with the modern countries, states, and/or
                     departments in addition to the colonial-era information to allow for sub-regional
                     searches and future experiments in mapping; “date of creation” of the item
                     itself to keep a record of the corpus's growth; and the “contributor” of the
                     document in order to acknowledge her or his research and participation. Metadata
                     omissions also reveal the synergy between form, content, and curation. A primary goal
                     of NECA is to encourage the linguistic study of a larger corpus of Nahuan documents
                     from Central America than usual, and eventually to gather the results in a database
                     of linguistic features for comparative analysis. Some of our documents conform to
                     a
                     single, clear Nahuan variant. Most, however, present a mix of attributes, as one
                     might expect of writing produced by non-native speakers in a context of ongoing (or
                     decreasing) standardization, colonial power dynamics, and the adoption by indigenous
                     people of foreign writing technologies. This linguistic heterogeneity makes the NECA
                     corpus an exceedingly valuable resource for exploring the history of Nahuan languages
                     at linguistic borderlands [<a class="ref" href="#madajczak2016">Madajczak and Hansen 2016</a>, 239]. We chose not to
                     create a metadata element that prematurely assigned the documents a reductive
                     linguistic label until we have more data through transcription and analysis. We also
                     wanted to avoid a situation in which non-linguists might interpret such labels as
                     more definitive than they really are. Decisions about the items themselves
                     predetermine what researchers can and cannot do with them. Most of NECA's items are
                     fragments within larger documents — sometimes, much larger. On a mostly non-existent
                     budget, we faced issues of server space, labor, and funding: photographers require
                     payment, repositories may charge publication fees. Additionally, in this first
                     iteration of the project we were focused on access and translation. We therefore
                     chose to publish only the Nahuatl portions of any given document, for both practical
                     reasons and in order to attract Nahuatl translators. This decision has consequences.
                     For better or worse, it denies the user access to any Spanish translation that might
                     have appeared in the original document. It also separates the fragment from its
                     larger documentary context, digitally replicating the same de-contextualization that
                     has been suffered by many Mayan-language documents. A fuller understanding of the
                     document's creation and information can only be achieved by consulting the original
                     document in relation to its archival context. Data sets of people, places, and other
                     kinds of information contained in the digital archive — for instance, paying
                     attention to geographical location or scribal networks — will also remain incomplete
                     without access to the full original. Researchers will have to return to the physical
                     archives in order to get the whole picture, and we run the danger that they will not
                     [<a class="ref" href="#putnam2016">Putnam 2016</a>]. Finally, anticipating the user experience led to some
                     programming alterations. Omeka's automatically generated citations omitted the
                     original archive; we changed the code to cite the document's physical repository and
                     archival signature first, followed by NECA and the date of access. To guide users
                     towards specific activities, we turned Omeka's “featured items” into a “sample
                     transcription” and “featured collections” into “document teams.”
                     Omeka's built-in internationalization combined with the plugin Locale Switcher made
                     the site bilingual, allowing users to choose in real time whether to view the site
                     in
                     Spanish or English. Because we had significantly altered the standard Omeka framework
                     with new navigation headings, metadata categories, etc., Spanish versions had to be
                     added to the internationalization code, as did all Spanish translations of all the
                     text within the transcription tool Scripto. However, these changes affected only the
                     user interface, not the items' metadata. Assuming that most of our users would be
                     competent in Spanish but not necessarily in English, we decided to make Spanish the
                     primary language of the site (and in doing so, officially baptized it as NECA: in
                     Spanish, <cite class="title italic">El Náhuatl/náhuat en Centroamérica</cite>). All

                     –
                     the digital archive – produces a flurry of new publications and dissertations created
                     outside our platform, this will be a positive result. NECA nevertheless encourages
                     scholars to go beyond individual documents and to work beyond their comfort zones.
                     It
                     identifies common research interests across disciplines and national and academic
                     communities, and presents the opportunity to share citations, translations, and
                     knowledge in a public forum; to compare notes online; and eventually, given
                     transcriptions and translations, to create databases, analyze the corpus as a whole,
                     and experiment with different digital and computational tools. The NECA corpus is
                     large and geographically varied enough to reveal not only the dialectal features of
                     Nahuan languages in Central America, but also the documents’ production related to
                     colonial settlement, ecclesiastical influence, social and political networks, the
                     economy, and geography. We see great future value, especially, in thinking through
                     NECA’s data using spatial analysis and mapping tools. Bringing linguists and
                     translators of Nahuatl together with non-<em class="term">nahuatlato</em> scholars of Central
                     America has the potential to advance all this research further, faster. We built NECA
                     to nudge people in this collaborative direction. The question is, will they come?
                     So
                     far, the answer is yes and no. NECA's analytics from Reclaim Hosting show that since
                     the digital archive went online in July 2016, it has received the most intensive and
                     consistent use (measured by bandwidth used, the ratio of pages to hits, and annual
                     location data) from Mexico, El Salvador, and Guatemala, as well as Spain, Germany,
                     Poland, and France in Europe — the last three being major centers of Mesoamerican
                     and
                     Nahuatl studies — and the United States, Brazil, and Canada in the Americas.
                     Presentations at the University of Texas at Austin in March 2017, the Congreso de
                     Estudios Mayas in Guatemala City in July 2017, the Asociación Centroamericana de
                     Lingüística annual meeting in San Salvador in August 2017, the American Historical
                     Association annual meeting in January 2018, and the Sociedad Mexicana de
                     Historiografía Lingüística in Mexico City in October 2018, each produced temporary
                     bumps in the number of unique visitors and/or intensity of use, which then tapered
                     off. The Austin presentation acted as an official launch of the project with the
                     power of social media behind it, resulting in an eighteen-fold increase in unique
                     visitors immediately afterwards (March-April 2017). Subsequent presentations in
                     Guatemala and El Salvador produced the most remarkable user data in the site's
                     history thus far. In the two months following (July-August 2017) — and with no
                     official social media push — the number of unique visitors to the site quadrupled.
                     More importantly, the bandwidth and pages-to-hits ratio indicated significantly more
                     searching through the site's most complex pages, such as those containing document
                     images, than after the Austin presentation. The Central Americans' more intensive

                  <div class="ptext" id="p15">From 2016 through 2018, the United States and Ukraine generated most of the site’s
                     hundreds of thousands of page views, 75% of which lasted thirty seconds or less.
                     Presumably, a large portion of these were bots. The next largest proportions of
                     visits, however, lasted for over one hour (around 8%), thirty minutes to an hour
                     (around 6%), and fifteen to thirty minutes (around 4%), suggesting that a significant
                     minority of users were seriously engaging the site. Notably, when we ceased to
                     actively promote the site in 2019 we saw a drop in unique visitors, a consistent
                     narrowing of the pages-to-hits ratio indicating shallower exploration of the site,
                     and 88% of visits lasting less than thirty seconds. (For the first time, a large
                     number of such visits in 2019 came from the Netherlands, bumping Ukraine to third
                     place in the “probably a bot” category). Nevertheless, in 2019 the most
                     intensive users — those spending thirty minutes to over an hour on the site at a time
                     — still constituted our next largest user group, or 7% of the total number of visits.
                     As a digital archive, therefore, NECA is doing reasonably well even when we do not
                     take advantage of conferences, social media, and other means to publicize and promote
                     it. As an online platform for collaborative transcription, it has been less
                     successful. A few people have used the “Add a Document” feature to provide new
                     citations and high-quality images, but most of the 19 new documents added since the
                     site’s inception have come from our own research or direct outreach. The same is true
                     of the Discussion area, where invited essays by Janine Gasco on Nahuan agricultural
                     terms in the Soconusco and by Adriana Álvarez on Nahuatl instruction at the
                     Universidad de San Carlos in Guatemala have generated a handful of comments from
                     community members mostly from El Salvador or of Salvadoran descent in the United
                     States, but no serious scholarly engagement, without which we cannot move forward
                     to
                     better understand why, how, or to whom these documents might be important. The
                     document teams and Scripto's transcription tool have attracted no users at all since
                     beta testing in March 2017. This may be a design issue. This first iteration of NECA
                     is based on a pre-designed Omeka platform and utilizes only the Scripto features made
                     available through the plug-in. Certainly we could improve the transcription and
                     translation tool to be more appealing and effective, including a simpler user
                     interface, better versioning, an improved commenting feature that identifies the user
                     and is always visible, side-by-side images and workspace, progress bars, and the
                     ability to toggle between transcriptions, translations, and versioning on a single
                     page. The features and functionality of the transcription tool at the <cite class="title italic">Codex Aubin</cite> project, hosted on software developer Ben
                     Brumfield's transcription platform FromThePage based on Ruby on Rails (<a href="https://fromthepage.com/" onclick="window.open('https://fromthepage.com/'); return false" class="ref">https://fromthepage.com</a>), are exemplary
                     (<a href="https://fromthepage.ace.fordham.edu/benwbrum/codex-aubin" onclick="window.open('https://fromthepage.ace.fordham.edu/benwbrum/codex-aubin'); return false" class="ref">https://fromthepage.ace.fordham.edu/benwbrum/codex-aubin</a>), as is the
                     transcription and search tool created for the <cite class="title italic">Freedom on the
                        Move </cite>project (<a href="https://freedomonthemove.org/index.html" onclick="window.open('https://freedomonthemove.org/index.html'); return false" class="ref">https://freedomonthemove.org/index.html</a>). Other projects with more
                     user-friendly transcription workspaces than NECA include the Newberry Library's
                     <cite class="title italic">Newberry Transcribes</cite> (<a href="https://publications.newberry.org/digital/mms-transcribe/index" onclick="window.open('https://publications.newberry.org/digital/mms-transcribe/index'); return false" class="ref">https://publications.newberry.org/digital/mms-transcribe/index</a>) and
                     Maynooth University's <cite class="title italic">Letters 1916-1923</cite> (<a href="http://letters1916.maynoothuniversity.ie/learn" onclick="window.open('http://letters1916.maynoothuniversity.ie/learn'); return false" class="ref">http://letters1916.maynoothuniversity.ie/learn</a>), both of which are based on
                     Omeka and Scripto. How the digital archive's form can encourage engagement with its
                     content is not, however, only a design issue. The most successful transcription
                     projects come from outward-facing institutions digitizing items from their physical
                     archives and making them available to “citizen humanists” with the clear goal of
                     public engagement — for instance (among many other examples), the Smithsonian
                     Institution's <cite class="title italic">Digital Volunteers </cite>initiative (<a href="https://transcription.si.edu/" onclick="window.open('https://transcription.si.edu/'); return false" class="ref">https://transcription.si.edu</a>) and the
                     Library of Virginia's <cite class="title italic">Making History</cite> project (<a href="http://www.virginiamemory.com/transcribe" onclick="window.open('http://www.virginiamemory.com/transcribe'); return false" class="ref">http://www.virginiamemory.com/transcribe</a>). Often, featured collections are
                     chosen with audience interest and capabilities in mind. The Stanford University
                     Archives (<a href="https://library.stanford.edu/spc/university-archives" onclick="window.open('https://library.stanford.edu/spc/university-archives'); return false" class="ref">https://library.stanford.edu/spc/university-archives</a>), for example, invites
                     online transcription of manuscripts related to the university's history, in English.
                     Broad or targeted appeal of the subject matter, readability of the documents, and
                     language accessibility seem equally relevant to the success of the aforementioned
                     <cite class="title italic">Freedom on the Move Project</cite>, which crowdsources
                     transcriptions of mostly English, printed newspaper announcements of rewards for
                     runaway African-American slaves; <cite class="title italic">Newberry Transcribes</cite>,
                     which presents mostly English-language diaries and letters about family life in the
                     Midwest; and the narrower but commemorative <cite class="title italic">Letters
                        1916-1923</cite>, which invites visitors to submit and transcribe their own
                     family's documents for upcoming anniversaries of the Easter Rising, World War I, and
                     the Irish War of Independence and Civil War. A search through the transcription
                     platform FromThePage's various collections suggests that more academic projects often
                     involve fewer participants, especially where handwritten manuscripts from earlier
                     time periods with idiosyncratic paleography in languages other than English are
                     concerned. Online transcription in these circumstances seems to work best as a
                     collaboration tool between professors and students, or between small groups of
                     colleagues with similar skills. This is the case of the <cite class="title italic">Codex
                        Aubin</cite> and <cite class="title italic">French from Outremer</cite> (<a href="https://fromthepage.ace.fordham.edu/collection/show?collection_id=1" onclick="window.open('https://fromthepage.ace.fordham.edu/collection/show?collection_id=1'); return false" class="ref">https://fromthepage.ace.fordham.edu/collection/show?collection_id=1</a>)
                     projects from Fordham University, which deal with medieval and early modern
                     manscripts in Nahuatl and French requiring highly specialized transcribers. Many
                     digital archives of similarly challenging material rely entirely on professional
                     teams and do not make collaborative online transcription tools available, for
                     instance the <cite class="title italic">BFM - Base de Français Médiéval</cite> (<a href="http://txm.bfm-corpus.org/" onclick="window.open('http://txm.bfm-corpus.org/'); return false" class="ref">txm.bfm-corpus.org</a>), the <cite class="title italic">1641 Depositions Project</cite> from Trinity College, Ireland (<a href="http://1641.tcd.ie/project.php" onclick="window.open('http://1641.tcd.ie/project.php'); return false" class="ref">http://1641.tcd.ie/project.php</a>), and
                     the <cite class="title italic">Native Northeast Research Collaborative</cite> (<a href="https://www.thenativenortheast.org/" onclick="window.open('https://www.thenativenortheast.org/'); return false" class="ref">https://www.thenativenortheast.org</a>). Comparing these projects, and NECA, to
                     the <cite class="title italic">Ticha</cite> project described in this issue by Broadwell
                     et al. makes clear that the challenges faced by creators of digital archives are
                     highly contingent. As a digital archive and online transcription platform for
                     colonial-era texts in Zapotec languages from Oaxaca, <cite class="title italic">Ticha</cite> encountered some of the same design limitations as NECA when using
                     software such as Scripto and the Fieldworks Language Explorer (FLEx) <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#broadwell2020">#broadwell2020</a></span>
                     [<a class="ref" href="#broadwell2013">Broadwell and Lillehaugen 2013</a>]. <cite class="title italic">Ticha</cite> was aided by the
                     fact that the interests of Zapotec speakers and scholars, ethnohistorians, and
                     linguists converged on the same region and language, as opposed to the criss-crossing
                     and sometimes conflicting interests faced by NECA. However, <cite class="title italic">Ticha</cite> is also a powerful example of what sustained attention to the human
                     side of digital projects — conferences and workshops, acceptance and accommodation
                     of
                     a wide range of user communities, and outreach especially to non-academic
                     stakeholders, in this case native speakers of Indigenous and minority languages —
                     can
                     achieve. To re-design the weakest link of NECA, its transcription tool, would require
                     at minimum a switch from the current pre-designed website and/or outsourcing of the
                     tool, and possibly changing from WikiMedia to a standalone database. It is not clear
                     that, at this stage of the project, the effort would be worth it. While some have
                     expressed interest in using the site as a teaching tool for advanced students who
                     are
                     simultaneously learning Nahuatl and paleography, there is no way to know whether this
                     is happening. Likewise, if more established scholars are working with documents from
                     NECA, they are doing outside the context of the site. At a practical level, scholars
                     may find online transcription and translation, which requires working within the
                     confines of the program and/or between multiple formats, less efficient than
                     traditional methods. They may also appreciate opportunities for face-to-face
                     discussion prior to performing their work online. Scholarship is risky and takes
                     time. Sturdy, creative collaborations between people who have not traditionally
                     worked together — such as the local, national, disciplinary, and academic networks
                     that have expressed interest in NECA yet remain siloed from each other — may
                     initially develop better in person. Rather than immediately overhauling the site or
                     the transcription tool, a better next step for NECA may be more old-fashioned: to
                     convene scholars and community members in different combinations and venues, with
                     the
                     goal of creating collaborative teams and identifying viable research questions and
                     interests in common. Digital humanities promises more than a new marriage between
                     mathematical, qualitative, and design methodologies and tools. It also proposes a
                     paradigmatic change in how scholars collaborate, flattening research and/or learning
                     communities and vaunting an idealized, non-hierarchical community where people
                     willingly share their research, promote interdisciplinarity, and work in teams of
                     members with complementary skills sets, none of which is seen as more important than
                     another. Despite the ways in which this mimics Silicon Valley-ese (rightly criticized
                     for its hypocrisy), there is much to hold onto here: the potential of digital
                     humanities to communicate with broader publics, to democratize the production of
                     knowledge, to make the fruits of scholarship more accessible, and to make us all more
                     flexible thinkers. As NECA argues, digital archives also have the potential to push
                     scholarship in certain directions by calling attention to understudied texts or
                     problematics and by making the materials for studying them available. But the digital
                     humanities’ optimistic, even utopian view of the scholarly workplace is tinged with
                     disciplinary, financial, and intergenerational anxieties. In the United States,
                     humanities scholars of all stripes fear the devaluation of their work in the
                     information age. The younger generation faces an increasingly freelance economy and
                     shrinking humanities job market from the peculiar position of being simultaneously
                     valued for their digital savvy (writing code, understanding algorithms, managing
                     project teams, marketing their work), expected to be innovators and
                     jacks-of-all-trades, and suspected of not doing the kinds of specialized research
                     that got their professorly elders tenure. Established scholars are suspected of
                     lagging behind the digital turn, but have more freedom to experiment with digital
                     tools — or not — with far less risk to their future careers. They are also the
                     gatekeepers of the academy. It is therefore incumbent upon senior scholars,
                     especially, to ponder the lessons of creative failure in digital humanities projects.
                     NECA shows the potential for digital archiving to turn a wide range of people's
                     attention towards a particular corpus of historical documentation and set of
                     questions. NECA also highlights the difficulty of attracting scholars to
                     skills-intensive transcription and translation online in collaborative projects
                     without prior commitments, goals, and relationships in common. While we maintain the
                     first iteration of the NECA digital archive, our next best step for transcription
                     and
                     translation — the necessary building blocks of any future database — will involve
                     human, not digital, development: recruiting and funding new team members, acquiring
                     grant money to pay for skilled transcriptions and translations, and organizing
                     conferences. With data in hand and new ideas on the table, we can start to
                     contemplate smaller, more limited digital tools — what Rockwell and Sinclair [2016]
                     call "embeddable toys" – for scholars to play with, exploring what value computation
                     might bring to the analysis of the entire NECA corpus. To move forward we must
                     forcefully argue for the funding of <em class="emph">both</em> methods of scholarship, digital
                     and traditional, most especially for those who will be the generators, guardians,
                     and
                     teachers of Nahuatl and Nawat in the future.

                     Spanish, “Nahuatl” and “Nawat” in English, are currently the most
                     conventional ways of referencing these related but distinct languages. As Hansen 2016
                     explains, the orthographic conventions of Nahuan languages are fluid and we do not
                     intend any definitive statement by selecting these particular ones. On the politics
                     of orthography and revitalization see also <a href="#olko2013">Olko

                     period Nawat was called “Pipil” or “mexicana corrupta” by the Spanish.
                     Both “Nawat” and “Pipil” are common terms for the same language spoken
                     in El Salvador today. To avoid confusion, in this article we refer only to
                     “Nawat.”</span></div>

                     removed from their original documentary context with no paper trail, within the

                     the state in which it arrived at the Newberry. The removal of texts from their
                     place of origin by antiquarian collectors and scholars, with permission or not,
                     represents yet another kind of decontextualization.</span></div>
