            <p>The digital archive <title rend="quotes">Nahuatl/Nawat in Central America</title>
               (NECA) assembles and makes publicly available a growing corpus of Nahuan-language
               documents produced in Spanish Central America. Many are fragments within larger
               Spanish-language documents and difficult to locate in the archive. NECA has succeeded
               in bringing attention to this understudied corpus but has so far failed to attract
               users to its transcription and translation tool. We consider the reasons for this
               creative failure based on user data, and suggest that the specialized skills and
               distinct academic communities needed to move this project forward require other
               workspaces, including the non-digital, in advance of online collaboration.<note>NECA
                  is a joint effort between the authors that has also depended on the generous
                  support of others. We thank Marquette University's College of Arts and Sciences
                  for start-up funding, Sergio Romero for helping assemble the core document list
                  and translations of sample text, Héctor Concohá Chet for photographing documents
                  in the Archivo General de Centroamérica in Guatemala City, Rafael Lara Martínez
                  for Spanish translations of the primary pages, and Jorge Lemus for his
                  collaboration in El Salvador. Ann Hanlon at the Digital Humanities Lab, University

         <p>Some thirty years ago, in <title rend="italic">The Content of the Form</title>, Hayden
            White reminded his fellow historians of the extent to which history's content is
            dictated by the form of its presentation. Annals, chronicles, biographies, narrative,
            and discursive analyses all entail <quote rend="inline">ontological and epistemic
               choices with distinct ideological and even specifically political
               implications</quote>
            <ptr target="#white1987" loc="ix"/>. Here, we adapt White's title to make a similar
            point about the digital archive <title rend="italic">El Náhuatl/Náhuat en
               Centroamérica</title> or in English, <title rend="italic">Nahuatl/Nawat in Central
               America</title> (NECA; <ref target="http://nahuatl-nawat.org/"
               >http://nahuatl-nawat.org</ref>).<note>The terms <q>Náhuatl</q> and <q>Náhuat</q> in
               Spanish, <q>Nahuatl</q> and <q>Nawat</q> in English, are currently the most
               conventional ways of referencing these related but distinct languages. As Hansen 2016
               explains, the orthographic conventions of Nahuan languages are fluid and we do not
               intend any definitive statement by selecting these particular ones. On the politics
               of orthography and revitalization see also <ref target="#olko2013" loc="201–11">Olko
                  and Sullivan 2013 esp. pp. 201-11</ref>, and <ref target="#vanzantwijk2011">van
                  Zantwijk 2011</ref>.</note> Whereas White focused on how content may be influenced
            by its form independent of the creator's intent, here we examine the curatorial
            decisions we made regarding NECA's form in order to intentionally impact the reception,
            use, and utility of its content.</p>
         <p>NECA assembles a corpus of handwritten, colonial-era texts produced in Central America
            in variations of the related Mesoamerican languages Nahuatl and Nawat, from eight
            repositories in Guatemala, Mexico, Spain, and the United States. It emphasizes the fact
            that these oft-ignored documents exist, and encourages their collaborative study across
            national, scholarly, community, and disciplinary lines. Neither goal is neutral or
            apolitical, although the significance of studying these texts may vary depending on
            whether the user is an indigenous rights activist from Mexico City or Los Angeles, a
            linguist in Mayan languages from Guatemala, a native speaker from Guerrero, a primary
            school teacher from El Salvador, or a doctoral candidate from Europe, etc. In this essay
            we explain our rationale for creating a digital archive of Nahuatl texts from Central
            America in the first place, arguing that NECA's content should be studied not only by
            individuals analyzing particular texts for the purposes of geographically or
            disciplinarily bounded research and revitalization projects, but also collaboratively
            and more experimentally as a standalone corpus. We then review the ontological and
            epistemic as well as technical choices we made in the project's design to encourage this
            outcome. NECA's form attempts to prod users towards a variety of actions both within and
            outside the digital archive. The success or failure of the affordances we created to
            increase the usefulness and usability of the site, and thus to direct the user toward
            specific activities, can be measured in the site's analytics. These indicate not just
            where the digital environment we created is working well or can be improved, but also
            where it may not be the best workspace available — or at least, not yet.</p>

            <head>The Content: Why Nahuatl in Central America?</head>
            <p>Nahuatl, best known as the language of the Aztec empire, was spoken by tens of
               millions of people in the early sixteenth century. It is not a single language but a
               range of mutually intelligible <q>Nahuan</q> variants ranging from northern Mexico to
               Nicaragua since at least the second half of the first millennium A.D. (see <ref
                  target="#figure01">Figures 1</ref> and <ref target="#figure02">2</ref>). Many
               Nahuan languages have died out, especially in the last 150 years. Others persist but
               are threatened by continued and increasing contact with and preference for European
               languages such as Spanish and English. Today, there are approximately 1.5 million
               native speakers of Nahuatl variants in Mexico and the United States disapora, and
               around 200 native speakers of the related language Nawat in the Izalcos and Santo
               Domingo de Guzmán areas of Sonsonate and in Tacuba, Ahuachapán, both in western El
               Salvador (<ref target="http://www.unesco.org/languages-atlas/index.php"
                  >http://www.unesco.org/languages-atlas/index.php</ref>).<note>In the colonial
                  period Nawat was called <q>Pipil</q> or <q>mexicana corrupta</q> by the Spanish.
                  Both <q>Nawat</q> and <q>Pipil</q> are common terms for the same language spoken
                  in El Salvador today. To avoid confusion, in this article we refer only to
                     <q>Nawat.</q></note> Nahuan languages in Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, and
               Nicaragua have largely ceased to exist.</p>

                  many other languages such as Totonacan, Xinka, and non-Nahuan languages of the
                  Uto-Aztecan branch.</head>

            <p>When the Spanish arrived in 1519, central Mexico was the most urbanized, politically
               powerful, and densely populated part of Mesoamerica. The Spanish made the defeated
               Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan the bureaucratic heart of their own nascent empire, and
               engaged Indigenous intellectuals in a remarkable, sometimes violent merging of
               Mesoamerican and European writing systems <ptr target="#mcdonough2014"/>
               <ptr target="#townsend2016"/>. This produced a significant amount and variety of
               Nahuatl written in Roman script that has been studied extensively, for centuries in
               Mexico and more recently in the United States and Europe.</p>
            <p>This large corpus of Nahuatl documentation from central Mexico has spawned a number
               of digital projects with a variety of aims, such as increasing access to lesser-known
               texts and making databases of glyphic and linguistic information searchable online
               for comparative study. For instance, the <title rend="italic">Compendio Enciclopédico
                  Náhuatl</title> (<ref target="http://cen.iib.unam.mx/"
                  >http://cen.iib.unam.mx/</ref>) links linguistic data from approximately twenty
               historical and modern Nahuatl dictionaries with separate databases of information
               from pictorial and alphabetic texts. The <title rend="italic">Nahuatl Dictionary
               </title>of the Wired Humanities Project at the University of Oregon (<ref
                  target="https://nahuatl.uoregon.edu/">https://nahuatl.uoregon.edu</ref>) allows
               users to search for attestations, headwords, and themes associated with any string of
               letters in English, Spanish, or Nahuatl, in order to compare usages in early modern
               Nahuatl from central Mexico as well as contemporary Nahuatl from the Huasteca,
               Veracruz. Also from Oregon, the <title rend="italic">Early Nahuatl Library</title>
               and the <title rend="italic">Mapas Project</title> (<ref
                  target="https://enl.uoregon.edu/">https://enl.uoregon.edu</ref>) make available
               images, transcriptions, and English translations of around 100 Nahuatl texts with
               annotations from a variety of archival and published sources. <title rend="italic"
                  >Axolotl</title> (<ref target="https://axolotl-corpus.mx/"
                  >https://axolotl-corpus.mx</ref>) similarly depends on the published and
               unpublished work of established scholars to cross-reference approximately 30
               colonial-era books in Spanish-Nahuatl translation.</p>
            <p>Significant colonial-era Nahuan language documentation also exists from outlying
               regions of the former Aztec empire. Like the Aztecs, the Spanish used central Mexican
               Nahuatl as an imperial <term>lingua franca</term>

               <ptr target="#gasco2017"/>
               <ptr target="#herranz2001"/>. <term>Nahuatlatos</term> — native and non-native
               speakers of Nahuatl who acted as translators and scribes — constituted a crucial link
               in the chain of translation from other Mesoamerican languages to Nahuatl to Spanish
               or Latin and vice versa, making them key actors in diplomacy, Catholic
               evangelization, and the application of Spanish law. Aztec outposts administered by
               central Mexican Nahuatl speakers at the edges of unconquered territory lay the
               groundwork for Nahua-Spanish invasion and colonization of independent regions such as
               Michoacán, Oaxaca, the Yucatán, and Central America <ptr target="#carrasco1999"/>
               <ptr target="#navarrete1996"/>
               <ptr target="#voorhies2004"/>. In the United States in the 1990s, a historical
               methodology called the New Philology began to analyze records of Spanish bureaucracy
               written in Nahuatl not only in central Mexico, but also in regions where it acted as
               a second language of translation <ptr target="#restall1997"/>

               <ptr target="#christensen2013"/>. </p>
            <p>In Central America, Nahuatl's usefulness as a tool of empire was augmented by its
               mutual intelligibility with Nawat and other Eastern Peripheral Nahuan languages
               natively spoken in what today is Chiapas (Mexico), southwestern Guatemala, and El
               Salvador <ptr target="#arauz1960"/>

               Central American documents written in colonial-era Nahuan languages. This is
               partially due to an apparent lack of material. Such appearances, however, are
               deceiving. The largest repositories of colonial-era documents from Central America
               outside of Spain are located in Chiapas and Guatemala, both of which have significant
               Maya populations. Mayan language documents from these regions are therefore highly
               valued, highlighted in archival catalogs, and may even be removed from their original
               context to become standalone documents.<note>For instance, documents of only a few
                  pages each in many different indigenous languages and genres — cofradía documents,
                  letters, tribute records, etc., — are archived together as standalone documents,
                  removed from their original documentary context with no paper trail, within the
                  folder A1 legajo 6074 in the Archivo General de Centro América in Guatemala City.
                  Similarly, see <ref target="#quiroa2017">Quiroa 2017</ref> on the recent decision
                  by the Newberry Library in Chicago to physically separate the <term>Popol

                  place of origin by antiquarian collectors and scholars, with permission or not,
                  represents yet another kind of decontextualization.</note> By contrast, documents
               in Nahuan languages are fragmentary, rarely noted as such, and often remain hidden
               inside bundles of Spanish-language legal papers. Historians of Spanish Guatemala
               typically rely on scribal Spanish translations of Nahuan language text, while Maya
               linguists and language revitalization activists tend to view historical writing in
               Nahuan languages as a colonial-era imposition that has little to offer their project
               of fortifying Mayan languages for future generations and recovering Mayan historical
               and sacred texts. </p>
            <p>In neighboring El Salvador, by contrast, Nawat — the only surviving natively-spoken
               Nahuan language in Central America — is simultaneously valorized as part of the
               national patrimony and discriminated against in everyday life. In 1932, Salvadoran
               state forces massacred tens of thousands of peasants, most of them Nawat speakers, in
               response to an uprising against coffee plantations. Fearful of further repression,
               survivors avoided speaking Nawat in public or teaching it to their children <ptr
                  target="#lindo-fuentes2007"/>
               <ptr target="#gould2008"/>. This generational trauma, combined with deep-seated
               social and economic prejudices against indigeneity and a heavy emphasis on Spanish in
               the education system, has brought Nawat in El Salvador to a critical point of
               endangerment in the twenty-first century. Research on historical Nawat has therefore
               taken a back seat to the urgent task of recording and teaching modern Nawat <ptr
                  target="#lemus2004"/>
               <ptr target="#laramartinez2015"/>. In Nicaragua and Honduras, where Nahuan languages
               are no longer spoken, Nahua heritage is also nationalistically valorized but
               historically hazier and thus far, not well documented <ptr target="#bonta2009"/>

            <p>For all these diverse and contradictory reasons, few Central Americans have studied
               historical documents in Nahuan languages from their own region (although this is
               beginning to change; see <ref target="#romero2017">Romero 2017</ref>, <ref
                  target="#cossich2012">Cossich 2012</ref>). Indeed, it has long been assumed that
               hardly any such documentation existed. The most basic goal of NECA is to correct this
               false impression. Our central claim, however, is not merely that these documents
               exist, but that they are worth studying.</p>
            <p>Linguistically, Central American documents in Nahuan languages bring an entirely new
               data set to debates about the historical evolution of Nahuan languages, especially in
               areas beyond the imperial center. Linguists generally agree on the basic dialectal
               features of two main branches of Nahuatl, Eastern and Western, as well as the urban,
               imperial Nahuatl developed in fifteenth- and sixteenth-century Mexico-Tenochtitlan

                  Madajczak and Hansen 2016, who show that even the characteristics assigned to
                  these generally accepted linguistic labels may be combined or modified and fail to
                  precisely identify the language of any given document.</note> How Nahuan languages
               from Central America fit into these typologies is less settled. <ref
                  target="#campbell1985">Lyle Campbell (1985)</ref> viewed the central Mexican

               local, precolumbian Nahuan vernaculars. NECA makes possible significant advances in
               these linguistic debates, by more than doubling the number of identified sources and
               making high quality images of them accessible online. NECA is also notable for its
               range of dates and genres: catechisms, wills, letters to Spanish officials, town
               council memos, bills of sale, community annals, tributary rolls, judicial testimony
               and denunciations, land titles, musical manuscripts, and confraternity books from the
               mid-sixteenth to the early eighteenth century. Religious texts in Indigenous
               languages are a foundational genre in Mesoamerican studies, and have been analyzed
               for the cadences of Mesoamerican ceremonial speech as well as the intense and
               sometimes antagonistic back-and-forth between European and Indigenous intellectuals

                  Judith Maxwell in the United States.</note> Grammars, vocabularies, catechisms,
               and other Mesoamerican language texts produced by Catholic friars also provide
               valuable linguistic information, sometimes unwittingly. The clerical author of the
               late seventeenth-century Guatemalan sermon <title rend="italic">Teotamachilizti in
                  yiuliliz auh in ymiquiliz Tutemaquizticatzim Iesu Christo</title> now held at the
               John Carter Library at Brown University in the United States, for instance, noted the
               existence of a vehicular or <q>vulgar</q> Nahuatl used alongside Nawat and the
               central Mexican <term>koine </term>in Guatemala. The cleric aspired to write his
               sermon in the <q>vulgar</q> dialect but frequently slipped back into the central
               Mexican variety with which he was more familiar <ptr target="#madajczak2016"/>
               <ptr target="#romero2014a"/>. Bureaucratic documentation generated mostly by
               Indigenous <term>nahuatlatos</term>, conversely, tends to imitate the prestigious
               central Mexican <term>koine</term> and to adopt Spanish legal formulae, but also
               employs less standardized orthography that reflects local speech patterns and the
               decreasing influence over time of the Catholic church on translation norms [von Mentz
               2009, Lockhart 1991, Pizzigoni 2007, Olko and Sullivan 2013]. Historians have used
               such bureaucratic and legal documentation to track political, sociocultural and
               linguistic changes in Mesoamerica as a result of European colonialism, and to uncover
               regional and subregional variations of the language. They have done so by
               systematically assembling, transcribing, translating, cataloguing the characteristics
               of, and comparatively analyzing various corpora of Nahuatl documents. This
               methodology holds great promise for NECA. With transcriptions and translations — to
               date, an aspirational goal — we would be able to create a database of dialectal and
               other linguistic features, locations, genres, scribes' names, year of creation, etc.,
               which would surely yield new insights into the history of Nahuatl's diffusion,
               scribal and ecclesiastical networks, relationship to geography, and other avenues of
               future research. Beyond philology, translations and transcriptions of the documents
               assembled by NECA would enrich the social history of the region. The vast majority of
               lives revealed are of non-native speakers of Nahuan languages: African urbanites,
               Oaxacan plantation workers, Maya choirmasters and cofradía officials, French
               merchants, and innumerous indigenous political leaders: Mam, K'iche', Tzeltal,
               Tojolabal, Jakalteko, Kaqchikel, etc. Contact points between friars, Spanish
               administrators, and local authorities are also plentiful in these documents. Family
               relations simmer underneath accusations of adultery, bigamy, and incest. Inventories
               and wills track the material culture of everyday life and the globalization of
               Mesoamerican commerce. Witchcraft, land and inheritance disputes, and the forced
               labor of women all make an appearance. The input of scholars and community members
               who may not have Nahuan language skills but who bring deep expertise in Mayan and
               Central American history, anthropology, archaeology, geography, and art history is
               crucial for contextualizing such information and incorporating it into larger
                  narratives.<note>A short list might include <ref target="#arroyo2004">Arroyo

            <p>To our assertion of NECA's potential for advancing Nahuan linguistics and Central
               American history, we add the possibility of supporting Nawat revitalization efforts
               in El Salvador. Diverse and overlapping intercultural and intergenerational campaigns
               have been underway in that country since the early 2000s, including a <quote

               access to historical documents written in Indigenous languages has proven valuable in
               other revitalization and decolonization efforts, from the workshop-and-publication
               model in the Polish-Mexican project <title rend="italic">Revitalizing Indigenous
                  Languages</title>
               <ptr target="#olko2014"/> to the <title rend="italic">Ticha</title> digital archive
               of historical Zapotec documents from Oaxaca discussed by Broadwell et al. in this
               special issue (<ref target="https://ticha.haverford.edu/en"
                  >https://ticha.haverford.edu/en</ref>). Preliminary discussions with Salvadorans
               involved in Nawat revitalization indicate that while there may be a place for NECA in
               the future, for now the urgency of recording and promoting modern Nawat overshadows
               interest in historical documents. How NECA might contribute to Nawat revitalization
               is uncertain, in part, because the linguistic identification of so many of our
               documents remains unclear and the majority are from Guatemala, where Nawat was
               historically spoken but is no longer. Again, further study via transcriptions and
               translations is needed in order to clarify how the NECA corpus may speak to the case
               of Salvadoran Nawat. In the meantime, we hope that NECA's expression of international
               scholarly interest in Central American Nahuan languages, free access to downloadable,
               high-quality images of colonial-era documents for anyone with an internet connection,
               and public witness to the long history of Nawat in El Salvador stands as a one more

            <head>The Form: Going Digital</head>
            <p>NECA began with a list of over 40 documents compiled by Sergio Romero (University of
               Texas at Austin) and Laura Matthew (Marquette University), in collaboration with a
               dozen other colleagues, for an encyclopedia project that never materialized. As
               Romero and Matthew sought alternate ways to publish the list, new items continued to
               surface. It became clear that given the number of Nahuan language documents that go
               unrecorded in archive catalogs and the extent to which scholars tend to run across
               them unexpectedly, the list could easily grow longer and a traditional print
               publication would quickly become outdated. Simply posting the list online might
               stimulate interest, but the need to travel to physical archives represented a
               significant barrier to serious engagement since those with the most capacity to read
               early modern manuscripts in Nahuan languages tend not to live or work in Guatemala
               and Chiapas, where the main repositories of NECA's documents are located. Working
               with programmer Michael Bannister, and with permission from the original
               repositories, Matthew decided in 2015 to create a digital archive of high-quality
               images using Omeka, the popular open-source content management system for digital
               collections from the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media (CHNM) at George
               Mason University. For the remainder of this essay, <q>we</q> refers to Matthew and
               Bannister as the sole creators and curators of NECA. Our first curatorial decision
               was conceptual: to restrict the archive's geographical range to Central America as
               defined by colonial-era administrative boundaries. This meant including documents
               from Chiapas but not from neighboring and similarly multilingual places like Oaxaca,
               where Nahuatl also functioned as a vehicular <term>lingua franca</term>
               <ptr target="#terraciano2001"/>
               <ptr target="#swanton2008"/>. Segregating Oaxaca from Central America seemed in some
               ways artificial and over-determined by the same national, academic, and disciplinary
               boundaries NECA aspires to overcome. But such boundaries are both real and
               significant. At a practical level, we accumulated items from Chiapas but not Oaxaca
               by default, because Chiapas’s colonial records were sent to the judicial Audiencia of
               Guatemala while Oaxaca's were sent to Mexico. Linguistically speaking, a Central
               American focus also directed attention to the contact points between Mayan and Nahuan
               languages. We did not want the Central American material to be prematurely absorbed
               into the considerably more developed academic literature on Nahuatl in Oaxaca and
               elsewhere in Mexico, without a proper understanding of the local contexts that
               produced it. We also took seriously Justyna Olko's and John Sullivan's assertion that
                  <quote rend="inline">more research on this topic [of local and regional
                  differences and their relation to standardization] is greatly needed; especially

                  and lower-ranking scribes/authors within a given locality</quote>
               <ptr target="#olko2013" loc="192"/>. A distinctly Central American corpus creates the
               possibility of comparative study with data sets from other multilingual, borderland,
               and outlying regions where Nahuatl was and is spoken, such as Oaxaca, Jalisco,
               Veracruz, and Guerrero <ptr target="#canger2017"/>
               <ptr target="#olko2014"/>
               <ptr target="#guion2010"/>
               <ptr target="#yanezrosales2017"/>. Finally, by drawing a line around Central America
               we hoped to direct attention towards and raise awareness of the ongoing, severely
               underfunded, but multi-pronged efforts to revitalize Nawat in El Salvador. As we
               began to build the site, created and solicited feedback from an advisory board, and
               presented at conferences in the United States, Guatemala, and El Salvador,
               overlapping and mismatched interests in the NECA corpus became increasingly apparent.
               Historians, anthropologists, and archaeologists working in Central America were
               enthusiastic about sharing their archival references and interested in the
               information the documents contained, which they often could not read. Linguists and
               philologists working primarily in Mexico were interested in the dialectal features of
               the documents but were unfamiliar with their Central American context and history.
               Scholars and activists working on Nahuan languages in Central America expressed
               interest but lacked the financial and human resources to engage NECA without
               diverting valuable attention from existing projects, especially those supporting
               revitalization of Nawat in El Salvador. We began to think about how NECA’s structure
               could more actively facilitate communication across these disciplinary, regional, and
               national borders. Unlocking the information inside the documents would be the
               essential first step for any kind of macro-analysis of the entire corpus,
               computational or otherwise, and for connecting scholars with similar interests and
               complementary skills. Could we help scholars find not just the documents, but each
               other? Could we create an online workspace that encouraged scholars to share their
               expertise and begin to generate data for comparative and collaborative analysis?

                  target="https://diyhistory.lib.uiowa.edu/"
               >https://diyhistory.lib.uiowa.edu</ref>), we added the transcription plugin Scripto,
               and created an <q>Add a Document</q> feature using a Simple Contact Form plugin to
               encourage contributions of new documents. A separate, linked Wordpress site (<ref
                  target="https://nahuatlnawat.wordpress.com/"
                  >https://nahuatlnawat.wordpress.com</ref>) became the project blog and discussion
               space. The backbone of Omeka is the items list, supported by Dublin Core-based
               metadata. Most metadata elements are obvious: date, title, source, etc. Nevertheless,
               each element reflects a curatorial decision made by us with certain goals in mind. We
               added new metadata elements for the number of <q>folios</q> to emphasize the variety
               and extent of the corpus, and for at-a-glance decisions by users about whether or not
               to transcribe; <q>sample text</q> to spark the potential transcriber's and/or
               translator's interest; <q>location</q> with the modern countries, states, and/or
               departments in addition to the colonial-era information to allow for sub-regional
               searches and future experiments in mapping; <q>date of creation</q> of the item
               itself to keep a record of the corpus's growth; and the <q>contributor</q> of the
               document in order to acknowledge her or his research and participation. Metadata
               omissions also reveal the synergy between form, content, and curation. A primary goal
               of NECA is to encourage the linguistic study of a larger corpus of Nahuan documents
               from Central America than usual, and eventually to gather the results in a database
               of linguistic features for comparative analysis. Some of our documents conform to a
               single, clear Nahuan variant. Most, however, present a mix of attributes, as one
               might expect of writing produced by non-native speakers in a context of ongoing (or
               decreasing) standardization, colonial power dynamics, and the adoption by indigenous
               people of foreign writing technologies. This linguistic heterogeneity makes the NECA
               corpus an exceedingly valuable resource for exploring the history of Nahuan languages
               at linguistic borderlands <ptr target="#madajczak2016" loc="239"/>. We chose not to
               create a metadata element that prematurely assigned the documents a reductive
               linguistic label until we have more data through transcription and analysis. We also
               wanted to avoid a situation in which non-linguists might interpret such labels as
               more definitive than they really are. Decisions about the items themselves
               predetermine what researchers can and cannot do with them. Most of NECA's items are
               fragments within larger documents — sometimes, much larger. On a mostly non-existent
               budget, we faced issues of server space, labor, and funding: photographers require
               payment, repositories may charge publication fees. Additionally, in this first
               iteration of the project we were focused on access and translation. We therefore
               chose to publish only the Nahuatl portions of any given document, for both practical
               reasons and in order to attract Nahuatl translators. This decision has consequences.
               For better or worse, it denies the user access to any Spanish translation that might
               have appeared in the original document. It also separates the fragment from its
               larger documentary context, digitally replicating the same de-contextualization that
               has been suffered by many Mayan-language documents. A fuller understanding of the
               document's creation and information can only be achieved by consulting the original
               document in relation to its archival context. Data sets of people, places, and other
               kinds of information contained in the digital archive — for instance, paying
               attention to geographical location or scribal networks — will also remain incomplete
               without access to the full original. Researchers will have to return to the physical
               archives in order to get the whole picture, and we run the danger that they will not
                  <ptr target="#putnam2016"/>. Finally, anticipating the user experience led to some
               programming alterations. Omeka's automatically generated citations omitted the
               original archive; we changed the code to cite the document's physical repository and
               archival signature first, followed by NECA and the date of access. To guide users
               towards specific activities, we turned Omeka's <q>featured items</q> into a <q>sample
                  transcription</q> and <q>featured collections</q> into <q>document teams.</q>
               Omeka's built-in internationalization combined with the plugin Locale Switcher made
               the site bilingual, allowing users to choose in real time whether to view the site in
               Spanish or English. Because we had significantly altered the standard Omeka framework
               with new navigation headings, metadata categories, etc., Spanish versions had to be
               added to the internationalization code, as did all Spanish translations of all the
               text within the transcription tool Scripto. However, these changes affected only the
               user interface, not the items' metadata. Assuming that most of our users would be
               competent in Spanish but not necessarily in English, we decided to make Spanish the
               primary language of the site (and in doing so, officially baptized it as NECA: in
               Spanish, <title rend="italic">El Náhuatl/náhuat en Centroamérica</title>). All
               metadata is in Spanish regardless of the interface language, and simple pages
               unaffected by the plugin privilege Spanish at the top with anchors to an English
               translation below.<note>CHNS has since released a new version Omeka S with a built-in
                  multilingual option, but as of this writing it is not compatible with Scripto.

            <p>At every structural opportunity we emphasized the collaborative, open nature of the
               project and minimized our own gatekeeping. Conversations during beta testing between
               anthropologist Janine Gasco and historians Julia Madajczak and Agnieszka Brylak
               inspired us to create mechanisms for interdisciplinary document teams to work on
               single items. Contributors of new citations are individually added to the <q>About
                  Us</q> page as well as to their items' metadata. Transcribers and translators are
               encouraged to register for Scripto with their full name so they can be properly
               identified in the versioning of transcriptions and translations and credited in
               future publications, as we require under our Creative Commons Attribution-Non
               Commercial 3.0 U.S. license. NECA is not a crowdsourcing project, but it does invite
               researchers to share their documents, modern <term>nahuatlatos</term> to share their
               translations, and academics and community members to share their ideas
               transnationally and interdisciplinarily. Through its design, the website attempts to
               make the case that this is worth everyone's while.</p>

            <head>The Form of the Content: If We Build It, Will They Come?</head>
            <p>Archival research and the transcription and translation of idiosyncratic documents
               written in difficult handwriting, often in foreign languages, requires patience,
               time, resources, and above all, advanced skills that accrue over the years. Doctoral
               degrees, job offers, tenure, and future funding depend on demonstrating the fruits of
               this individual labor. There is nothing wrong with claiming the privacy to work, and
               what we have labeled <q>document teams</q> in NECA can also form via email,
               conferences, special journal issues, and edited volumes. If NECA's first iteration –
               the digital archive – produces a flurry of new publications and dissertations created
               outside our platform, this will be a positive result. NECA nevertheless encourages
               scholars to go beyond individual documents and to work beyond their comfort zones. It
               identifies common research interests across disciplines and national and academic
               communities, and presents the opportunity to share citations, translations, and
               knowledge in a public forum; to compare notes online; and eventually, given
               transcriptions and translations, to create databases, analyze the corpus as a whole,
               and experiment with different digital and computational tools. The NECA corpus is
               large and geographically varied enough to reveal not only the dialectal features of
               Nahuan languages in Central America, but also the documents’ production related to
               colonial settlement, ecclesiastical influence, social and political networks, the
               economy, and geography. We see great future value, especially, in thinking through
               NECA’s data using spatial analysis and mapping tools. Bringing linguists and
               translators of Nahuatl together with non-<term>nahuatlato</term> scholars of Central
               America has the potential to advance all this research further, faster. We built NECA
               to nudge people in this collaborative direction. The question is, will they come? So
               far, the answer is yes and no. NECA's analytics from Reclaim Hosting show that since
               the digital archive went online in July 2016, it has received the most intensive and
               consistent use (measured by bandwidth used, the ratio of pages to hits, and annual
               location data) from Mexico, El Salvador, and Guatemala, as well as Spain, Germany,
               Poland, and France in Europe — the last three being major centers of Mesoamerican and
               Nahuatl studies — and the United States, Brazil, and Canada in the Americas.
               Presentations at the University of Texas at Austin in March 2017, the Congreso de
               Estudios Mayas in Guatemala City in July 2017, the Asociación Centroamericana de
               Lingüística annual meeting in San Salvador in August 2017, the American Historical
               Association annual meeting in January 2018, and the Sociedad Mexicana de
               Historiografía Lingüística in Mexico City in October 2018, each produced temporary
               bumps in the number of unique visitors and/or intensity of use, which then tapered
               off. The Austin presentation acted as an official launch of the project with the
               power of social media behind it, resulting in an eighteen-fold increase in unique
               visitors immediately afterwards (March-April 2017). Subsequent presentations in
               Guatemala and El Salvador produced the most remarkable user data in the site's
               history thus far. In the two months following (July-August 2017) — and with no
               official social media push — the number of unique visitors to the site quadrupled.
               More importantly, the bandwidth and pages-to-hits ratio indicated significantly more
               searching through the site's most complex pages, such as those containing document
               images, than after the Austin presentation. The Central Americans' more intensive use
               is visible in the contrast between their relatively low number of unique visitors
               (yellow) relative to pages, hits, and bandwidth (blue and green).</p>

            <p>From 2016 through 2018, the United States and Ukraine generated most of the site’s
               hundreds of thousands of page views, 75% of which lasted thirty seconds or less.
               Presumably, a large portion of these were bots. The next largest proportions of
               visits, however, lasted for over one hour (around 8%), thirty minutes to an hour
               (around 6%), and fifteen to thirty minutes (around 4%), suggesting that a significant
               minority of users were seriously engaging the site. Notably, when we ceased to
               actively promote the site in 2019 we saw a drop in unique visitors, a consistent
               narrowing of the pages-to-hits ratio indicating shallower exploration of the site,
               and 88% of visits lasting less than thirty seconds. (For the first time, a large
               number of such visits in 2019 came from the Netherlands, bumping Ukraine to third
               place in the <q>probably a bot</q> category). Nevertheless, in 2019 the most
               intensive users — those spending thirty minutes to over an hour on the site at a time
               — still constituted our next largest user group, or 7% of the total number of visits.
               As a digital archive, therefore, NECA is doing reasonably well even when we do not
               take advantage of conferences, social media, and other means to publicize and promote
               it. As an online platform for collaborative transcription, it has been less
               successful. A few people have used the <q>Add a Document</q> feature to provide new
               citations and high-quality images, but most of the 19 new documents added since the
               site’s inception have come from our own research or direct outreach. The same is true
               of the Discussion area, where invited essays by Janine Gasco on Nahuan agricultural
               terms in the Soconusco and by Adriana Álvarez on Nahuatl instruction at the
               Universidad de San Carlos in Guatemala have generated a handful of comments from
               community members mostly from El Salvador or of Salvadoran descent in the United
               States, but no serious scholarly engagement, without which we cannot move forward to
               better understand why, how, or to whom these documents might be important. The
               document teams and Scripto's transcription tool have attracted no users at all since
               beta testing in March 2017. This may be a design issue. This first iteration of NECA
               is based on a pre-designed Omeka platform and utilizes only the Scripto features made
               available through the plug-in. Certainly we could improve the transcription and
               translation tool to be more appealing and effective, including a simpler user
               interface, better versioning, an improved commenting feature that identifies the user
               and is always visible, side-by-side images and workspace, progress bars, and the
               ability to toggle between transcriptions, translations, and versioning on a single
               page. The features and functionality of the transcription tool at the <title
                  rend="italic">Codex Aubin</title> project, hosted on software developer Ben
               Brumfield's transcription platform FromThePage based on Ruby on Rails (<ref
                  target="https://fromthepage.com/">https://fromthepage.com</ref>), are exemplary
                  (<ref target="https://fromthepage.ace.fordham.edu/benwbrum/codex-aubin"
                  >https://fromthepage.ace.fordham.edu/benwbrum/codex-aubin</ref>), as is the
               transcription and search tool created for the <title rend="italic">Freedom on the
                  Move </title>project (<ref target="https://freedomonthemove.org/index.html"
                  >https://freedomonthemove.org/index.html</ref>). Other projects with more
               user-friendly transcription workspaces than NECA include the Newberry Library's
                  <title rend="italic">Newberry Transcribes</title> (<ref
                  target="https://publications.newberry.org/digital/mms-transcribe/index"
                  >https://publications.newberry.org/digital/mms-transcribe/index</ref>) and
               Maynooth University's <title rend="italic">Letters 1916-1923</title> (<ref
                  target="http://letters1916.maynoothuniversity.ie/learn"
                  >http://letters1916.maynoothuniversity.ie/learn</ref>), both of which are based on
               Omeka and Scripto. How the digital archive's form can encourage engagement with its
               content is not, however, only a design issue. The most successful transcription
               projects come from outward-facing institutions digitizing items from their physical
               archives and making them available to <q>citizen humanists</q> with the clear goal of
               public engagement — for instance (among many other examples), the Smithsonian
               Institution's <title rend="italic">Digital Volunteers </title>initiative (<ref
                  target="https://transcription.si.edu/">https://transcription.si.edu</ref>) and the
               Library of Virginia's <title rend="italic">Making History</title> project (<ref
                  target="http://www.virginiamemory.com/transcribe"
                  >http://www.virginiamemory.com/transcribe</ref>). Often, featured collections are
               chosen with audience interest and capabilities in mind. The Stanford University
               Archives (<ref target="https://library.stanford.edu/spc/university-archives"
                  >https://library.stanford.edu/spc/university-archives</ref>), for example, invites
               online transcription of manuscripts related to the university's history, in English.
               Broad or targeted appeal of the subject matter, readability of the documents, and
               language accessibility seem equally relevant to the success of the aforementioned
                  <title rend="italic">Freedom on the Move Project</title>, which crowdsources
               transcriptions of mostly English, printed newspaper announcements of rewards for
               runaway African-American slaves; <title rend="italic">Newberry Transcribes</title>,
               which presents mostly English-language diaries and letters about family life in the
               Midwest; and the narrower but commemorative <title rend="italic">Letters
                  1916-1923</title>, which invites visitors to submit and transcribe their own
               family's documents for upcoming anniversaries of the Easter Rising, World War I, and
               the Irish War of Independence and Civil War. A search through the transcription
               platform FromThePage's various collections suggests that more academic projects often
               involve fewer participants, especially where handwritten manuscripts from earlier
               time periods with idiosyncratic paleography in languages other than English are
               concerned. Online transcription in these circumstances seems to work best as a
               collaboration tool between professors and students, or between small groups of
               colleagues with similar skills. This is the case of the <title rend="italic">Codex
                  Aubin</title> and <title rend="italic">French from Outremer</title> (<ref
                  target="https://fromthepage.ace.fordham.edu/collection/show?collection_id=1"
                  >https://fromthepage.ace.fordham.edu/collection/show?collection_id=1</ref>)
               projects from Fordham University, which deal with medieval and early modern
               manscripts in Nahuatl and French requiring highly specialized transcribers. Many
               digital archives of similarly challenging material rely entirely on professional
               teams and do not make collaborative online transcription tools available, for
               instance the <title rend="italic">BFM - Base de Français Médiéval</title> (<ref
                  target="http://txm.bfm-corpus.org/">txm.bfm-corpus.org</ref>), the <title
                  rend="italic">1641 Depositions Project</title> from Trinity College, Ireland (<ref
                  target="http://1641.tcd.ie/project.php">http://1641.tcd.ie/project.php</ref>), and
               the <title rend="italic">Native Northeast Research Collaborative</title> (<ref
                  target="https://www.thenativenortheast.org/"
                  >https://www.thenativenortheast.org</ref>). Comparing these projects, and NECA, to
               the <title rend="italic">Ticha</title> project described in this issue by Broadwell
               et al. makes clear that the challenges faced by creators of digital archives are
               highly contingent. As a digital archive and online transcription platform for
               colonial-era texts in Zapotec languages from Oaxaca, <title rend="italic"
                  >Ticha</title> encountered some of the same design limitations as NECA when using
               software such as Scripto and the Fieldworks Language Explorer (FLEx) <ptr
                  target="#broadwell2020"/>
               <ptr target="#broadwell2013"/>. <title rend="italic">Ticha</title> was aided by the
               fact that the interests of Zapotec speakers and scholars, ethnohistorians, and
               linguists converged on the same region and language, as opposed to the criss-crossing
               and sometimes conflicting interests faced by NECA. However, <title rend="italic"
                  >Ticha</title> is also a powerful example of what sustained attention to the human
               side of digital projects — conferences and workshops, acceptance and accommodation of
               a wide range of user communities, and outreach especially to non-academic
               stakeholders, in this case native speakers of Indigenous and minority languages — can
               achieve. To re-design the weakest link of NECA, its transcription tool, would require
               at minimum a switch from the current pre-designed website and/or outsourcing of the
               tool, and possibly changing from WikiMedia to a standalone database. It is not clear
               that, at this stage of the project, the effort would be worth it. While some have
               expressed interest in using the site as a teaching tool for advanced students who are
               simultaneously learning Nahuatl and paleography, there is no way to know whether this
               is happening. Likewise, if more established scholars are working with documents from
               NECA, they are doing outside the context of the site. At a practical level, scholars
               may find online transcription and translation, which requires working within the
               confines of the program and/or between multiple formats, less efficient than
               traditional methods. They may also appreciate opportunities for face-to-face
               discussion prior to performing their work online. Scholarship is risky and takes
               time. Sturdy, creative collaborations between people who have not traditionally
               worked together — such as the local, national, disciplinary, and academic networks
               that have expressed interest in NECA yet remain siloed from each other — may
               initially develop better in person. Rather than immediately overhauling the site or
               the transcription tool, a better next step for NECA may be more old-fashioned: to
               convene scholars and community members in different combinations and venues, with the
               goal of creating collaborative teams and identifying viable research questions and
               interests in common. Digital humanities promises more than a new marriage between
               mathematical, qualitative, and design methodologies and tools. It also proposes a
               paradigmatic change in how scholars collaborate, flattening research and/or learning
               communities and vaunting an idealized, non-hierarchical community where people
               willingly share their research, promote interdisciplinarity, and work in teams of
               members with complementary skills sets, none of which is seen as more important than
               another. Despite the ways in which this mimics Silicon Valley-ese (rightly criticized
               for its hypocrisy), there is much to hold onto here: the potential of digital
               humanities to communicate with broader publics, to democratize the production of
               knowledge, to make the fruits of scholarship more accessible, and to make us all more
               flexible thinkers. As NECA argues, digital archives also have the potential to push
               scholarship in certain directions by calling attention to understudied texts or
               problematics and by making the materials for studying them available. But the digital
               humanities’ optimistic, even utopian view of the scholarly workplace is tinged with
               disciplinary, financial, and intergenerational anxieties. In the United States,
               humanities scholars of all stripes fear the devaluation of their work in the
               information age. The younger generation faces an increasingly freelance economy and
               shrinking humanities job market from the peculiar position of being simultaneously
               valued for their digital savvy (writing code, understanding algorithms, managing
               project teams, marketing their work), expected to be innovators and
               jacks-of-all-trades, and suspected of not doing the kinds of specialized research
               that got their professorly elders tenure. Established scholars are suspected of
               lagging behind the digital turn, but have more freedom to experiment with digital
               tools — or not — with far less risk to their future careers. They are also the
               gatekeepers of the academy. It is therefore incumbent upon senior scholars,
               especially, to ponder the lessons of creative failure in digital humanities projects.
               NECA shows the potential for digital archiving to turn a wide range of people's
               attention towards a particular corpus of historical documentation and set of
               questions. NECA also highlights the difficulty of attracting scholars to
               skills-intensive transcription and translation online in collaborative projects
               without prior commitments, goals, and relationships in common. While we maintain the
               first iteration of the NECA digital archive, our next best step for transcription and
               translation — the necessary building blocks of any future database — will involve
               human, not digital, development: recruiting and funding new team members, acquiring
               grant money to pay for skilled transcriptions and translations, and organizing
               conferences. With data in hand and new ideas on the table, we can start to
               contemplate smaller, more limited digital tools — what Rockwell and Sinclair [2016]
               call "embeddable toys" – for scholars to play with, exploring what value computation
               might bring to the analysis of the entire NECA corpus. To move forward we must
               forcefully argue for the funding of <emph>both</emph> methods of scholarship, digital
               and traditional, most especially for those who will be the generators, guardians, and
               teachers of Nahuatl and Nawat in the future.</p>
