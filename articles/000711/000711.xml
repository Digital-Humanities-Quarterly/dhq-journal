            <p>Annotating – understood here as the process in which segments of a text are marked as
               belonging to a defined category <ptr target="#reiter_willand_gius2020"/> – can be
               seen as a key technique in many disciplines <ptr target="#macmullen2005"/>,
               especially for working with text in the Humanities [e.g. Unsworth 2000], the
               Computational Sciences (e.g. <ptr target="#sivasothyetal2021"/>; <ptr
                  target="#doleschaletal2022"/>), and the Digital Humanities <ptr
                  target="#caria_mathiak2019"/>. In the field of Digital Humanities, annotations of
               text are utilized, among other purposes, for the enrichment of a corpus or digital
               edition with (linguistic) information (e.g. <ptr target="#lu2014"/>; <ptr
                  target="#nantke_schlupkothen2020"/>), for close and distant reading methods (e.g.
                  <ptr target="#jaenickeetal2015"/>), or for machine learning techniques (e.g. <ptr
                  target="#fioruccietal2020"/>). Defining categories to shape data has been used in
               different text analysis contexts, including the study of toponyms (e.g. <ptr
                  target="#kyriacopoulou2019"/>) and biographical data (e.g. <ptr
                  target="#aprosio_tonelli2015"/>).</p>
            <p>The paper at hand showcases the use of annotations within the Vienna Time Machine
               project (2020-2022, PI: Claudia Resch) which aims to connect different knowledge
               resources about historical Vienna via Named Entity Recognition (NER). More
               specifically, it discusses the challenges and potentials of annotating 18th century
               death lists found in the <title rend="italic">Wien[n]erisches Diarium</title> or
                  <title rend="italic">Wiener Zeitung</title>, an early modern newspaper which was
               first published in 1703 and has already been (partly) digitized in form of the
               so-called DIGITARIUM <ptr target="#resch_kampkaspar2019"/>: Here, users can access
               over 330 high-quality full text issues of the newspaper which contain a number of
               different text types, including articles, advertisements and more structured texts,
               such as arrival or death lists. The focus of this article lies on the semi-structured
               death lists, which do not only appear in almost every issue of the historical <title
                  rend="italic">Wiener Zeitung</title>, but are also relatively consistent in their
               structure and display a high semantic density: Each entry contains detailed
               information about a deceased person, such as their name, occupation, place of death,
               and age.</p>
            <p>Annotating these semi-structured list items opens up multiple possibilities: The
               resulting classified data can be used for efficient distant or scalable reading,
               quantitative analyses <ptr target="#nanni_kuemper_ponzetto2016"/>, and as a gold
               standard for both rule-based and machine learning NER approaches (e.g. <ptr
                  target="#jiang_banchs_li2016"/>). To reach this goal and as a first step of the
               annotation process, the project team conducted a close reading of various death lists
               from multiple decades to identify recurrent linguistic patterns and, based hereon, to
               develop a first expandable set of categories. This bottom-up approach resulted in
               five preliminary categories, namely PERSON, OCCUPATION, PLACE, AGE and
               CAUSE-OF-DEATH, which were color-coded <ptr target="#jaenickeetal2015"/> and,
               accompanied by annotated examples, documented in the form of annotation guidelines as
               intersubjectively applicable and concise as possible. These guidelines were then used
               by two researchers familiar with the historic material to annotate a randomly drawn
               and temporally distributed sample of 500 death list entries in the browser-based
               environment Prodigy (<ref target="https://prodi.gy">https://prodi.gy</ref>). Hereby,
               the emphasis was put especially on emerging <q>challenging</q> cases, i.e. items
               where annotators were in doubt about their choice of category, the exact positioning
               of annotations or the necessity to annotate certain text segments at all. Whenever
               annotators encountered such ambiguous items, these were collected, grouped and – as a
               third step in the annotation process – discussed with an interdisciplinary group of
               linguists, historians and prosopographers. Within this collective, a solution for
               each group of issues was agreed on and incorporated into the annotation guidelines.
               Also, existing categories were revised where necessary. The new, more stable category
               system was then again used for a new sequence of annotation and discussion of
               ambiguities, resulting in an iterative process where annotation and category
               development became intertwined. This approach, explained in the article in more
               detail, demonstrates that tagsets are never entirely final, but always depend on
               particular knowledge interests and data material and that even the annotation of
               inherently semi-structured lists requires continuous critical reflection and
               considerable historical and linguistic knowledge.</p>
            <p>At the same time, it can be exemplified by this work that it is precisely these
                  <q>challenging</q> cases which carry a great potential for gaining knowledge and
               can be considered central to the development of a valid annotation system (cf. <ptr
                  target="#franken_koch_zinsmeister2020"/>).</p>

            <p>Digital processes and research practices have given new relevance to the formation of
               categories for textual analysis, as evidenced by the presence and complexity of the
               term <term>annotation</term>. The annotation of data can be seen as a key technique
               in many disciplines <ptr target="#macmullen2005"/>, especially for working with text
               in the Humanities (e.g. Unsworth, 2000), the Computational Sciences (e.g. <ptr
                  target="#sivasothyetal2021"/>; <ptr target="#doleschaletal2022"/>) and
               subsequently, the Digital Humanities <ptr target="#caria_mathiak2019"/>. Rehm <ptr
                  target="#rehm2020" loc="p. 299"/> also reaffirms this, stating that the <quote
                  rend="inline">annotation of textual information is one of the most fundamental
                  activities in Linguistics and Computational Linguistics including neighbouring
                  fields such as, among others, Literary Studies, Library Science and Digital
                  Humanities</quote>. </p>
            <p>In the broad field of Digital Humanities, annotations of text are used in
               multifaceted ways, as they pose a crucial methodological step for the further
               analytical processing of text sources within different analytical procedures <ptr
                  target="#franken_koch_zinsmeister2020"/>. For example, they allow for the
               enrichment of a corpus or digital edition with (linguistic) information (e.g. <ptr
                  target="#lu2014"/>; <ptr target="#nantke_schlupkothen2020"/>), for the use of
               close and distant reading methods (e.g. <ptr target="#jaenickeetal2015"/>), or for
               machine learning techniques (e.g. <ptr target="#fioruccietal2020"/>). </p>
            <p>Annotation can broadly be defined as the <quote rend="inline">addition of metadata,
                  comments, markup, or other information that supplements the original data and

               application of annotations, making them a valuable contribution for digital textual
               scholarship. However, there is a variety of different obstacles and hurdles to

               during the 18th century, it held the undisputed position of being the most important
               newspaper within the Habsburg Monarchy. The <title rend="italic">Diarium</title> was
               published twice a week in its first century, was printed in quarto format and
               contained between 8 and 40 pages, with a considerable increase in volume towards the
               end of the century. The fact that the entire collection as an intact body of issues

            <p>The historical <title rend="italic">Wiener Zeitung</title> contains a number of
               different text types, including articles, official announcements and advertisements,
               but also more structured texts, such as arrival or death lists. The focus of this
               article lies on the semi-structured death lists, which do not only appear in almost
               every issue of the newspaper, but are also relatively consistent in their structure
               and display a high semantic density: sorted by date of death and frequently also by
               location (inside vs. outside the city), the persons who died in Vienna since the last
               issue of the newspaper are listed.</p>

            <p>Within the <title rend="italic">DIGITARIUM</title>, each newspaper issue of the
                  <title rend="italic">Diarium</title> was edited using the TEI/P5 guidelines. This
               includes the TEI header and several other elements, as for example divisions
               (&lt;div&gt;), paragraphs (&lt;p&gt;), words (&lt;w&gt;) and highlighted text, to
               distinguish passages or words printed in Antiqua font from its surroundings
               (&lt;hi&gt;). For the structural annotation of lists, the &lt;list&gt; element was
               used to encode any sequence of items organized as a list. Each distinct item in the
               list was then encoded as a distinct &lt;item&gt; element (see TEI Guidelines, Section
               3.8). Additionally, (sub-)headings which, in case of the death lists, were used to
               group list entries according to time and/or space were encoded through the
               &lt;head&gt;-element:</p>

            </figure>
            <p>Each of these entries or &lt;item&gt;-elements contains detailed information about a
               specific deceased person, for instance their name, occupation, place of death, and
               age. Generally speaking, the process of annotating such entities can be analogue or
               digital, whereas the latter can again be subdivided in manual, semi-automatic and
               fully automatic practices. While analogue annotations serve to organize, structure,
               acquire and pass on knowledge, the digital paradigm exceeds these functions, e.g.
               allowing for the observation of patterns, further processing of the annotations, as
               well as the usage of large amounts of data <ptr target="#rapp2017" loc="pp. 254–255"
               />. At the same time, especially when processing larger (historical) amounts of data,
               it is of central importance that the category formation and annotation process is
               well-regulated and adheres to clear guidelines. In the special case of death lists in
               historical newspapers such guidelines as well as a category system itself are first
               to be developed, as such texts have so far only been considered for individual
               studies focusing on selected aspects and/or time spans where no systematic annotation
               of the material was carried out (e.g. <ptr target="#peller1920"/>).</p>

               close reading of various death lists from multiple decades to identify recurrent
               linguistic patterns and, based hereon, to develop a first expandable set of
               categories. This bottom-up approach resulted in five preliminary categories, namely
               PERSON, OCCUPATION, PLACE, CAUSE-OF-DEATH and AGE, as annotated in the exemplary item
               below:</p>

            <p>The categories derived from the text were color-coded (cf. legend above; <ptr
                  target="#jaenickeetal2015"/>) and, in combination with annotated examples,
               documented in the form of annotation guidelines as intersubjectively applicable and
               concise as possible. These guidelines were then used as concrete aids for
               decision-making by two researchers familiar with the historic material to annotate a
               randomly drawn and temporally distributed sample of 500 death list entries in the
               browser-based environment Prodigy (<ref target="https://prodi.gy/"
                  >https://prodi.gy</ref>). The software provides annotators with a graphic user
               interface, where they are shown one item at a time accompanied by the pre-defined
               tagset:</p>
            <figure>

               <graphic url="resources/images/figure03.png"/>
            </figure>
            <p>Annotations are made by first choosing a tag through clicking on it and then marking
               one or multiple words to which the tag should be assigned. In case of errors or
               re-decisions, markings can be easily deleted and redone. Furthermore, Prodigy allows
               for unclear items to be omitted and for multiple users to (re-)annotate the same
               dataset.</p>
            <p>During this annotation process, the emphasis was put especially on emerging
                  <q>challenging</q> cases, i.e. items where annotators were in doubt about their
               choice of category, the exact positioning of annotations or the necessity to annotate
               certain text segments at all. Whenever annotators encountered such ambiguous items,
               these were collected, grouped and – as a third step in the annotation process –
               discussed within the interdisciplinary team of philologists, historians and
               prosopographers. Within this collective, a solution for each group of issues was
               agreed on and incorporated into the annotation guidelines. As a consequence, existing
               categories were revised where necessary. The new, more stable and mature category
               system was then again used for a new sequence of annotation and discussion of
               ambiguities, resulting in an iterative process where annotation and category
               development became intertwined. This approach roughly corresponds to Rapp’s <ptr
                  target="#rapp2017" loc="pp. 256–257"/> basic notion of an annotation process,
               which she breaks down into the following five steps: it involves an initial
               exploratory data analysis, an initial definition of categories and formulation of
               guidelines, the annotation itself, an evaluation, and the repetition of these steps.
               Concrete findings that emerged through this process are discussed in the following
               sections on the basis of sample items. </p>
            <div>
               <head>PERSON</head>
               <p>Since each death list item documents one person that died in- or outside the city
                  of Vienna, the tag PERSON can be considered fundamental for the annotation task.
                  It refers to information identifying the individual whose death is detailed,
                  specifically, their first and/or last name, as given in (2): </p>
               <list type="simple">

               </list>
               <p>However, not every death list entry follows the prototypical pattern of [first
                  name] + [last name] given in (2) which provides annotators with a clear conception
                  of where the PERSON tag should start and end. Instead, items can also, among other
                  things, involve maternal names (cf. 3), additional titles (cf. 4), and even
                  unnamed persons (cf. 5). In order to facilitate later disambiguation and to
                  distinguish items with unknown persons from items missing an annotation tag, we
                  decided to also subsume such (as well as similar) cases of additional identity
                  information under the PERSON tag:</p>

               <p>However, not all issues encountered when annotating could be solved solely by
                  widening (or narrowing) the scope of the PERSON category. For instance, as example

               <p>Due to such cases as well as the high frequency of items involving more than one
                  person, an adjustment of the initial tagset was deemed necessary: instead of
                  assigning the overarching tag PERSON to all (un-)named persons, the category was
                  split into two separate tags, namely PERSON-DECEASED and PERSON-RELATED. Although
                  this conceptualisation is currently sufficient for our research interests, further
                  sub-categories are certainly possible. For instance, depending on the respective
                  purpose, one could additionally distinguish between first, second and last name,
                  or between maternal and married name. </p>

               <p>Another type of personal information included in (almost) all death list entries
                  is occupational information. Here, in contrast to the previous category, no
                  additional distinction between the occupation of a deceased person and the
                  occupation of a relative/spouse needs to be made since given occupation titles
                  generally refer to male persons:<note> In very rare cases, an occupation is also
                     attributed to women, but in this case no male person is part of the respective

                        Fleisch=hacker</foreign></hi>
                  <q>civic butcher</q>) is mentioned by name. The same principle applies to death
                  list entries for married women and partly even widows (e.g. <hi rend="italic"
                        ><foreign xml:lang="de">Glasermeist. Witw.</foreign></hi>
                  <q>master glazier’s widow</q>). In this respect, the assignment of OCCUPATION
                  entities to PERSON entities does not pose an issue. Rather, the difficulty lies in
                  defining the start and the end point of an OCCUPATION tag since, as it can already
                  be seen from the examples above, occupational information frequently includes
                  additional attributive adjectives (e.g. <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de"
                        >burgerl., gew. [gewester]</foreign></hi>). Depending on the semantics of
                  these adjectives, they can either be considered central occupational distinctions
                  (e.g. <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">Kayserlicher
                     Schneider</foreign></hi>
                  <q>imperial tailor</q> vs. <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">Burgerlicher

                  <q>civic tailor</q>) or negligible supplements (e.g. <hi rend="italic"><foreign

                  <q>been</q>).</p>
               <p>As another challenge, various textual elements were discovered that cannot be
                  classified as an occupation, but still reveal essential information about a person
                  and his or her role in society (e.g. <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">hne
                        Condit. [Condition]</foreign></hi>
                  <q>without occupation</q>, <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de"

                  <q>wife</q>). To account for this valuable information as well, a new category and
                  tag was introduced, namely SOCIAL-ROLE, as annotated in the exemplary items
                  below:</p>
               <list type="simple">
                  <item> (11) <hi rend="italic">Der Anna N. ledigem Menschen / in der Roßau / ihr

            <div>
               <head>PLACE</head>
               <p>While information belonging to the categories OCCUPATION and SOCIAL-ROLE is
                  frequently, but not always present in a death list entry, the place of residence
                  and/or death is consistently specified. According to our category system, such
                  toponyms – understood as names for identifiable and thus namable parts of the
                  earth’s surface (cf. <ptr target="#drager_heuser_prinz2021" loc="p. V"/>) – are to
                  be annotated with the tag PLACE. However, it turned out that an even more precise
                  working definition of place names must be available for this purpose. For
                  instance, the prototypical item given in (13), where the life and/or death of the
                  guardsman Gregori Korber is located near (<hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de"
                        >bey</foreign></hi>) the house <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de"
                        >grüne[r] Jäger</foreign></hi> in the urban area of <hi rend="italic"
                        ><foreign xml:lang="de">Lerchenfeld</foreign></hi>, already raises several
                  questions:</p>
               <list type="simple">
                  <item> (13) <hi rend="italic">Gregori Korber / Guardi=Soldat / bey dem grünen
                        Jäger im Lerchenfeld / alt 41. J. </hi>(WD 13.02.1732: 7)</item>
               </list>
               <p>The first thing to ask is which words are specifically part of the toponym to be
                  annotated, i.e. whether to include or exclude preceding definite articles from
                  annotation (<hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">dem grünen
                     Jäger</foreign></hi> vs. <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">grünen
                        Jäger</foreign></hi>). Here, it helps both to compare different texts of the
                  source material with each other and to include further knowledge resources:
                  additional list items showcase a frequent merging of preposition and article (e.g.
                     <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">bey dem &gt; beym</foreign></hi>)
                  which makes it impossible to mark only the latter as part of the place name, and
                  historical city maps (e.g. Steinhausen 1710) refer to houses without articles when
                  listing them in their legend (e.g. <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">gulden
                        Löw, Neue Weldt</foreign></hi>). Thus, both approaches provide arguments for
                  not regarding articles as part of toponyms.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it must be decided whether one (<hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de"
                        >grünen Jäger im Lerchenfeld</foreign></hi>) or two PLACE tags (<hi
                     rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">grünen Jäger, Lerchenfeld</foreign></hi>)
                  should be placed in item (13). As we based the annotation category on the idea of
                  identifying not places but place names, we chose to go with the latter variant.
                  This approach also has the advantages that the extracted spatial entities can both
                  be directly compared and/or linked to other resources and possible spatial
                  relations are made visible through the presence of multiple PLACE tags within a
                  single item. </p>
               <p>Hence, of the four possible ways to allocate the PLACE tag(s) in (13) which are
                  shown in (14), version (14b) is considered the <q>correct</q> way according to our
                  annotation guidelines:</p>

                     </list></item>
               </list>
               <p>In addition to this guidance for assigning PLACE tags, further aspects must be
                  accounted for when annotating toponyms. On the one hand, within the death lists,
                  toponyms may appear not only in the form of proper names but also as appellatives
                  (e.g. <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">Kranken=Haus</foreign></hi>
                  <q>hospital</q>) and, on the other hand, it may be difficult to distinguish
                  between place names and place descriptions, as the following item
                  demonstrates:</p>
               <list type="simple">
                  <item> (15) <hi rend="italic">Dem Lud. Schieber, Maur. s. W. Anna Ma. wo die Jgfer

               </list>
               <p>Although the phrase <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">wo die Jgfer
                        [Jungfer] zum Fenst. [Fenster] aussch. [ausschaut]</foreign></hi>
                  <q>where the spinster looks out the window</q> gives the impression of a place
                  merely being vaguely described instead of precisely located, it is in fact a
                  toponym, namely the name of a concrete house. As the Wien Geschichte Wiki (2022),
                  a historical knowledge platform for Vienna, documents, this house sign stems from
                  a legend: a girl, who had been looking out for her beloved from the window for
                  many weeks during the plague in 1410 and 1411, saw his body in the swollen Alsbach
                  stream flowing past, whereupon she threw herself into the stream and drowned.</p>
               <p>Besides such peculiarities of the historical material, the structure of location
                  information also tends to change over time, as Fischer <ptr target="#fischer2019"
                     loc="pp. 143–144"/> notes: while early death list items usually contained a
                  house, street and/or area name, later entries were often more precise and
                  additionally also included a house number. Accordingly, this can be seen as
                  another starting point for potentially refining the annotation system for specific
                  research interests in the future: for instance, one might want to distinguish
                  between names for different localities (e.g. street, square, district, house) or
                  provide a specific tag for house numbers.</p>

                        Fäulung</foreign></hi>

                  <q>fallen down from the window</q>) may occur. Furthermore, a new agent is
                  introduced in this context, namely an inspecting and/or attesting authority who
                  examines the deceased and officially determines the cause of death, like the Royal

                  interests, such institutional entities could potentially also be assigned a
                  specific annotation tag in the future. But even if this is not the case, the
                  list-internal distinction between official and unofficial causes of death still
                  very much informs the annotation process, as it has proven relevant for list items

               <p>Last but not least, each death list item found in the <title rend="italic"
                     >Diarium</title> includes the age of the deceased person which is to be marked
                  with the tag AGE. An advantage here is that no separation in the sense of
                  PERSON-DECEASED and PERSON-RELATED is necessary, as age statements exclusively
                  refer to deceased and never to related persons. Nevertheless, challenges still
                  arise in regard to tagging death lists according to the AGE category. One is the
                  reappearing question about the limits of what should be annotated; here
                  concretely, whether the recurrent measurement <hi rend="italic"><foreign
                        xml:lang="de">Jahr</foreign></hi>
                  <q>year</q> (abbreviated as <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de"
                     >J.</foreign></hi>) should be considered as part of the age information and
                  thus be annotated (cf. 21a) or whether it should be excluded as redundant (cf.
                  21b):</p>

               </list>
               <p>An answer to this question can be found through further engagement with the
                  textual material: Although first glances into the death lists give readers the
                  impression that the age of deceased persons was exclusively counted in years,
                  closer looks into the historical texts show that a multitude of age measurements
                  can be attested. Besides cases of half years (e.g. <hi rend="italic">2. <foreign
                        xml:lang="de">und ein halb Jahr</foreign></hi>), third years (e.g. <hi
                     rend="italic">3. <foreign xml:lang="de">und ein drittel Jahr</foreign></hi>)
                  and quarter years (e.g. <hi rend="italic">6. <foreign xml:lang="de">Viertl
                        J.</foreign></hi>), also months (e.g. <hi rend="italic">4. <foreign
                        xml:lang="de">Monat</foreign></hi>), weeks (e.g. <hi rend="italic"><foreign
                        xml:lang="de">4 Wochen</foreign></hi>), days (e.g. <hi rend="italic">9.
                        <foreign xml:lang="de">Tag</foreign></hi>) and even hours (e.g. <hi
                     rend="italic">2. <foreign xml:lang="de">Stund</foreign></hi>) were used to
                  quantify the life span of a person.</p>
               <p>For the annotation process, this means that it is of central importance not only
                  to annotate the respective numerical age specification, but also to include its
                  verbal unit of measurement. In general, it has proven useful to take into account
                  verbal supplementary information when annotating age(s). For instance, another
                  special case that needs to be considered are entries where the age of the deceased
                  person seems to have been estimated and is thus preceded by <hi rend="italic"
                        ><foreign xml:lang="de">bey</foreign></hi>, <hi rend="italic"><foreign
                        xml:lang="de">bei</foreign></hi> or <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de"
                        >b</foreign>.</hi>
                  <q>close to, around, approximately</q>, as in (22) and (23):</p>
               <list type="simple">
                  <item> (22) <hi rend="italic">Eine unbekannte Manns=Person / bey der
                        Schlag=Brucken in der Leopold=Stadt / alt bey 60. J.</hi> (WD 11.04.1731:

               </list>
               <p>As demonstrated in the two examples above, we decided to also annotate this
                  lexical marker of age estimation as it makes a viable difference for interpreting
                  a person’s age. This decision was confirmed by further quantitative and
                  qualitative analyses of the death lists’ age statements (cf. <ptr
                     target="#kirchmair_rastinger2021"/>; <ptr
                     target="#rastinger_kirchmair_resch2022"/>), which showed that the small word
                     <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">bei</foreign></hi> is associated with
                  the socio-demographic characteristics of the deceased: especially when documented
                  persons were unknown and/or poor, their age needed to be estimated.</p>

            <head>Possibilities and an exemplary application scenario </head>
            <p>The preceding considerations and reflections on each category document that a
               reliable annotation of our research data is complex and labor-intensive. However, it
               should be emphasized that the annotation of precisely these semi-structured list
               entries is also a rewarding task: ultimately, the annotations make the inherent
               structure of the texts computer-readable, which in turn can become the starting point
               for further research. </p>
            <p>An essential function of categorising this data is its deeper classification, which
               could then be integrated into the existing prototype <title rend="italic"
                  >DIGITARIUM</title> and in this way enrich the edition. The TEI offers extensive
               coding recommendations that would be applicable in the case of persons and places.
               Another advantage would be the retrievability of already annotated entities, which
               could then be searched for specifically, as frequently wished for by users <ptr
                  target="#fischer2019" loc="pp. 149"/>.</p>
            <p>Also, especially important seems to be the fact that reliably annotated data sets
               (like the one described) can be used as a training set for machine analysis methods.
               To use the dataset <quote rend="inline">as a gold standard for both rule-based and
                  machine learning NER approaches</quote>
               <ptr target="#jiang_banchs_li2016"/>, was at the same time one of the primary
               intentions of the annotation project described (cf. <ptr
                  target="#resch_rastinger_kirchmair2022"/>). If such approaches prove successful,
               they can potentially also be applied to other similar texts, e.g. the arrival lists
               of the <title rend="italic">Wien[n]erisches Diarium</title> (cf. Rastinger, 2022) or
               lists in other early modern periodicals.<note> Currently, various NER models that are
                  already available for (historical) German are being evaluated in the course of the
                  City of Vienna funded project <title rend="quotes">Visiting Vienna – digital
                     approaches to the (semi-)automatic analysis of the arrival lists found in the
                        <title rend="italic">Wien[n]erisches Diarium</title></title> (2022–2023, PI:
                  Nina C. Rastinger). </note>
            </p>
            <p>Another important application area that should not be underestimated opens up when
               thinking about the future of annotation: if it is the case that annotation decisions
               will increasingly also be made by artificial intelligence, the definition of sound
               categories determined and approved by experts takes on a special significance as such
               category systems can increase the probability of valid and consistent annotations.
               For instance, when using Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 (<ref
                  target="https://openai.com/gpt-4">https://openai.com/gpt-4</ref>) for NER, users
               are given the possibility to state the labels they would like to use for tagging
               their texts which then, in turn, heavily influences the quality of the output. </p>
            <p>That annotations also enable quantitative analyses <ptr
                  target="#nanni_kuemper_ponzetto2016"/>, and make them more transparent, will
               finally be shown by an exemplary application scenario. From the multitude of
               categories (name, occupation, cause of death etc.), it is the age specifications that
               are visualized here as they allow for automatic extraction over the whole dataset.
               Before being analyzed on a quantitative level, however, these age specifications had
               to be translated from verbal age expressions to numerical values. Hereby, varying
               measurements of age (e.g. years, quarter years, days), as well as graphematic
               variation (e.g. <q>quarter years</q> as <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de"
                     >Vierdtel Jahr</foreign></hi> versus <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de"
                     >Viertel=Jahr</foreign></hi> versus <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de"
                     >Viertl J.</foreign></hi>), needed to be taken into account. Also, the age
               expressions could be given in a half-verbal manner which requires high historical
               knowledge, as their conversion to numbers diverges from contemporary expectations
               multiple times. For example, <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">dritthalb
                     Jahr</foreign></hi>
               <q>three half years</q> must be translated to 2.5 (i.e. 3 minus 0.5) years instead of
               being interpreted as 3.5 (i.e. 3 plus 0.5) years. Through such extensive data
               preparation, the verbal age expressions of 13.084 list items were converted to a
               numerical form and visualized in the graph below, where the age span of the deceased
               in the death lists ranges from two hours to 109 years.</p>
            <figure>
               <head>Fig. 4: Number of deceased persons per age (in years)</head>
               <figDesc>A bar graph showing the number of deceased persons per age, which is counted
                  in years. The highest spikes are given for the ages of one to five years. Also
                  noticeable are the high numbers for the round years, such as 40, 50, 60 or 70,
                  which are clearly above the years surrounding them.</figDesc>
               <graphic url="resources/images/figure04.png"/>
            </figure>

            <p>As shown in the plot, the child mortality in the 18th century can be considered to be
               very high and, in reality, might have been even higher, as, according to Peller <ptr
                  target="#peller1920" loc="p. 229"/>, stillborn children and children in the first
               year of life are often not included in the death lists. While child deaths seem to be
               very common during this time period, cases of centenarians can be considered to be
               relatively rare, since only 20 of them could be observed in our data. What seems to
               be striking are the spikes at round numbers such as 30, 40 or 50. This phenomenon is
               already discussed by an academic in the 18th century, namely by Süßmilch <ptr
                  target="#suessmilch1761" loc="p. 362–363"/>, who clarifies that those spikes must
               not be interpreted as more people dying at a round age, but rather as an artefact of
               a preference for round ages divisible by ten. Stolberg <ptr target="#stolberg2007"
                  loc="p. 50"/> also links these spikes to socio-cultural circumstances and infers
               that the division of life into decades seems to have determined the subjective
               experience of the course of life. As this exemplary use case highlights, annotations
               of the death lists can be deployed very fruitfully for the investigation of mortality
               in the 18th century. However, contextual knowledge is very much needed for
               interpreting the results.</p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <head>Findings and Conclusion</head>
            <p>Based on the examples and the application scenario discussed, it has become clear
               that the annotation of seemingly simple and short list entries can by no means be
               considered a trivial task. Annotating these texts requires specific knowledge and
               great familiarity with the source, including an overview of the time period and
               knowledge of the early modern newspaper landscape. A hurdle that should not be
               underestimated arises from the fact that we are dealing with a level of language that
               is remote in time today, and therefore we cannot always rely on our natural sense of
               language and judgment. In addition to the graphematic variation, which was not at all
               uncommon at the time, there are abbreviations that have become increasingly frequent
               over the course of the century, which make text comprehension more difficult and (as
               in the next example) must be correctly resolved.</p>
            <list type="simple">
               <item> (24) <hi rend="italic">Dem Phil.</hi> [Philip]<hi rend="italic"> Noe, Barb.
                     </hi>[Barbier]<hi rend="italic"> s. </hi>[sein]<hi rend="italic"> W.

                  8)</item>
            </list>
            <p>In order to understand these abbreviations, not only linguistic-historical knowledge
               is needed, but also topographical knowledge of Vienna in the 18th century – the
               letter <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">M</foreign></hi>, for example, can
               stand for <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">Markt</foreign></hi>
               <q>market</q>, <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">"Mühle</foreign></hi>
               <q>mill</q> or more meanings.<note> What has also proven helpful in decoding
                  historical abbreviations so far, has been the creation of an (open-ended) register
                  of abbreviations used in the <title rend="italic">Wien[n]erisches Diarium</title>.
                  This is currently especially done by Thomas Kirchmair as part of his master thesis
                  in the field of Digital Humanities.</note> In all cases of doubt, it is advisable
               to compare the respective entry with others or to search for similar (complete) forms
               that have already occurred and from which the abbreviations can be derived. For the
               recognition of professions that no longer exist today, the annotators will also need
               profound historical-cultural knowledge, otherwise it can happen that an occupation
               (such as <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">Viehmayr</foreign></hi> in the
               following example) is misinterpreted as a personal name.</p>
            <list type="simple">
               <item>(25) <hi rend="italic">Elis. Heimbergerin, Viehmayrs Wit. alt 70 J zu

            </list>
            <p>In the course of the annotation process and the intensive effort to form tangible
               categories, it has become apparent that our understanding of the death lists and
               their entities has deepened increasingly. The initial five categories soon became
               insufficient to adequately describe the lists. The expansion of the original five to
               seven descriptive categories, namely PERSON-DECEASED, PERSON-RELATED, OCCUPATION,
               SOCIAL-ROLE, PLACE, CAUSE-OF-DEATH, and AGE, can therefore also be seen as a
               consequence of a growing comprehension and our competence to make increasingly
               accurate discernments about the texts analysed. If the annotation process is compared
               to a spiral cycle (schematically illustrated in <ptr
                  target="#lemnitzer_zinsmeister2015" loc="p. 103"/>) or to an extended hermeneutic
               circle (cf. <ptr target="#bogeletal2015" loc="p. 124"/>), this annotation cycle can
               theoretically be understood as open-ended.<note> In the course of our paper, we have
                  already discussed several ways in which one could potentially further optimize the
                  presented annotation system for one’s own research needs. One last example for
                  such future adaptions could also be to distinguish between the social role(s) of a
                  deceased vs. a related person.</note>
            </p>
            <p>With this in mind, it is even more important that tools are developed that support
               undogmatic annotation and provide users with the possibility to modify existing as
               well as "create" new tags even during the annotation process (such as CATMA (<ref
                  target="https://catma.de/">https://catma.de</ref>), MAXQDA (<ref
                  target="https://maxqda.com/">https://maxqda.com</ref>) or Annotation Studio (<ref
                  target="https://www.annotationstudio.org/"
               >https://www.annotationstudio.org</ref>), so that researchers can dynamically adapt
               their tagset when they identify limitations and/or contradictions in their initial
               assumptions. </p>
            <p>In practice, these open and flexible annotation cycles, where tagsets are never
               entirely final, are not seldom confronted with a project reality whose reporting does
               not tolerate any postponement or provisionality, but often requires quick decisions.
               It is therefore all the more important to allow sufficient time for annotation
               processes and also to plan for iterative phases of analysis, discussion and
               evaluation. The experience shows that it is worth investing more effort and time in
               this phase of the investigation, since it is often precisely through this continuous
               critical reflection that new insights into the data material are gained. Last but not
               least, a reliable system of categories with well-considered annotations can spark off
               a whole new range of questions and ideally has the potential to become a springboard
               for further research. </p>
