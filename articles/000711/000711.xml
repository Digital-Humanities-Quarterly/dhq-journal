            <head>Introduction</head>
            <p>Digital processes and research practices have given new relevance to the formation of
               categories for textual analysis, as evidenced by the presence and complexity of the
               term <term>annotation</term>. The annotation of data can be seen as a key technique
               in many disciplines (Macmullen, 2005), especially for working with text in the
               Humanities (e.g. Unsworth, 2000), the Computational Sciences (e.g. Sivasothy et al.,
               2021; Doleschal et al., 2022) and subsequently, the Digital Humanities (Caria, and
               Mathiak, 2019). Rehm (2020, p. 299) also reaffirms this, stating that the
                  <ptr/><quote rend="inline">annotation of textual information is one of the most
                  fundamental activities in Linguistics and Computational Linguistics including
                  neighbouring fields such as, among others, Literary Studies, Library Science and
                  Digital Humanities"</quote> . </p>
            <p>In the broad field of Digital Humanities, annotations of text are used in
               multifaceted ways, as they pose a crucial methodological step for the further
               analytical processing of text sources within different analytical procedures
               (Franken, Koch, and Zinsmeister, 2020). For example, they allow for the enrichment of
               a corpus or digital edition with (linguistic) information (e.g. Lu, 2014; Nantke, and
               Schlupkothen, 2020), for the use of close and distant reading methods (e.g. Jänicke
               et al., 2015), or for machine learning techniques (e.g. Fiorucci et al., 2020). </p>
            <p>Annotation can broadly be defined as the <ptr/>
               <quote rend="inline">addition of metadata, comments, markup, or other information
                  that supplements the original data and renders it richer or more
               usable</quote>(Flanders, and Jannidis, 2019, p. 313). It potentially includes the
               assignment of (e.g. descriptive, technical or bibliographical) metadata,
               text-structural information, mark-up on the lexical or grammatical level as well as
               semantic annotations of varying depth or complexity – depending on the objects and
               project goals or research questions (Lordick et al., 2016, p. 188).</p>
            <p>The paper at hand defines annotating as the process in which the segments of a text
               are marked as belonging to a defined category (Reiter, Willand and Gius, 2020, p.
               329), which will be applied for the analysis of death lists in the 18th century
               newspaper <title rend="italic">Wien[n]erisches Diarium</title>. In the course of this
               paper, we will demonstrate, based on concrete examples, how defining categories can
               also be beneficial for the study of toponyms (e.g. Kyriacopoulou, Martineau, and
               Vartampetian 2019; Palladino, 2021) and biographical data (e.g. Aprosio, and Tonelli
               2015). Especially texts with a high information-density, such as the lists
               investigated here, allow for a fruitful application of annotations, making them a
               valuable contribution for digital textual scholarship. However, there is a variety of
               different obstacles and hurdles to overcome when annotating (historical) text, which
               will be described in detail.</p>

            <head>What’s in the news? Historical newspapers as rich knowledge (re)sources</head>
            <p>The paper at hand showcases the use of annotations within the Vienna Time Machine
               project (2020–2022, PI: Claudia Resch), which aims to connect different knowledge
               resources about historical Vienna via Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Linking
               (NEL). More specifically, it discusses the challenges and potentials of annotating
               18th century death lists found in the <title rend="italic">Wien[n]erisches
                  Diarium</title>, an early modern newspaper which was first published in 1703 and
               renamed <title rend="italic">Wiener Zeitung</title> in 1780. For a considerable time
               period during the 18th century, it held the undisputed position of being the most
               important newspaper within the Habsburg Monarchy. The <title rend="italic"
                  >Diarium</title> was published twice a week in its first century, was printed in
               quarto format and contained between 8 and 40 pages, with a considerable increase in
               volume towards the end of the century. The fact that the entire collection as an
               intact body of issues published since its inception has been preserved, substantially
               increases its significance for scholarship.</p>
            <p>The historical <title rend="italic">Wiener Zeitung</title> has already been (partly)
               digitized in form of the so-called <ref target="https://digitarium.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/">
                  <hi rend="italic">DIGITARIUM</hi>
                  <note> The collection was created within the project “Das Wien[n]erische Diarium:
                     Digitaler Datenschatz für die geisteswissenschaftlichen Disziplinen“ (PI:
                     Claudia Resch), which was funded by the “go!digital2.0” program of the Austrian
                     Academy of Sciences and carried out at the Austrian Centre for Digital
                     Humanities and Cultural Heritage (ACDH-CH).</note>

               full-text issues of the newspaper provided as XML/TEI files. As results in
               recognizing the German blackletter typeface with traditional OCR software are usually
               far from satisfactory, the layout and text recognition relied on the HTR technology
               provided by Transkribus. To train an initial model<note> The current model

               were transcribed completely by hand. In order to create a scientifically sound basis
               for a wide range of philological research interests, we preferably avoided
               normalising interventions and the historical language was reproduced as close to the
               printed original as possible. Those resulting reliable transcriptions then served as
               a training and test data (ground truth) set for a new model that was applied to
               further issues, whereby the recognition greatly improved over time (cf. Resch, and
               Kampkaspar, 2019, pp. 56–59). </p>

            <head>Death lists in the <title rend="italic">DI(GIT)ARIUM</title>
            </head>
            <p>The historical <title rend="italic">Wiener Zeitung</title> contains a number of
               different text types, including articles, official announcements and advertisements,
               but also more structured texts, such as arrival or death lists. The focus of this
               article lies on the semi-structured death lists, which do not only appear in almost
               every issue of the newspaper, but are also relatively consistent in their structure
               and display a high semantic density: sorted by date of death and frequently also by
               location (inside vs. outside the city), the persons who died in Vienna since the last
               issue of the newspaper are listed:</p>

            </figure>

            <p>Within the <title rend="italic">DIGITARIUM</title>, each newspaper issue of the
                  <title rend="italic">Diarium</title> was edited using the TEI/P5 guidelines. This
               includes the TEI header and several other elements, as for example divisions
               (&lt;div&gt;), paragraphs (&lt;p&gt;), words (&lt;w&gt;) and highlighted text, to
               distinguish passages or words printed in Antiqua font from its surroundings
               (&lt;hi&gt;). For the structural annotation of the lists, the &lt;list&gt; element
               was used to encode any sequence of items organized as a list. Each distinct item in
               the list was then encoded as a distinct &lt;item&gt; element (see TEI Guidelines,
               Section 3.8). Additionally, (sub-)headings which, in case of the death lists, were
               used to group list entries according to time and/or space were encoded through the
               &lt;head&gt;-element:</p>

               <graphic url="resources/images/figure02.jpg"/>
            </figure>
            <p>Each of these entries or &lt;item&gt;-elements contains detailed information about a
               specific deceased person, for instance their name, occupation, place of death, and
               age. Generally speaking, the process of annotating such entities can be analogue or
               digital, whereas the latter can again be subdivided in manual, semi-automatic and
               fully automatic practices. While analogue annotations serve to organize, structure,
               acquire and pass on knowledge, the digital paradigm exceeds these functions, e.g.
               allowing for the observation of patterns, further processing of the annotations, as
               well as the usage of large amounts of data (Rapp, 2017, pp. 254–255). At the same
               time, especially when processing larger (historical) amounts of data, it is of
               central importance that the category formation and annotation process is
               well-regulated and adheres to clear guidelines. In the special case of death lists in
               historical newspapers such guidelines as well as a category system itself are first
               to be developed, as such texts have so far only been considered for individual
               studies focusing on selected aspects and/or time spans where no systematic annotation
               of the material was carried out (e.g. Peller, 1920).</p>

               linguistic patterns and, based hereon, to develop a first expandable set of
               categories. This bottom-up approach resulted in five preliminary categories, namely
               PERSON, OCCUPATION, PLACE, CAUSE-OF-DEATH and AGE, as annotated in the exemplary item

            <p>The categories derived from the text were color-coded (cf. legend above; Jänicke et
               al., 2015) and, in combination with annotated examples, documented in the form of
               annotation guidelines as intersubjectively applicable and concise as possible. These
               guidelines were then used as concrete aids for decision-making by two researchers
               familiar with the historic material to annotate a randomly drawn and temporally
               distributed sample of 500 death list entries in the browser-based environment Prodigy
               ( <ref target="https://prodi.gy/">https://prodi.gy</ref>). The software provides
               annotators with a graphic user interface, where they are shown one item at a time
               accompanied by the pre-defined tagset:</p>

               <head>Screenshot of the annotation of an exemplary item in Prodigy</head>
               <figDesc>Screenshot from the software Prodigy where the user interface shows the

               <graphic url="resources/images/figure03.png"/>
            </figure>
            <p>Annotations are made by first choosing a tag through clicking on it and then marking
               one or multiple words to which the tag should be assigned. In case of errors or
               re-decisions, markings can be easily deleted and redone. Furthermore, Prodigy allows
               for unclear items to be omitted and for multiple users to (re-)annotate the same
               dataset.</p>
            <p>During this annotation process, the emphasis was put especially on emerging
               ‘challenging’ cases, i.e. items where annotators were in doubt about their choice of
               category, the exact positioning of annotations or the necessity to annotate certain
               entities at all. Whenever annotators encountered ambiguous items, these were
               collected, grouped and – as a third step in the annotation process – discussed within
               the interdisciplinary team of philologists, historians and prosopographers. Within
               this collective, a solution for each group of issues was agreed on and incorporated
               into the annotation guidelines. As a consequence, existing categories were revised
               where necessary. The new, more stable and mature category system was then again used
               for a new sequence of annotation and discussion of ambiguities, resulting in an
               iterative process where annotation and category development became intertwined. This
               approach roughly corresponds to Rapp’s (2017, pp. 256–257) basic notion of an
               annotation process, which she breaks down into the following five steps: it involves
               an initial exploratory data analysis, an initial definition of categories and
               formulation of guidelines, the annotation itself, an evaluation, and the repetition
               of these steps. Concrete findings that emerged through this process are discussed in
               the following sections on the basis of sample items. </p>

               <head>PERSON</head>
               <p>Since each death list item documents one person that died in- or outside the City
                  of Vienna, the tag PERSON can be considered fundamental for the annotation task.
                  It refers to information identifying the individual whose death is detailed,
                  specifically, their first and/or last name, as given in (2): </p>

               </list>
               <p>However, not every death list entry follows the prototypical pattern of [first
                  name] + [last name] given in (2) which provides annotators with a clear conception
                  of where the PERSON tag should start and end. Instead, items can also, among other
                  things, involve maternal names (cf. 3), additional titles (cf. 4), and even
                  unnamed persons (cf. 5). In order to facilitate later disambiguation and to
                  distinguish items with unknown persons from items missing an annotation tag, we
                  decided to also subsume such (as well as similar) cases of additional identity
                  information under the PERSON tag:</p>

               <p>However, not all issues encountered when annotating could be solved solely by
                  widening (or narrowing) the scope of the PERSON category. For instance, as example
                  (3) has already depicted, one death list entry might contain references to more
                  than one (named) person: As women (e.g. <ptr target="Walburga"/> in 6) and
                  children (e.g. <ptr target="Joseph"/> in 7) were considered less autonomous than
                  men, no separate entry is recorded under their name; rather, they are identifiable
                  by the mention of their husband (cf. <ptr target="Karl Wesselly"/> in 6) or father
                  (e.g. <ptr target="Friedrich Eysenhut"/> in 7):</p>

               <p>It might be argued that one could simply use the sequence of person entities in
                  each item to discriminate the related (first named) from the deceased person
                  (second named). However, not all items that include two or more persons
                  necessarily express a kinship or partnership relation. The entry shown in (8), for
                  example, accumulates three deceased persons whose only (known) connection is their
                  same place of death, namely the city hospital:</p>

               </list>
               <p>Due to such cases as well as the high frequency of items involving more than one
                  person, an adjustment of the initial tagset was deemed necessary: instead of
                  assigning the overarching tag PERSON to all (un-)named persons, the category was
                  split into two separate tags, namely PERSON-DECEASED and PERSON-RELATED. Although
                  this conceptualisation is currently sufficient for our research interests, further
                  sub-categories are certainly possible. For instance, depending on the respective
                  purpose, one could additionally distinguish between first, second and last name,
                  or between maternal and married name. </p>

               <head>OCCUPATION</head>
               <p>Another type of personal information included in (almost) all death list entries
                  is occupational information. Here, in contrast to the previous category, no
                  additional distinction between the occupation of a deceased person and the
                  occupation of a relative/spouse needs to be made since given occupation titles
                  generally refer to male persons:<note> In very rare cases, an occupation is also
                     attributed to women, but in this case no male person is part of the respective

               <p>In (9) the deceased himself is an innkeeper (<ptr target="Wirth"/>), while in (10)
                  it is the father of the deceased child whose profession (<ptr
                     target="burgerl. Fleisch=hacker"/> ‘civic butcher’) is mentioned by name. The
                  same principle applies to death list entries for married women and partly even
                  widows (e.g. <ptr target="Glasermeist. Witw."/> ‘master glazier’s widow’). In this
                  respect, the assignment of OCCUPATION entities to PERSON entities does not pose an
                  issue. Rather, the difficulty lies in defining the start and the end point of an
                  OCCUPATION tag since, as it can already be seen from the examples above,
                  occupational information frequently includes additional attributive adjectives
                  (e.g. <ptr target="burgerl."/>, <ptr target="gew. [gewester]"/>). Depending on the
                  semantics of these adjectives, they can either be considered central occupational
                  distinctions (e.g. <ptr target="Kayserlicher Schneider"/> ‘imperial tailor’ vs.
                     <ptr target="Burgerlicher Schneider"/> ‘civic tailor’) or negligible
                  supplements (e.g. <ptr target="gewester"/> ‘been’).</p>
               <p>As another challenge, various textual elements were discovered that cannot be
                  classified as an occupation, but still reveal essential information about a person
                  and his or her role in society (e.g. <ptr target="ohne Condit. [Condition]"/>
                  ‘without occupation’, <ptr target="Wittwe"/> ‘widow’, <ptr
                     target="verh. [verheiratet]"/> ‘married’, <ptr target="Kind"/> ‘child’, <ptr
                     target="armes Mensch"/> ‘poor person’, <ptr target="Töchterl"/> ‘daughter’,
                     <ptr target="Weib"/> ‘wife’). To account for this valuable information as well,
                  a new category and tag was introduced, namely SOCIAL-ROLE, as annotated in the
                  exemplary items below:</p>
               <list type="simple">
                  <item> (11)<hi rend="italic">Der Anna N. ledigem Menschen / in der Roßau / ihr

            <div>
               <head>PLACE</head>
               <p>While information belonging to the categories OCCUPATION and SOCIAL-ROLE is
                  frequently, but not always present in a death list entry, the place of residence
                  and/or death is consistently specified. According to our category system, such
                  toponyms – understood as names for identifiable and thus namable parts of the
                  earth’s surface (cf. Dräger, Heuser, and Prinz, 2021, p. V) – are to be annotated
                  with the tag PLACE. However, it turned out that an even more precise working
                  definition of place names must be available for this purpose. For instance, the
                  prototypical item given in (13), where the life and/or death of the guardsman
                  Gregori Korber is located near (<ptr target="bey"/>) the house <ptr
                     target="grüne[r] Jäger"/> in the urban area of <ptr target="Lerchenfeld"/>,
                  already raises several questions:</p>
               <list type="simple">
                  <item> (13)<hi rend="italic">Gregori Korber / Guardi=Soldat / bey dem grünen Jäger
                        im Lerchenfeld / alt 41. J. </hi>(WD 13.02.1732: 7)</item>
               </list>
               <p>The first thing to ask is which words are specifically part of the toponym to be
                  annotated, i.e. whether to include or exclude preceding definite articles from
                  annotation (<ptr target="dem grünen Jäger"/> vs. <ptr target="grünen Jäger"/>).
                  Here, it helps both to compare different texts of the source material with each
                  other and to include further knowledge resources: additional list items showcase a
                  frequent merging of preposition and article (e.g. <ptr target="bey dem"/> &gt;
                     <ptr target="beym"/>) which makes it impossible to mark only the latter as part
                  of the place name, and historical city maps (e.g. Steinhausen 1710) refer to
                  houses without articles when listing them in their legend (e.g. <ptr
                     target="gulden Löw"/>, <ptr target="Neue Weldt"/>). Thus, both approaches
                  provide arguments for not regarding articles as part of toponyms.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it must be decided whether one (<ptr
                     target="grünen Jäger im Lerchenfeld"/>) or two PLACE tags (<ptr
                     target="grünen Jäger"/>, <ptr target="Lerchenfeld"/>) should be placed in item
                  (13). As we based the annotation category on the idea of identifying not places
                  but place names, we chose to go with the latter variant. This approach also has
                  the advantages that the extracted spatial entities can both be directly compared
                  and/or linked to other resources and possible spatial relations are made visible
                  through the presence of multiple PLACE tags within a single item. </p>
               <p>Hence, of the four possible ways to allocate the PLACE tag(s) in (13) which are
                  shown in (14), version (14b) is considered the ‘correct’ way according to our
                  annotation guidelines:</p>

               <p>In addition to this guidance for assigning PLACE tags, further aspects must be
                  accounted for when annotating toponyms. On the one hand, within the death lists,
                  toponyms may appear not only in the form of proper names but also as appellatives
                  (e.g. <ptr target="Kranken=Haus"/> ‘hospital’) and, on the other hand, it may be
                  difficult to distinguish between place names and place descriptions, as the

               <p>Although the phrase <ptr
                     target="wo die Jgfer [Jungfer] zum Fenst. [Fenster] aussch. [ausschaut]"/>
                  ‘where the spinster looks out the window’ gives the impression of a place merely
                  being vaguely described instead of precisely located, it is in fact a toponym,
                  namely the name of a concrete house. As the Wien Geschichte Wiki (2022), a
                  historical knowledge platform for Vienna, documents, this house sign stems from a
                  legend: a girl, who had been looking out for her beloved from the window for many
                  weeks during the plague in 1410 and 1411, saw his body in the swollen Alsbach
                  stream flowing past, whereupon she threw herself into the stream and drowned.</p>
               <p>Besides such peculiarities of the historical material, the structure of location
                  information also tends to change over time, as Fischer (2019, pp. 143–144) notes:
                  while early death list items usually contained a house, street and/or area name,
                  later entries were often more precise and additionally also included a house
                  number. Accordingly, this can be seen as another starting point for potentially
                  refining the annotation system for specific research interests in the future: for
                  instance, one might want to distinguish between names for different localities
                  (e.g. street, square, district, house) or provide a specific tag for house
                  numbers.</p>

               <p>Besides the aspects already discussed, some (esp. early) death lists also
                  contained the cause of death for certain persons, which could, among other things,
                  be a disease (cf. 16), an accident (cf. 17) or a crime (cf. 18):</p>

               <p>As indicated by these examples, textual elements that are to be tagged with
                  CAUSE-OF-DEATH can be given in various grammatical forms; for instance, both nouns
                  and noun phrases (e.g. <ptr target="innerliche Fäulung"/> ‘internal rot’, <ptr
                     target="Hectica=Fieber"/> ‘Hectica fever’) as well as adjectives, verbs and
                  verbal phrases (e.g. <ptr target="erstochen"/> ‘stabbed’, <ptr
                     target="vom Fenster herunter gefallen"/> ‘fallen down from the window’) may
                  occur. Furthermore, a new agent is introduced in this context, namely an
                  inspecting and/or attesting authority who examines the deceased and officially
                  determines the cause of death, like the Royal City Court (<ptr
                     target="Königl. Stadt=Gericht"/>) in (17). Depending on one’s research
                  interests, such institutional entities could potentially also be assigned a
                  specific annotation tag in the future. But even if this is not the case, the
                  list-internal distinction between official and unofficial causes of death still
                  very much informs the annotation process, as it has proven relevant for list items
                  which include both a description of the death situation (cf. underlinings) and the
                  result of the pathological examination:</p>

               <p>For the sake of clarity and with the prospect of automatic analysis of the
                  annotations, officially authorised causes of death were given precedence over
                  unofficial observations and thus annotated solely when present. Only if no
                  official statement concerning the cause of death was provided in a list entry,
                  other (descriptive) information about it was marked.</p>

               <p>Last but not least, each death list item found in the <title rend="italic"

                  PERSON-DECEASED and PERSON-RELATED is necessary, as age statements exclusively
                  refer to deceased and never to related persons. Nevertheless, challenges still
                  arise in regard to tagging death lists according to the AGE category. One is the
                  reappearing question about the limits of what should be annotated; here
                  concretely, whether the recurrent measurement <ptr target="Jahr"/> ‘year’
                  (abbreviated as <ptr target="J."/>) should be considered as part of the age
                  information and thus be annotated (cf. 21a) or whether it should be excluded as
                  redundant (cf. 21b):</p>

               <p>An answer to this question can be found through further engagement with the
                  textual material: Although first glances into the death lists give readers the
                  impression that the age of deceased persons was exclusively counted in years,
                  closer looks into the historical texts show that a multitude of age measurements
                  can be attested. Besides cases of half years (e.g. <ptr
                     target="2. und ein halb Jahr"/>), third years (e.g. <ptr
                     target="3. und ein drittel Jahr"/>) and quarter years (e.g. <ptr
                     target="6. Viertl J."/>), also months (e.g. <ptr target="4. Monat"/>), weeks
                  (e.g. <ptr target="4 Wochen"/>), days (e.g. <ptr target="9. Tag"/>) and even hours
                  (e.g. <ptr target="2. Stund"/>) were used to quantify the life span of a
                  person.</p>
               <p>For the annotation process, this means that it is of central importance not only
                  to annotate the respective numerical age specification, but also to include its
                  verbal unit of measurement. In general, it has proven useful to take into account
                  verbal supplementary information when annotating age(s). For instance, another
                  special case that needs to be considered are entries where the age of the deceased
                  person seems to have been estimated and is thus preceded by <ptr target="bey"/>
                  <hi rend="italic">, </hi>
                  <ptr target="bei"/> or <ptr target="b."/> ‘close to, around, approximately’, as in
                  (22) and (23):</p>

               <p>As demonstrated in the two examples above, we decided to also annotate this
                  lexical marker of age estimation as it makes a viable difference for interpreting
                  a person’s age. This decision was confirmed by further quantitative and
                  qualitative analyses of the death lists’ age statements (cf. Kirchmair, and
                  Rastinger, 2021; Rastinger, Kirchmair, and Resch, 2022), which showed that the
                  small word <ptr target="bei"/> is associated with the socio-demographic
                  characteristics of the deceased: especially when documented persons were unknown
                  and/or poor, their age needed to be estimated.</p>

            <head>Possibilities and an exemplary application scenario </head>
            <p>The preceding considerations and reflections on each category document that a
               reliable annotation of our research data is complex and labor-intensive. However, it
               should be emphasized that the annotation of precisely these semi-structured list
               entries is also a rewarding task: ultimately, the annotations make the inherent
               structure of the texts computer-readable, which in turn can become the starting point
               for further research. </p>
            <p>An essential function of categorising this data is its deeper classification, which
               could then be integrated into the existing prototype <title rend="italic"
                  >DIGITARIUM</title> and in this way enrich the edition. The TEI offers extensive
               coding recommendations that would be applicable in the case of persons and places.
               Another advantage would be the retrievability of already annotated entities, which
               could then be searched for specifically, as frequently wished for by users (Fischer,
               2019, p. 149).</p>
            <p>Also, especially important seems to be the fact that reliably annotated data sets
               (like the one described) can be used as a training set for machine analysis methods.
               To use the dataset <ptr
                  target="as a gold standard for both rule-based and machine learning NER approaches"
               /> (Jiang, Banchs, and Li, 2016), was at the same time one of the primary intentions
               of the annotation project described (cf. Resch, Rastinger, and Kirchmair, 2022). If
               such approaches prove successful, they can potentially also be applied to other
               similar texts, e.g. the arrival lists of the <title rend="italic">Wien[n]erisches
                  Diarium</title> (cf. Rastinger, 2022) or lists in other early modern
                  periodicals.<note> Currently, various NER models that are already available for
                  (historical) German are being evaluated in the course of the City of Vienna funded
                  project “Visiting Vienna – digital approaches to the (semi-)automatic analysis of
                  the arrival lists found in the <title rend="italic">Wien[n]erisches
                     Diarium</title>” (2022–2023, PI: Nina C. Rastinger). </note>
            </p>
            <p>Another important application area that should not be underestimated opens up when
               thinking about the future of annotation: if it is the case that annotation decisions
               will increasingly also be made by artificial intelligence, the definition of sound
               categories determined and approved by experts takes on a special significance as such
               category systems can increase the probability of valid and consistent annotations.
               For instance, when using Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 (<ref
                  target="https://openai.com/gpt-4">https://openai.com/gpt-4</ref>) for NER, users
               are given the possibility to state the labels they would like to use for tagging
               their texts which then, in turn, heavily influences the quality of the output. </p>
            <p>That annotations also enable quantitative analyses (Nanni, Kümper, and Ponzetto,
               2016), and make them more transparent, will finally be shown by an exemplary
               application scenario. From the multitude of categories (name, occupation, cause of
               death etc.), it is the age specifications that are visualized here as they allow for
               automatic extraction over the whole dataset. Before being analyzed on a quantitative
               level, however, these age specifications had to be translated from verbal age
               expressions to numerical values. Hereby, varying measurements of age (e.g. years,
               quarter years, days), as well as graphematic variation (e.g. ‘quarter years’ as <ptr
                  target="Vierdtel Jahr"/> versus <ptr target="Viertel=Jahr"/> versus <ptr
                  target="Viertl J."/>), needed to be taken into account. Also, the age expressions
               could be given in a half-verbal manner which requires high historical knowledge, as
               their conversion to numbers diverges from contemporary expectations multiple times.
               For example, <ptr target="dritthalb Jahr"/> ‘three half years’ must be translated to
               2.5 (i.e. 3 minus 0.5) years instead of being interpreted as 3.5 (i.e. 3 plus 0.5)
               years. Through such extensive data preparation, the verbal age expressions of 13.084
               list items were converted to a numerical form and visualized in the graph below,
               where the age span of the deceased in the death lists ranges from two hours to 109
               years.</p>

            <p>As shown in the plot, the child mortality in the 18th century can be considered to be
               very high and, in reality, might have been even higher, as, according to Peller
               (1920, p. 229), stillborn children and children in the first year of life are often
               not included in the death lists. While child deaths seem to be very common during
               this time period, cases of centenarians can be considered to be relatively rare,
               since only 20 of them could be observed in our data. What seems to be striking are
               the spikes at round numbers such as 30, 40 or 50. This phenomenon is already
               discussed by an academic in the 18th century, namely by Süßmilch (1761, p. 362–363),
               who clarifies that those spikes must not be interpreted as more people dying at a
               round age, but rather as an artefact of a preference for round ages divisible by ten.
               Stolberg (2007, p. 50) also links these spikes to socio-cultural circumstances and
               infers that the division of life into decades seems to have determined the subjective
               experience of the course of life. As this exemplary use case highlights, annotations
               of the death lists can be deployed very fruitfully for the investigation of mortality
               in the 18th century. However, contextual knowledge is very much needed for
               interpreting the results.</p>

            <head>Findings and Conclusion</head>
            <p>Based on the examples and the application scenario discussed, it has become clear
               that the annotation of seemingly simple and short list entries can by no means be
               considered a trivial task. Annotating these texts requires specific knowledge and
               great familiarity with the source, including an overview of the time period and
               knowledge of the early modern newspaper landscape. A hurdle that should not be
               underestimated arises from the fact that we are dealing with a level of language that
               is remote in time today, and therefore we cannot always rely on our natural sense of
               language and judgment. In addition to the graphematic variation, which was not at all
               uncommon at the time, there are abbreviations that have become increasingly frequent
               over the course of the century, which make text comprehension more difficult and (as
               in the next example) must be correctly resolved.</p>

            <p>In order to understand these abbreviations, not only linguistic-historical knowledge
               is needed, but also topographical knowledge of Vienna in the 18th century – the
               letter <ptr target="M"/>, for example, can stand for <ptr target="Markt"/> ‘market’,
                  <ptr target="Mühle"/> ‘mill’ or more meanings.<note> What has also proven helpful
                  in decoding historical abbreviations so far, has been the creation of an
                  (open-ended) register of abbreviations used in the <title rend="italic"
                     >Wien[n]erisches Diarium</title>. This is currently especially done by Thomas
                  Kirchmair as part of his master thesis in the field of Digital Humanities.</note>
               In all cases of doubt, it is advisable to compare the respective entry with others or
               to search for similar (complete) forms that have already occurred and from which the
               abbreviations can be derived. For the recognition of professions that no longer exist
               today, the annotators will also need profound historical-cultural knowledge,
               otherwise it can happen that an occupation (such as <ptr target="Viehmayr"/> in the
               following example) is misinterpreted as a personal name.</p>

            <p>In the course of the annotation process and the intensive effort to form tangible
               categories, it has become apparent that our understanding of the death lists and
               their entities has deepened increasingly. The initial five categories soon became
               insufficient to adequately describe the lists. The expansion of the original five to
               seven descriptive categories, namely PERSON-DECEASED, PERSON-RELATED, OCCUPATION,
               SOCIAL-ROLE, PLACE, CAUSE-OF-DEATH, and AGE, can therefore also be seen as a
               consequence of a growing comprehension and our competence to make increasingly
               accurate discernments about the texts analysed. If the annotation process is compared
               to a spiral cycle (schematically illustrated in Lemnitzer, and Zinsmeister, 2015, p.
               103) or to an extended hermeneutic circle (cf. Bögel et al., 2015, p. 124), this
               annotation cycle can theoretically be understood as open-ended.<note> In the course
                  of our paper, we have already discussed several ways in which one could
                  potentially further optimize the presented annotation system for one’s own
                  research needs. One last example for such future adaptions could also be to
                  distinguish between the social role(s) of a deceased vs. a related person.</note>
            </p>
            <p>With this in mind, it is even more important that tools are developed that support
               undogmatic annotation and provide users with the possibility to modify existing as
               well as "create" new tags even during the annotation process (such as CATMA (<ref
                  target="https://catma.de/">https://catma.de</ref>), MAXQDA (<ref
                  target="https://maxqda.com/">https://maxqda.com</ref>) or Annotation Studio (<ref
                  target="https://www.annotationstudio.org/"
               >https://www.annotationstudio.org</ref>), so that researchers can dynamically adapt
               their tagset when they identify limitations and/or contradictions in their initial
               assumptions. </p>
            <p>In practice, these open and flexible annotation cycles, where tagsets are never
               entirely final, are not seldom confronted with a project reality whose reporting does
               not tolerate any postponement or provisionality, but often requires quick decisions.
               It is therefore all the more important to allow sufficient time for annotation
               processes and also to plan for iterative phases of analysis, discussion and
               evaluation. The experience shows that it is worth investing more effort and time in
               this phase of the investigation, since it is often precisely through this continuous
               critical reflection that new insights into the data material are gained. Last but not
               least, a reliable system of categories with well-considered annotations can spark off
               a whole new range of questions and ideally has the potential to become a springboard
               for further research. </p>
