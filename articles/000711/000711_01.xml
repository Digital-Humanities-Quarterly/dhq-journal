        <p>Annotating – understood here as the process in which segments of a text are marked as belonging to a defined
          category <ptr target="#reiter_willand_gius2020"/> – can be seen as a key technique in many disciplines <ptr target="#macmullen2005"/>, especially for working with text in the Humanities [e.g. Unsworth 2000], the
          Computational Sciences (e.g. <ptr target="#sivasothyetal2021"/>; <ptr target="#doleschaletal2022"/>), and the
          Digital Humanities <ptr target="#caria_mathiak2019"/>. In the field of Digital Humanities, annotations of text are
          utilized, among other purposes, for the enrichment of a corpus or digital edition with (linguistic) information
          (e.g. <ptr target="#lu2014"/>; <ptr target="#nantke_schlupkothen2020"/>), for close and distant reading methods
          (e.g. <ptr target="#jaenickeetal2015"/>), or for machine learning techniques (e.g. <ptr target="#fioruccietal2020"/>). Defining categories to shape data has been used in different text analysis contexts, including the study of
          toponyms (e.g. <ptr target="#kyriacopoulou2019"/>) and biographical data (e.g. <ptr target="#aprosio_tonelli2015"/>).</p>
        <p>The paper at hand showcases the use of annotations within the Vienna Time Machine project (2020-2022, PI: Claudia
          Resch) which aims to connect different knowledge resources about historical Vienna via Named Entity Recognition
          (NER). More specifically, it discusses the challenges and potentials of annotating 18th century death lists found
          in the <title rend="italic">Wien[n]erisches Diarium</title> or <title rend="italic">Wiener Zeitung</title>, an
          early modern newspaper which was first published in 1703 and has already been (partly) digitized in form of the
          so-called DIGITARIUM <ptr target="#resch_kampkaspar2019"/>: Here, users can access over 330 high-quality full text
          issues of the newspaper which contain a number of different text types, including articles, advertisements and more
          structured texts, such as arrival or death lists. The focus of this article lies on the semi-structured death
          lists, which do not only appear in almost every issue of the historical <title rend="italic">Wiener
          Zeitung</title>, but are also relatively consistent in their structure and display a high semantic density: Each
          entry contains detailed information about a deceased person, such as their name, occupation, place of death, and
          age.</p>
        <p>Annotating these semi-structured list items opens up multiple possibilities: The resulting classified data can be
          used for efficient distant or scalable reading, quantitative analyses <ptr target="#nanni_kuemper_ponzetto2016"/>,
          and as a gold standard for both rule-based and machine learning NER approaches (e.g. <ptr target="#jiang_banchs_li2016"/>). To reach this goal and as a first step of the annotation process, the project
          team conducted a close reading of various death lists from multiple decades to identify recurrent linguistic
          patterns and, based hereon, to develop a first expandable set of categories. This bottom-up approach resulted in
          five preliminary categories, namely PERSON, OCCUPATION, PLACE, AGE and CAUSE-OF-DEATH, which were color-coded <ptr target="#jaenickeetal2015"/> and, accompanied by annotated examples, documented in the form of annotation
          guidelines as intersubjectively applicable and concise as possible. These guidelines were then used by two
          researchers familiar with the historic material to annotate a randomly drawn and temporally distributed sample of
          500 death list entries in the browser-based environment Prodigy (<ref target="https://prodi.gy">https://prodi.gy</ref>). Hereby, the emphasis was put especially on emerging <q>challenging</q> cases, i.e. items
          where annotators were in doubt about their choice of category, the exact positioning of annotations or the
          necessity to annotate certain text segments at all. Whenever annotators encountered such ambiguous items, these
          were collected, grouped and – as a third step in the annotation process – discussed with an interdisciplinary group
          of linguists, historians and prosopographers. Within this collective, a solution for each group of issues was
          agreed on and incorporated into the annotation guidelines. Also, existing categories were revised where necessary.
          The new, more stable category system was then again used for a new sequence of annotation and discussion of
          ambiguities, resulting in an iterative process where annotation and category development became intertwined. This
          approach, explained in the article in more detail, demonstrates that tagsets are never entirely final, but always
          depend on particular knowledge interests and data material and that even the annotation of inherently
          semi-structured lists requires continuous critical reflection and considerable historical and linguistic
          knowledge.</p>
        <p>At the same time, it can be exemplified by this work that it is precisely these <q>challenging</q> cases which
          carry a great potential for gaining knowledge and can be considered central to the development of a valid
          annotation system (cf. <ptr target="#franken_koch_zinsmeister2020"/>).</p>

        <head>Introduction</head>
        <p>Digital processes and research practices have given new relevance to the formation of categories for textual
          analysis, as evidenced by the presence and complexity of the term <term>annotation</term>. The annotation of data
          can be seen as a key technique in many disciplines <ptr target="#macmullen2005"/>, especially for working with text
          in the Humanities (e.g. Unsworth, 2000), the Computational Sciences (e.g. <ptr target="#sivasothyetal2021"/>; <ptr target="#doleschaletal2022"/>) and subsequently, the Digital Humanities <ptr target="#caria_mathiak2019"/>. Rehm
          <ptr target="#rehm2020" loc="p. 299"/> also reaffirms this, stating that the <quote rend="inline">annotation of
          textual information is one of the most fundamental activities in Linguistics and Computational Linguistics
          including neighbouring fields such as, among others, Literary Studies, Library Science and Digital
          Humanities</quote>. </p>
        <p>In the broad field of Digital Humanities, annotations of text are used in multifaceted ways, as they pose a
          crucial methodological step for the further analytical processing of text sources within different analytical
          procedures <ptr target="#franken_koch_zinsmeister2020"/>. For example, they allow for the enrichment of a corpus or
          digital edition with (linguistic) information (e.g. <ptr target="#lu2014"/>; <ptr target="#nantke_schlupkothen2020"/>), for the use of close and distant reading methods (e.g. <ptr target="#jaenickeetal2015"/>), or for machine
          learning techniques (e.g. <ptr target="#fioruccietal2020"/>). </p>
        <p>Annotation can broadly be defined as the <quote rend="inline">addition of metadata, comments, markup, or other
          information that supplements the original data and renders it richer or more usable</quote> <ptr target="#flanders_jannidis2019" loc="p. 313"/>. It potentially includes the assignment of (e.g. descriptive,
          technical or bibliographical) metadata, text-structural information, mark-up on the lexical or grammatical level as
          well as semantic annotations of varying depth or complexity – depending on the objects and project goals or
          research questions <ptr target="#lordick_etal2016" loc="p. 188"/>.</p>
        <p>The paper at hand defines annotating as the process in which segments of a text are marked as belonging to a
          defined category <ptr target="#reiter_willand_gius2020" loc="p. 329"/>, which will be applied for the analysis of
          death lists in the 18th century newspaper <title rend="italic">Wien[n]erisches Diarium</title>. In the course of
          this paper, we will demonstrate, based on concrete examples, how defining categories can also be beneficial for the
          study of toponyms (e.g. <ptr target="#kyriacopoulou2019"/>; <ptr target="#palladino2021"/>) and biographical data
          (e.g. <ptr target="#aprosio_tonelli2015"/>). Especially texts with a high information-density, such as the lists
          investigated here, allow for a fruitful application of annotations, making them a valuable contribution for digital
          textual scholarship. However, there is a variety of different obstacles and hurdles to overcome when annotating
          (historical) text, which will be described in detail.</p>

        <p>The paper at hand showcases the use of annotations within the Vienna Time Machine project (2020–2022, PI: Claudia
          Resch), which aims to connect different knowledge resources about historical Vienna via Named Entity Recognition
          (NER). More specifically, it discusses the challenges and potentials of annotating 18th century death lists found
          in the <title rend="italic">Wien[n]erisches Diarium</title>, an early modern newspaper which was first published in
          1703 and renamed <title rend="italic">Wiener Zeitung</title> in 1780. For a considerable time period during the
          18th century, it held the undisputed position of being the most important newspaper within the Habsburg Monarchy.
          The <title rend="italic">Diarium</title> was published twice a week in its first century, was printed in quarto
          format and contained between 8 and 40 pages, with a considerable increase in volume towards the end of the century.
          The fact that the entire collection as an intact body of issues published since its inception has been preserved,
          substantially increases its significance for scholarship.</p>
        <p>The historical <title rend="italic">Wiener Zeitung</title> has already been (partly) digitized in form of the
          so-called <ref target="https://digitarium.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/"> <hi rend="italic">DIGITARIUM</hi> <note> The

          here, users can access over 330 high-quality full-text issues of the newspaper provided as XML/TEI files. As
          results in recognizing the German blackletter typeface with traditional OCR software are usually far from
          satisfactory, the layout and text recognition relied on the HTR technology provided by Transkribus. To train an
          initial model<note> The current model specifically trained on 829 400 words from the <title rend="italic">Diarium</title> is already publicly available as <title rend="quotes">German Fraktur 18th century</title>, see
          <ref target="https://readcoop.eu/model/german-fraktur-18th-century/">readcoop.eu/model/german-fraktur-18th-century/</ref>.</note>, selected issues were transcribed completely by hand.
          In order to create a scientifically sound basis for a wide range of philological research interests, we preferably
          avoided normalising interventions and the historical language was reproduced as close to the printed original as
          possible. Those resulting reliable transcriptions then served as a training and test data set (ground truth) for a
          new model that was applied to further issues, whereby the recognition greatly improved over time <ptr target="#resch_kampkaspar2019" loc="pp. 56–59"/>.</p>

        <p>Within the <title rend="italic">DIGITARIUM</title>, each newspaper issue of the <title rend="italic">Diarium</title> was edited using the TEI/P5 guidelines. This includes the TEI header and several other elements,
          as for example divisions (&lt;div&gt;), paragraphs (&lt;p&gt;), words (&lt;w&gt;) and highlighted text, to
          distinguish passages or words printed in Antiqua font from its surroundings (&lt;hi&gt;). For the structural
          annotation of lists, the &lt;list&gt; element was used to encode any sequence of items organized as a list. Each
          distinct item in the list was then encoded as a distinct &lt;item&gt; element (see TEI Guidelines, Section 3.8).
          Additionally, (sub-)headings which, in case of the death lists, were used to group list entries according to time
          and/or space were encoded through the &lt;head&gt;-element:</p>
        <figure xml:id="figure02">
          <head>Exemplary XML/TEI extract of the death list shown in Figure 1</head>
          <figDesc>An extract from the XML/TEI file of the death list shown in Figure 1, which includes, among other things,
            a head-element and a list-element containing two item-elements</figDesc>
          <graphic url="resources/images/figure02.jpg" style="width: 500px"/>
        </figure>
        <p>Each of these entries or &lt;item&gt;-elements contains detailed information about a specific deceased person, for
          instance their name, occupation, place of death, and age. Generally speaking, the process of annotating such
          entities can be analogue or digital, whereas the latter can again be subdivided in manual, semi-automatic and fully
          automatic practices. While analogue annotations serve to organize, structure, acquire and pass on knowledge, the
          digital paradigm exceeds these functions, e.g. allowing for the observation of patterns, further processing of the
          annotations, as well as the usage of large amounts of data <ptr target="#rapp2017" loc="pp. 254–255"/>. At the same
          time, especially when processing larger (historical) amounts of data, it is of central importance that the category
          formation and annotation process is well-regulated and adheres to clear guidelines. In the special case of death
          lists in historical newspapers such guidelines as well as a category system itself are first to be developed, as
          such texts have so far only been considered for individual studies focusing on selected aspects and/or time spans
          where no systematic annotation of the material was carried out (e.g. <ptr target="#peller1920"/>).</p>

        <head>Annotation process</head>
        <p>To reach this goal and as a first step of the annotation process, the project team<note> The annotation was
          essentially done by the authors of this paper, who come from the field of digital philology and have (in some cases
          many years of) experience with digital methods on the one hand and on the other hand have already worked
          intensively with older language stages, annotations problems associated with non-standard historical varieties of
          German and with these newspaper texts in particular. Georg Vogeler and Matthias Schlögl contributed to our
          discussions in an advisory capacity as experts in history and prosopography.</note> conducted a close reading of
          various death lists from multiple decades to identify recurrent linguistic patterns and, based hereon, to develop a
          first expandable set of categories. This bottom-up approach resulted in five preliminary categories, namely PERSON,
          OCCUPATION, PLACE, CAUSE-OF-DEATH and AGE, as annotated in the exemplary item below:</p>
        <list type="simple">
          <item> <p>(1) <hi rend="italic">Der Johann Rendt / ein Zuckerbacher in Berdronischen Hauß in Offenloch ist an der
            Lungelsucht beschaut alt 35. Jahr. </hi>(WD 08.08.1703: 9<note> Here and in the following sections, text passages
            from the <title rend="italic">Wien[n]erisches Diarium</title> (WD) or from the <title rend="italic">Wiener
            Zeitung</title> (WZ) will be quoted with their date of publication and page number.</note>)</p> <p> <hi rend="italic">PERSON</hi> <hi rend="italic">OCCUPATION</hi> <hi rend="italic">PLACE</hi> </p> <p> <hi rend="italic">CAUSE-OF-DEATH</hi> <hi rend="italic">AGE</hi> </p> </item>
        </list>
        <p>The categories derived from the text were color-coded (cf. legend above; <ptr target="#jaenickeetal2015"/>) and,
          in combination with annotated examples, documented in the form of annotation guidelines as intersubjectively
          applicable and concise as possible. These guidelines were then used as concrete aids for decision-making by two
          researchers familiar with the historic material to annotate a randomly drawn and temporally distributed sample of
          500 death list entries in the browser-based environment Prodigy (<ref target="https://prodi.gy/">https://prodi.gy</ref>). The software provides annotators with a graphic user interface, where they are shown one
          item at a time accompanied by the pre-defined tagset:</p>
        <figure xml:id="figure03">
          <head>Screenshot of the annotation of an exemplary item in Prodigy</head>
          <figDesc>Screenshot from the software Prodigy where the user interface shows the tagset, an annotated death list
            item and the options to accept, decline, skip or return to the prior item</figDesc>
          <graphic url="resources/images/figure03.png"/>
        </figure>
        <p>Annotations are made by first choosing a tag through clicking on it and then marking one or multiple words to
          which the tag should be assigned. In case of errors or re-decisions, markings can be easily deleted and redone.
          Furthermore, Prodigy allows for unclear items to be omitted and for multiple users to (re-)annotate the same
          dataset.</p>
        <p>During this annotation process, the emphasis was put especially on emerging <q>challenging</q> cases, i.e. items
          where annotators were in doubt about their choice of category, the exact positioning of annotations or the
          necessity to annotate certain text segments at all. Whenever annotators encountered such ambiguous items, these
          were collected, grouped and – as a third step in the annotation process – discussed within the interdisciplinary
          team of philologists, historians and prosopographers. Within this collective, a solution for each group of issues
          was agreed on and incorporated into the annotation guidelines. As a consequence, existing categories were revised
          where necessary. The new, more stable and mature category system was then again used for a new sequence of
          annotation and discussion of ambiguities, resulting in an iterative process where annotation and category
          development became intertwined. This approach roughly corresponds to Rapp’s <ptr target="#rapp2017" loc="pp. 256–257"/> basic notion of an annotation process, which she breaks down into the following five steps: it
          involves an initial exploratory data analysis, an initial definition of categories and formulation of guidelines,
          the annotation itself, an evaluation, and the repetition of these steps. Concrete findings that emerged through
          this process are discussed in the following sections on the basis of sample items. </p>
        <div>
          <head>PERSON</head>
          <p>Since each death list item documents one person that died in- or outside the city of Vienna, the tag PERSON can
            be considered fundamental for the annotation task. It refers to information identifying the individual whose
            death is detailed, specifically, their first and/or last name, as given in (2): </p>
          <list type="simple">
            <item> (2) <hi rend="italic">Carl Richter / Burgerl. Schuh=macher / bey dem golden Lammel / auf der Wieden / alt
              44. J. </hi>(WD 21.06.1730: 8)</item>
          </list>
          <p>However, not every death list entry follows the prototypical pattern of [first name] + [last name] given in (2)
            which provides annotators with a clear conception of where the PERSON tag should start and end. Instead, items
            can also, among other things, involve maternal names (cf. 3), additional titles (cf. 4), and even unnamed persons
            (cf. 5). In order to facilitate later disambiguation and to distinguish items with unknown persons from items
            missing an annotation tag, we decided to also subsume such (as well as similar) cases of additional identity
            information under the PERSON tag:</p>
          <list type="simple">
            <item> (3) <hi rend="italic">Dem Hern Augustin von Damian, Käyserl. Wasser=Ambts Gegenhandler / beym rothen Thurn
              in seim Hauß aussers rothen Hoff / sein Frau Anna gebohrne von Hoffmann; ist am Schlag=Fluß beschaut / alt 46.
              Jahr</hi>. (WD 08.08.1703: 8)</item>
          </list>
          <list type="simple">
            <item> (4) <hi rend="italic">Die (Titl) Fräulein Maria Sibilla Stögerin / von und zu Ladendorff / im Graff
              Herbersteinischen Hauß am alten Kühn=Marckt / alt 82. Jahr</hi>. (WD 06.02.1706: 9)</item>
          </list>
          <list type="simple">
            <item> (5) <hi rend="italic">Eine unbek. Weibspers. alt b. 56 J. ist in d. Donau ertrunken gefunden worden.</hi>
              (WZ 04.06.1796: 13)</item>
          </list>
          <p>Nevertheless, not all issues encountered when annotating could be solved solely by widening (or narrowing) the
            scope of the PERSON category. For instance, as example (3) has already depicted, one death list entry might
            contain references to more than one (named) person: As women (e.g. <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">Walburga</foreign></hi> in 6) and children (e.g. <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">Joseph</foreign></hi>
            in 7) were considered less autonomous than men, no separate entry is recorded under their name; rather, they are
            identifiable by the mention of their husband (cf. <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">Karl
            Wesselly</foreign></hi> in 6) or father (e.g. <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">Friedrich
            Eysenhut</foreign></hi> in 7):</p>
          <list type="simple">
            <item> (6) <hi rend="italic">Dem Karl Wesselly, bürgl. Schneiderm. s. W. Walburga, alt 39 J. b. St. Ruprecht N.
              473. </hi>(08.07.1786: 10)</item>
          </list>
          <list type="simple">
            <item> (7) <hi rend="italic">Dem Friedrich Eysenhut / Burgerlichen Schneider im Pendenriederischen Hauß beym
              Bischoff=Hof / sein Kind Joseph / alt 1. Jahr.</hi> (19.11.1703: 8)</item>
          </list>
          <p>It might be argued that one could simply use the sequence of person entities in each item to discriminate the
            related (first named) from the deceased person (second named). However, not all items that include two or more
            persons necessarily express a kinship or partnership relation. The entry shown in (8), for example, accumulates
            three deceased persons whose only (known) connection is their same place of death, namely the city hospital:</p>
          <list type="simple">
            <item> (8) <hi rend="italic">Lorentz Gräz / alt 25. Jahr : Mich. Gassenthaler / alt 21. Jahr : und Rosina
              Schinnaglin / alt 73. Jahr : alle 3. im dem Kranken=Haus.</hi> (WD 13.03.1732: 7)</item>
          </list>
          <p>Due to such cases as well as the high frequency of items involving more than one person, an adjustment of the
            initial tagset was deemed necessary: instead of assigning the overarching tag PERSON to all (un-)named persons,
            the category was split into two separate tags, namely PERSON-DECEASED and PERSON-RELATED. Although this
            conceptualisation is currently sufficient for our research interests, further sub-categories are certainly
            possible. For instance, depending on the respective purpose, one could additionally distinguish between first,
            second and last name, or between maternal and married name. </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <head>OCCUPATION</head>
          <p>Another type of personal information included in (almost) all death list entries is occupational information.
            Here, in contrast to the previous category, no additional distinction between the occupation of a deceased person
            and the occupation of a relative/spouse needs to be made since given occupation titles generally refer to male
            persons:<note> In very rare cases, an occupation is also attributed to women, but in this case no male person is
            part of the respective item.</note> </p>
          <list type="simple">
            <item> (9) <hi rend="italic">Joh. Wurm, gew. Wirth, alt 36. J.</hi> [...] <hi rend="italic">im spanisch. Spit.
              Mil. Zimm. </hi>(WD 20.05.1772: 8)</item>
          </list>
          <list type="simple">
            <item> (10) <hi rend="italic">Dem Frantz Dietz / burgerl. Fleisch=hackern / s. Tochter Maria Anna / in seinem h.
              an der Wien / alt 16. J. </hi>(WD 14.07.1734: 7)</item>
          </list>
          <p>In (9) the deceased himself is an innkeeper (<hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">Wirth</foreign></hi>),
            while in (10) it is the father of the deceased child whose profession (<hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">burgerl. Fleisch=hacker</foreign></hi> <q>civic butcher</q>) is mentioned by name. The same principle applies to
            death list entries for married women and partly even widows (e.g. <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">Glasermeist. Witw.</foreign></hi> <q>master glazier’s widow</q>). In this respect, the assignment of OCCUPATION
            entities to PERSON entities does not pose an issue. Rather, the difficulty lies in defining the start and the end
            point of an OCCUPATION tag since, as it can already be seen from the examples above, occupational information
            frequently includes additional attributive adjectives (e.g. <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">burgerl.,
            gew. [gewester]</foreign></hi>). Depending on the semantics of these adjectives, they can either be considered
            central occupational distinctions (e.g. <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">Kayserlicher
            Schneider</foreign></hi> <q>imperial tailor</q> vs. <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">Burgerlicher
            Schneider</foreign></hi> <q>civic tailor</q>) or other descriptive supplements (e.g. <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">gewester</foreign></hi> <q>been</q>).</p>
          <p>As another challenge, various textual elements were discovered that cannot be classified as an occupation, but
            still reveal essential information about a person and his or her role in society (e.g. <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">ohne Condit. [Condition]</foreign></hi> <q>without occupation</q>, <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">Wittwe</foreign></hi> <q>widow</q>, <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">verh.
            [verheiratet]</foreign></hi> <q>married</q>, <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">Kind</foreign></hi>
            <q>child</q>, <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">armes Mensch</foreign></hi> <q>poor person</q>, <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">Töchterl</foreign></hi> <q>daughter</q>, <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">Weib</foreign></hi> <q>wife</q>). To account for this valuable information as well, a new category
            and tag was introduced, namely SOCIAL-ROLE, as annotated in the exemplary items below:</p>
          <list type="simple">
            <item> (11) <hi rend="italic">Der Anna N. ledigem Menschen / in der Roßau / ihr Kind Leopold / alt 9.
              Wochen.</hi> (WD 07.02.1711: 9)</item>
            <item> (12) <hi rend="italic">Jos. Gruber, Armer, zur Meerfräule im Lichtenthal, alt 66. J. </hi>(WD 16.05.1772:
              7)</item>
          </list>
        </div>
        <div>
          <head>PLACE</head>
          <p>While information belonging to the categories OCCUPATION and SOCIAL-ROLE is frequently, but not always present
            in a death list entry, the place of residence and/or death is consistently specified. According to our category
            system, such toponyms – understood as names for identifiable and thus namable parts of the earth’s surface (cf.
            <ptr target="#drager_heuser_prinz2021" loc="p. V"/>) – are to be annotated with the tag PLACE. However, it turned
            out that an even more precise working definition of place names must be available for this purpose. For instance,
            the prototypical item given in (13), where the life and/or death of the guardsman Gregori Korber is located near
            (<hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">bey</foreign></hi>) the house <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">grüne[r] Jäger</foreign></hi> in the urban area of <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">Lerchenfeld</foreign></hi>, already raises several questions:</p>
          <list type="simple">
            <item> (13) <hi rend="italic">Gregori Korber / Guardi=Soldat / bey dem grünen Jäger im Lerchenfeld / alt 41. J.
              </hi>(WD 13.02.1732: 7)</item>
          </list>
          <p>The first thing to ask is which words are specifically part of the toponym to be annotated, i.e. whether to
            include or exclude preceding definite articles from annotation (<hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">dem
            grünen Jäger</foreign></hi> vs. <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">grünen Jäger</foreign></hi>). Here, it
            helps both to compare different texts of the source material with each other and to include further knowledge
            resources: additional list items showcase a frequent merging of preposition and article (e.g. <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">bey dem &gt; beym</foreign></hi>) which makes it impossible to mark only the latter as
            part of the place name, and historical city maps (e.g. Steinhausen 1710) refer to houses without articles when
            listing them in their legend (e.g. <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">gulden Löw, Neue
            Weldt</foreign></hi>). Thus, both approaches provide arguments for not regarding articles as part of
            toponyms.</p>
          <p>Secondly, it must be decided whether one (<hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">grünen Jäger im
            Lerchenfeld</foreign></hi>) or two PLACE tags (<hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">grünen Jäger,
            Lerchenfeld</foreign></hi>) should be placed in item (13). As we based the annotation category on the idea of
            identifying not places but place names, we chose to go with the latter variant. This approach also has the
            advantages that the extracted spatial entities can both be directly compared and/or linked to other resources and
            possible spatial relations are made visible through the presence of multiple PLACE tags within a single item. </p>
          <p>Hence, of the four possible ways to allocate the PLACE tag(s) in (13) which are shown in (14), version (14b) is
            considered the <q>correct</q> way according to our annotation guidelines:</p>
          <list type="simple">
            <item> (14)<list type="simple">
              <item>a)<hi rend="italic"> Gregori Korber / Guardi=Soldat / bey dem grünen Jäger im Lerchenfeld / alt 41.
                J.</hi> </item>
              <item>b) <hi rend="italic">Gregori Korber / Guardi=Soldat / bey dem grünen Jäger im Lerchenfeld / alt 41.
                J.</hi> </item>
              <item>c) <hi rend="italic">Gregori Korber / Guardi=Soldat / bey dem grünen Jäger im Lerchenfeld / alt 41.
                J.</hi> </item>
              <item>d) <hi rend="italic">Gregori Korber / Guardi=Soldat / bey dem grünen Jäger im Lerchenfeld / alt 41.
                J.</hi> </item>
              </list></item>
          </list>
          <p>In addition to this guidance for assigning PLACE tags, further aspects must be taken into account for when
            annotating toponyms. On the one hand, within the death lists, toponyms may appear not only in the form of proper
            names but also as appellatives (e.g. <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">Kranken=Haus</foreign></hi>
            <q>hospital</q>) and, on the other hand, it may be difficult to distinguish between place names and place
            descriptions, as the following item demonstrates:</p>
          <list type="simple">
            <item> (15) <hi rend="italic">Dem Lud. Schieber, Maur. s. W. Anna Ma. wo die Jgfer zum Fenst. aussch. am Alsterb.
              alt 22. J. </hi>(WD 05.03.1768: 6)</item>
          </list>
          <p>Although the phrase <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">wo die Jgfer [Jungfer] zum Fenst. [Fenster] aussch.
            [ausschaut]</foreign></hi> <q>where the spinster looks out of the window</q> gives the impression of a place
            merely being vaguely described instead of precisely located, it is in fact a toponym, namely the name of a
            concrete house. As the Wien Geschichte Wiki (2022), a historical knowledge platform for Vienna, documents, this
            house sign stems from a legend: a girl, who had been looking out for her beloved from the window for many weeks
            during the plague in 1410 and 1411, saw his body in the swollen Alsbach stream flowing past, whereupon she threw
            herself into the stream and drowned.</p>
          <p>Besides such peculiarities of the historical material, the structure of location information also tends to
            change over time, as Fischer <ptr target="#fischer2019" loc="pp. 143–144"/> notes: while early death list items
            usually contained a house, street and/or area name, later entries were often more precise and additionally also
            included a house number. Accordingly, this can be seen as another starting point for potentially refining the
            annotation system for specific research interests in the future: for instance, one might want to distinguish
            between names for different localities (e.g. street, square, district, house) or provide a specific tag for house
            numbers.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <head>CAUSE OF DEATH</head>
          <p>Besides the aspects already discussed, some (esp. early) death lists also contained the cause of death for
            certain persons, which could, among other things, be a disease (cf. 16), an accident (cf. 17) or a crime (cf.
            18):</p>

          </list>
          <p>As indicated by these examples, textual elements that are to be tagged with CAUSE-OF-DEATH can be given in
            various grammatical forms; for instance, both nouns and noun phrases (e.g. <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">innerliche Fäulung</foreign></hi> <q>internal rot</q>, <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">Hectica=Fieber</foreign></hi> <q>Hectica fever</q>) as well as adjectives, verbs and verbal phrases (e.g. <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">erstochen</foreign></hi> <q>stabbed</q>, <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">vom Fenster herunter gefallen</foreign></hi> <q>fallen down from the window</q>) may occur.
            Furthermore, a new agent is introduced in this context, namely an inspecting and/or attesting authority who
            examines the deceased and officially determines the cause of death, like the Royal City Court (<hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">Königl. Stadt=Gericht</foreign></hi>) in (17). Depending on one’s research interests,
            such institutional entities could potentially also be assigned a specific annotation tag in the future. But even
            if this is not the case, the list-internal distinction between causes officially autopsied and others only
            mentioned of death still very much informs the annotation process, as it has proven relevant for list items which
            include both a description of the death situation (cf. underlinings) and the result of a pathological
            examination:</p>

          </list>
          <p>For the sake of clarity and with the prospect of automatic analysis of the annotations, officially autopsied
            causes of death were given precedence over unofficial observations and thus annotated solely when present. Only
            if no official statement concerning the cause of death was provided in a list entry, other (descriptive)
            information about it was marked.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <head>AGE</head>
          <p>Last but not least, each death list item found in the <title rend="italic">Diarium</title> includes the age of
            the deceased person which is to be marked with the tag AGE. An advantage here is that no separation in the sense
            of PERSON-DECEASED and PERSON-RELATED is necessary, as age statements exclusively refer to deceased and never to
            related persons. Nevertheless, challenges still arise in regard to tagging death lists according to the AGE
            category. One is the reappearing question about the limits of what should be annotated; here concretely, whether
            the recurrent measurement <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">Jahr</foreign></hi> <q>year</q> (abbreviated
            as <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">J.</foreign></hi>) should be considered as part of the age
            information and thus be annotated (cf. 21a) or whether it should be excluded as redundant (cf. 21b):</p>
          <list type="simple">
            <item> (21) <hi rend="italic">a) Johann Daupy / ein Lagey im Gräfl. Walsteinischen Hauß in der Herrn Gassen / ist
              an der Lungelsucht beschaut / alt 48. Jahr. (WD 12.08.1703: 8)
              <lb/> b) Johann Daupy / ein Lagey im Gräfl. Walsteinischen Hauß in der Herrn Gassen / ist an der Lungelsucht
              beschaut / alt 48. Jahr. </hi>(WD 12.08.1703: 8)</item>
          </list>
          <p>An answer to this question can be found through further engagement with the textual material: Although first
            glances into the death lists give readers the impression that the age of deceased persons was exclusively counted
            in years, closer looks into the historical texts show that a multitude of age measurements can be attested.
            Besides cases of half years (e.g. <hi rend="italic">2. <foreign xml:lang="de">und ein halb Jahr</foreign></hi>),
            third years (e.g. <hi rend="italic">3. <foreign xml:lang="de">und ein drittel Jahr</foreign></hi>) and quarter
            years (e.g. <hi rend="italic">6. <foreign xml:lang="de">Viertl J.</foreign></hi>), also months (e.g. <hi rend="italic">4. <foreign xml:lang="de">Monat</foreign></hi>), weeks (e.g. <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">4 Wochen</foreign></hi>), days (e.g. <hi rend="italic">9. <foreign xml:lang="de">Tag</foreign></hi>) and even hours (e.g. <hi rend="italic">2. <foreign xml:lang="de">Stund</foreign></hi>) were
            used to quantify the life span of a person.</p>
          <p>For the annotation process, this means that it is of central importance not only to annotate the respective
            numerical age specification, but also to include its verbal unit of measurement. In general, it has proven useful
            to take into account verbal supplementary information when annotating age(s). For instance, another special case
            that needs to be considered are entries where the age of the deceased person seems to have been estimated and is
            thus preceded by <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">bey</foreign></hi>, <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">bei</foreign></hi> or <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">b</foreign>.</hi> <q>close to,
            around, approximately</q>, as in (22) and (23):</p>
          <list type="simple">
            <item> (22) <hi rend="italic">Eine unbekannte Manns=Person / bey der Schlag=Brucken in der Leopold=Stadt / alt
              bey 60. J.</hi> (WD 11.04.1731: 7)</item>
            <item> (23) <hi rend="italic">Ein Unbekanter armer Mann / in der Roßau / alt bey 40. Jahr.</hi> (WD 12.10.1709:
              9) </item>
          </list>
          <p>As demonstrated in the two examples above, we decided to also annotate this lexical marker of age estimation as
            it makes a viable difference for interpreting a person’s age. This decision was confirmed by further quantitative
            and qualitative analyses of the death lists’ age statements (cf. <ptr target="#kirchmair_rastinger2021"/>; <ptr target="#rastinger_kirchmair_resch2022"/>), which showed that the small word <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">bei</foreign></hi> is associated with the socio-demographic characteristics of the deceased:
            especially when documented persons were unknown and/or poor, their age needed to be estimated.</p>

        <head>Possibilities and an exemplary application scenario </head>
        <p>The preceding considerations and reflections on each category document that a reliable annotation of our research
          data is complex and labor-intensive. However, it should be emphasized that the annotation of precisely these
          semi-structured list entries is also a rewarding task: ultimately, the annotations make the inherent structure of
          the texts computer-readable, which in turn can become the starting point for further research. </p>
        <p>An essential function of categorising this data is its deeper classification, which could then be integrated into
          the existing prototype <title rend="italic">DIGITARIUM</title> and in this way enrich the edition. The TEI offers
          extensive coding recommendations that would be applicable in the case of persons and places. Another advantage
          would be the retrievability of already annotated entities, which could then be searched for specifically, as
          frequently wished for by users <ptr target="#fischer2019" loc="pp. 149"/>.</p>
        <p>Also, especially important seems to be the fact that reliably annotated data sets (like the one described) can be
          used as a training set for machine analysis methods. To use the dataset <quote rend="inline">as a gold standard for
          both rule-based and machine learning NER approaches</quote> <ptr target="#jiang_banchs_li2016"/>, was at the same
          time one of the primary intentions of the annotation project described (cf. <ptr target="#resch_rastinger_kirchmair2022"/>). If such approaches prove successful, they can potentially also be
          applied to other similar texts, e.g. the arrival lists of the <title rend="italic">Wien[n]erisches Diarium</title>
          (cf. Rastinger, 2022) or lists in other early modern periodicals.<note> Currently, various NER models that are
          already available for (historical) German are being evaluated in the course of the City of Vienna funded project
          <title rend="quotes">Visiting Vienna – digital approaches to the (semi-)automatic analysis of the arrival lists
          found in the <title rend="italic">Wien[n]erisches Diarium</title></title> (2022–2023, PI: Nina C. Rastinger).
          </note> </p>
        <p>Another important application area that should not be underestimated opens up when thinking about the future of
          annotation: if it is the case that annotation decisions will increasingly also be made by artificial intelligence,
          the definition of sound categories determined and approved by experts takes on a special significance as such
          category systems can increase the probability of valid and consistent annotations. For instance, when using Large
          Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 (<ref target="https://openai.com/gpt-4">https://openai.com/gpt-4</ref>) for NER,
          users are given the possibility to state the labels they would like to use for tagging their texts which then, in
          turn, heavily influences the quality of the output. </p>
        <p>That annotations also enable quantitative analyses <ptr target="#nanni_kuemper_ponzetto2016"/>, and make them more
          transparent, will finally be shown by an exemplary application scenario. From the multitude of categories (name,
          occupation, cause of death etc.), it is the age specifications that are visualized here as they allow for automatic
          extraction over the whole dataset. Before being analyzed on a quantitative level, however, these age specifications
          had to be translated from verbal age expressions to numerical values. Hereby, varying measurements of age (e.g.
          years, quarter years, days), as well as graphematic variation (e.g. <q>quarter years</q> as <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">Vierdtel Jahr</foreign></hi> versus <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">Viertel=Jahr</foreign></hi> versus <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">Viertl J.</foreign></hi>), needed to
          be taken into account. Also, the age expressions could be given in a half-verbal manner which requires high
          historical knowledge, as their conversion to numbers diverges from contemporary expectations multiple times. For
          example, <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">dritthalb Jahr</foreign></hi> <q>three half years</q> must be
          translated to 2.5 (i.e. 3 minus 0.5) years instead of being interpreted as 3.5 (i.e. 3 plus 0.5) years. Through
          such extensive data preparation, the verbal age expressions of 13.084 list items were converted to a numerical form
          and visualized in the graph below, where the age span of the deceased in the death lists ranges from two hours to
          109 years.</p>
        <figure xml:id="figure04">
          <head>Fig. 4: Number of deceased persons per age (in years)</head>
          <figDesc>A bar graph showing the number of deceased persons per age, which is counted in years. The highest spikes
            are given for the ages of one to five years. Also noticeable are the high numbers for the round years, such as
            40, 50, 60 or 70, which are clearly above the years surrounding them.</figDesc>
          <graphic url="resources/images/figure04.png"/>
        </figure>
        <p>As shown in the plot, the child mortality in the 18th century can be considered to be very high and, in reality,
          might have been even higher, as, according to Peller <ptr target="#peller1920" loc="p. 229"/>, stillborn children
          and children in the first year of life are often not included in the death lists. While child deaths seem to be
          very common during this time period, cases of centenarians can be considered to be relatively rare, since only 20
          of them could be observed in our data. What seems to be striking are the spikes at round numbers such as 30, 40 or
          50. This phenomenon is already discussed by an academic in the 18th century, namely by Süßmilch <ptr target="#suessmilch1761" loc="p. 362–363"/>, who clarifies that those spikes must not be interpreted as more people
          dying at a round age, but rather as an artefact of a preference for round ages divisible by ten. Stolberg <ptr target="#stolberg2007" loc="p. 50"/> also links these spikes to socio-cultural circumstances and infers that the
          division of life into decades seems to have determined the subjective experience of the course of life. As this
          exemplary use case highlights, annotations of the death lists can be deployed very fruitfully for the investigation
          of mortality in the 18th century. However, contextual knowledge is very much needed for interpreting the
          results.</p>

      <div>
        <head>Findings and Conclusion</head>
        <p>Based on the examples and the application scenario discussed, it has become clear that the annotation of seemingly
          simple and short list entries can by no means be considered a trivial task. Annotating these texts requires
          specific knowledge and great familiarity with the source, including an overview of the time period and knowledge of
          the early modern newspaper landscape. A hurdle that should not be underestimated arises from the fact that we are
          dealing with a level of language that is remote in time today, and therefore we cannot always rely on our natural
          sense of language and judgment. In addition to the graphematic variation, which was not at all uncommon at the
          time, there are abbreviations that have become increasingly frequent over the course of the century, which make
          text comprehension more difficult and (as in the next example) must be correctly resolved.</p>
        <list type="simple">
          <item> (24) <hi rend="italic">Dem Phil.</hi> [Philip]<hi rend="italic"> Noe, Barb. </hi>[Barbier]<hi rend="italic">
            s. </hi>[sein]<hi rend="italic"> W. </hi>[Weib]<hi rend="italic"> Cath.</hi> [Catharina]<hi rend="italic"> Nro.
            </hi>[Numero] <hi rend="italic">116. nächst der Mariahilferlin.</hi> [Mariahilferlinie]<hi rend="italic"> alt 40.
            J.</hi> [Jahre] (WD 09.06.1773: 8)</item>
        </list>
        <p>In order to understand these abbreviations, not only linguistic-historical knowledge is needed, but also
          topographical knowledge of Vienna in the 18th century – the letter <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">M</foreign></hi>, for example, can stand for <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">Markt</foreign></hi>
          <q>market</q>, <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">"Mühle</foreign></hi> <q>mill</q> or more meanings.<note>
          What has also proven helpful in decoding historical abbreviations so far, has been the creation of an (open-ended)
          register of abbreviations used in the <title rend="italic">Wien[n]erisches Diarium</title>. This is currently
          especially done by Thomas Kirchmair as part of his master thesis in the field of Digital Humanities.</note> In all
          cases of doubt, it is advisable to compare the respective entry with others or to search for similar (complete)
          forms that have already occurred and from which the abbreviations can be derived. For the recognition of
          professions that no longer exist today, the annotators will also need profound historical-cultural knowledge,
          otherwise it can happen that an occupation (such as <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">Viehmayr</foreign></hi> in the following example) is misinterpreted as a personal name.</p>
        <list type="simple">
          <item>(25) <hi rend="italic">Elis. Heimbergerin, Viehmayrs Wit. alt 70 J zu Margareth. N. 26.</hi></item>
        </list>
        <p>In the course of the annotation process and the intensive effort to form tangible categories, it has become
          apparent that our understanding of the death lists and their entities has deepened increasingly. The initial five
          categories soon became insufficient to adequately describe the lists. The expansion of the original five to seven
          descriptive categories, namely PERSON-DECEASED, PERSON-RELATED, OCCUPATION, SOCIAL-ROLE, PLACE, CAUSE-OF-DEATH, and
          AGE, can therefore also be seen as a consequence of a growing comprehension and our competence to make increasingly
          accurate discernments about the texts analysed. If the annotation process is compared to a spiral cycle
          (schematically illustrated in <ptr target="#lemnitzer_zinsmeister2015" loc="p. 103"/>) or to an extended
          hermeneutic circle (cf. <ptr target="#bogeletal2015" loc="p. 124"/>), this annotation cycle can theoretically be
          understood as open-ended.<note> In the course of our paper, we have already discussed several ways in which one
          could potentially further optimize the presented annotation system for one’s own research needs. One last example
          for such future adaptions could also be to distinguish between the social role(s) of a deceased vs. a related
          person.</note> </p>
        <p>With this in mind, it is even more important that tools are developed that support undogmatic annotation and
          provide users with the possibility to modify existing as well as "create" new tags even during the annotation
          process (such as CATMA (<ref target="https://catma.de/">https://catma.de</ref>), MAXQDA (<ref target="https://maxqda.com/">https://maxqda.com</ref>) or Annotation Studio (<ref target="https://www.annotationstudio.org/">https://www.annotationstudio.org</ref>), so that researchers can
          dynamically adapt their tagset when they identify limitations and/or contradictions in their initial assumptions. </p>
        <p>In practice, these open and flexible annotation cycles, where tagsets are never entirely final, are not seldom
          confronted with a project reality whose reporting does not tolerate any postponement or provisionality, but often
          requires quick decisions. It is therefore all the more important to allow sufficient time for annotation processes
          and also to plan for iterative phases of analysis, discussion and evaluation. The experience shows that it is worth
          investing more effort and time in this phase of the investigation, since it is often precisely through this
          continuous critical reflection that new insights into the data material are gained. Last but not least, a reliable
          system of categories with well-considered annotations can spark off a whole new range of questions and ideally has
          the potential to become a springboard for further research. </p>
