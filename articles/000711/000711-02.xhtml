                  <p>Annotating – understood here as the process in which segments of a text are marked
                     as belonging to a defined
                     category [<a class="ref" href="#reiter_willand_gius2020">Reiter, Willand, and Gius 2020</a>] – can be seen as a key technique in many disciplines [<a class="ref" href="#macmullen2005">Macmullen 2005</a>], especially for working with text in the Humanities [e.g. Unsworth 2000], the
                     Computational Sciences (e.g. [<a class="ref" href="#sivasothyetal2021">Sivasothy et al. 2021</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#doleschaletal2022">Doleschal et al. 2022</a>]), and the
                     Digital Humanities [<a class="ref" href="#caria_mathiak2019">Caria and Mathiak 2019</a>]. In the field of Digital Humanities, annotations of text are
                     utilized, among other purposes, for the enrichment of a corpus or digital edition
                     with (linguistic) information
                     (e.g. [<a class="ref" href="#lu2014">Lu 2014</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#nantke_schlupkothen2020">Nantke and Schlupkothen 2020</a>]), for close and distant reading methods
                     (e.g. [<a class="ref" href="#jaenickeetal2015">Jänicke et al. 2015</a>]), or for machine learning techniques (e.g. [<a class="ref" href="#fioruccietal2020">Fiorucci et al. 2020</a>]). Defining categories to shape data has been used in different text analysis contexts,
                     including the study of
                     toponyms (e.g. [<a class="ref" href="#kyriacopoulou2019">Kyriacopoulou 2019</a>]) and biographical data (e.g. [<a class="ref" href="#aprosio_tonelli2015">Aprosio and Tonelli 2015</a>]).</p>
                  
                  <p>The paper at hand showcases the use of annotations within the Vienna Time Machine
                     project (2020-2022, PI: Claudia
                     Resch) which aims to connect different knowledge resources about historical Vienna
                     via Named Entity Recognition
                     (NER). More specifically, it discusses the challenges and potentials of annotating
                     18th century death lists found
                     in the <cite class="title italic">Wien[n]erisches Diarium</cite> or <cite class="title italic">Wiener Zeitung</cite>, an
                     early modern newspaper which was first published in 1703 and has already been (partly)
                     digitized in form of the
                     so-called DIGITARIUM [<a class="ref" href="#resch_kampkaspar2019">Resch and Kampkaspar 2019</a>]: Here, users can access over 330 high-quality full text
                     issues of the newspaper which contain a number of different text types, including
                     articles, advertisements and more
                     structured texts, such as arrival or death lists. The focus of this article lies on
                     the semi-structured death
                     lists, which do not only appear in almost every issue of the historical <cite class="title italic">Wiener
                        Zeitung</cite>, but are also relatively consistent in their structure and display a high semantic
                     density: Each
                     entry contains detailed information about a deceased person, such as their name, occupation,
                     place of death, and
                     age.</p>
                  
                  <p>Annotating these semi-structured list items opens up multiple possibilities: The resulting
                     classified data can be
                     used for efficient distant or scalable reading, quantitative analyses [<a class="ref" href="#nanni_kuemper_ponzetto2016">Nanni, Kümper, and Ponzetto 2016</a>],
                     and as a gold standard for both rule-based and machine learning NER approaches (e.g.
                     [<a class="ref" href="#jiang_banchs_li2016">Jiang, Banchs, and Li 2016</a>]). To reach this goal and as a first step of the annotation process, the project
                     team conducted a close reading of various death lists from multiple decades to identify
                     recurrent linguistic
                     patterns and, based hereon, to develop a first expandable set of categories. This
                     bottom-up approach resulted in
                     five preliminary categories, namely PERSON, OCCUPATION, PLACE, AGE and CAUSE-OF-DEATH,
                     which were color-coded [<a class="ref" href="#jaenickeetal2015">Jänicke et al. 2015</a>] and, accompanied by annotated examples, documented in the form of annotation
                     guidelines as intersubjectively applicable and concise as possible. These guidelines
                     were then used by two
                     researchers familiar with the historic material to annotate a randomly drawn and temporally
                     distributed sample of
                     500 death list entries in the browser-based environment Prodigy (<a href="https://prodi.gy" onclick="window.open('https://prodi.gy'); return false" class="ref">https://prodi.gy</a>). Hereby, the emphasis was put especially on emerging “challenging” cases, i.e.
                     items where annotators were in doubt about their choice of category, the exact positioning
                     of annotations or the
                     necessity to annotate certain text segments at all. Whenever annotators encountered
                     such ambiguous items, these
                     were collected, grouped and – as a third step in the annotation process – discussed
                     with an interdisciplinary group
                     of linguists, historians and prosopographers. Within this collective, a solution for
                     each group of issues was
                     agreed on and incorporated into the annotation guidelines. Also, existing categories
                     were revised where necessary.
                     The new, more stable category system was then again used for a new sequence of annotation
                     and discussion of
                     ambiguities, resulting in an iterative process where annotation and category development
                     became intertwined. This
                     approach, explained in the article in more detail, demonstrates that tagsets are never
                     entirely final, but always
                     depend on particular knowledge interests and data material and that even the annotation
                     of inherently
                     semi-structured lists requires continuous critical reflection and considerable historical
                     and linguistic
                     knowledge.</p>
                  
                  <p>At the same time, it can be exemplified by this work that it is precisely these “challenging” cases which
                     carry a great potential for gaining knowledge and can be considered central to the
                     development of a valid
                     annotation system (cf. [<a class="ref" href="#franken_koch_zinsmeister2020">Franken, Koch, and Zinsmeister 2020</a>]).</p>

                     18th century, it held the undisputed position of being the most important newspaper
                     within the Habsburg Monarchy.

                     format and contained between 8 and 40 pages, with a considerable increase in volume
                     towards the end of the century.

                     instance their name, occupation, place of death, and age. Generally speaking, the
                     process of annotating such
                     entities can be analogue or digital, whereas the latter can again be subdivided in
                     manual, semi-automatic and fully
                     automatic practices. While analogue annotations serve to organize, structure, acquire
                     and pass on knowledge, the
                     digital paradigm exceeds these functions, e.g. allowing for the observation of patterns,
                     further processing of the
                     annotations, as well as the usage of large amounts of data [<a class="ref" href="#rapp2017">Rapp 2017</a>, pp. 254–255]. At the same
                     time, especially when processing larger (historical) amounts of data, it is of central
                     importance that the category
                     formation and annotation process is well-regulated and adheres to clear guidelines.
                     In the special case of death
                     lists in historical newspapers such guidelines as well as a category system itself
                     are first to be developed, as
                     such texts have so far only been considered for individual studies focusing on selected
                     aspects and/or time spans

                     various death lists from multiple decades to identify recurrent linguistic patterns
                     and, based hereon, to develop a
                     first expandable set of categories. This bottom-up approach resulted in five preliminary
                     categories as annotated in Example 1 below:</div>

                     in combination with annotated examples, documented in the form of annotation guidelines
                     as intersubjectively
                     applicable and concise as possible. These guidelines were then used as concrete aids
                     for decision-making by two
                     researchers familiar with the historic material to annotate a randomly drawn and temporally
                     distributed sample of
                     500 death list entries in the browser-based environment Prodigy (<a href="https://prodi.gy/" onclick="window.open('https://prodi.gy/'); return false" class="ref">https://prodi.gy</a>). The software provides annotators with a graphic user interface, where they are
                     shown
                     one item at a time accompanied by the pre-defined tagset:</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p12">Annotations are made by first choosing a tag through clicking on it and then marking
                     one or multiple words to
                     which the tag should be assigned. In case of errors or re-decisions, markings can
                     be easily deleted and redone.
                     Furthermore, Prodigy allows for unclear items to be omitted and for multiple users
                     to (re-)annotate the same
                     dataset.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p13">During this annotation process, the emphasis was put especially on emerging “challenging” cases, i.e. items
                     where annotators were in doubt about their choice of category, the exact positioning
                     of annotations or the
                     necessity to annotate certain text segments at all. Whenever annotators encountered
                     such ambiguous items, these
                     were collected, grouped and – as a third step in the annotation process – discussed
                     within the interdisciplinary
                     team of philologists, historians and prosopographers. Within this collective, a solution
                     for each group of issues
                     was agreed on and incorporated into the annotation guidelines. As a consequence, existing
                     categories were revised
                     where necessary. The new, more stable and mature category system was then again used
                     for a new sequence of
                     annotation and discussion of ambiguities, resulting in an iterative process where
                     annotation and category
                     development became intertwined. This approach roughly corresponds to Rapp’s [<a class="ref" href="#rapp2017">Rapp 2017</a>, pp. 256–257] basic notion of an annotation process, which she breaks down into the following five
                     steps:
                     it involves an initial exploratory data analysis, an initial definition of categories
                     and formulation of
                     guidelines, the annotation itself, an evaluation, and the repetition of these steps.
                     Concrete findings that emerged
                     through this process are discussed in the following sections on the basis of sample
                     items. </div>

                        “civic butcher”) is mentioned by name. The same principle applies to death list entries for married
                        women
                        and partly even widows (e.g. <span class="hi italic"><span class="foreign i">Glasermeist. Witw.</span></span>
                        “master glazier’s widow”). In this respect, the assignment of OCCUPATION entities to PERSON entities does
                        not pose an issue. Rather, the difficulty lies in defining the start and the end point
                        of an OCCUPATION tag
                        since, as it can already be seen from the examples above, occupational information
                        frequently includes additional
                        attributive adjectives (e.g. <span class="hi italic"><span class="foreign i">burgerl., gew. [gewester]</span></span>).
                        Depending on the semantics of these adjectives, they can either be considered central
                        occupational distinctions
                        (e.g. <span class="hi italic"><span class="foreign i">Kayserlicher Schneider</span></span>
                        “imperial tailor” vs. <span class="hi italic"><span class="foreign i">Burgerlicher Schneider</span></span>
                        “civic tailor”) or other descriptive supplements (e.g. <span class="hi italic"><span class="foreign i">gewester</span></span>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p21">As another challenge, various textual elements were discovered that cannot be classified
                        as an occupation, but
                        still reveal essential information about a person and his or her role in society (e.g.
                        <span class="hi italic"><span class="foreign i">ohne Condit. [Condition]</span></span>
                        “without occupation”, <span class="hi italic"><span class="foreign i">Wittwe</span></span>

                        to include further knowledge
                        resources: additional list items showcase a frequent merging of preposition and article
                        (e.g. <span class="hi italic"><span class="foreign i">bey dem → beym</span></span>) which makes it impossible to mark only the latter
                        as part of the place name, and historical city maps (e.g. Steinhausen 1710) refer
                        to houses without articles when
                        listing them in their legend (e.g. <span class="hi italic"><span class="foreign i">gulden Löw, Neue
                              Weldt</span></span>). Thus, both approaches provide arguments for not regarding articles as part of

                        legend: a girl, who had been looking out for her beloved from the window for many
                        weeks during the plague in 1410
                        and 1411, saw his body in the swollen Alsbach stream flowing past, whereupon she threw

                        usually contained a house, street and/or area name, later entries were often more

                        potentially refining the
                        annotation system for specific research interests in the future: for instance, one
                        might want to distinguish
                        between names for different localities (e.g. street, square, district, house) or provide

                     multitude of categories (name,
                     occupation, cause of death etc.), it is the age specifications that are visualized
                     here as they allow for automatic
                     extraction over the whole dataset. Before being analyzed on a quantitative level,
                     however, these age specifications
                     had to be translated from verbal age expressions to numerical values. Hereby, varying
                     measurements of age (e.g.
                     years, quarter years, days), as well as graphematic variation (e.g. “quarter years” as <span class="hi italic"><span class="foreign i">Vierdtel Jahr</span></span> versus <span class="hi italic"><span class="foreign i">Viertel=Jahr</span></span> versus <span class="hi italic"><span class="foreign i">Viertl J.</span></span>), needed
                     to be taken into account. Also, the age expressions could be given in a half-verbal
                     manner which requires high
                     historical knowledge, as their conversion to numbers diverges from contemporary expectations
                     multiple times. For
                     example, <span class="hi italic"><span class="foreign i">dritthalb Jahr</span></span>
                     “three half years” must be translated to 2.5 (i.e. 3 minus 0.5) years instead of being interpreted as
                     3.5
                     (i.e. 3 plus 0.5) years. Through such extensive data preparation, the verbal age expressions
                     of 13.084 list items
                     were converted to a numerical form and visualized in the graph below, where the age

                     be very high and, in reality,
                     might have been even higher, as, according to Peller [<a class="ref" href="#peller1920">Peller 1920</a>, p. 229], stillborn children
                     and children in the first year of life are often not included in the death lists.
                     While child deaths seem to be
                     very common during this time period, cases of centenarians can be considered to be
                     relatively rare, since only 20
                     of them could be observed in our data. What seems to be striking are the spikes at
                     round numbers such as 30, 40 or
                     50. This phenomenon is already discussed by an academic in the 18th century, namely
                     by Süßmilch [<a class="ref" href="#suessmilch1761">Süßmilch 1761</a>, p. 362–363], who clarifies that those spikes must not be interpreted as more
                     people dying at a round age, but rather as an artefact of a preference for round ages
                     divisible by ten. Stolberg
                     [<a class="ref" href="#stolberg2007">Stolberg 2007</a>, p. 50] also links these spikes to socio-cultural circumstances and infers that
                     the division of life into decades seems to have determined the subjective experience
                     of the course of life. As this
                     exemplary use case highlights, annotations of the death lists can be deployed very
                     fruitfully for the investigation
                     of mortality in the 18th century. However, contextual knowledge is very much needed
                     for interpreting the
                     results.</div>

                     that the annotation of seemingly
                     simple and short list entries can by no means be considered a trivial task. Annotating
                     these texts requires
                     specific knowledge and great familiarity with the source, including an overview of
                     the time period and knowledge of
                     the early modern newspaper landscape. A hurdle that should not be underestimated arises
                     from the fact that we are
                     dealing with a level of language that is remote in time today, and therefore we cannot
                     always rely on our natural
                     sense of language and judgment. In addition to the graphematic variation, which was
                     not at all uncommon at the
                     time, there are abbreviations that have become increasingly frequent over the course
                     of the century, which make

                     categories, it has become
                     apparent that our understanding of the death lists and their entities has deepened
                     increasingly. The initial five
                     categories soon became insufficient to adequately describe the lists. The expansion
                     of the original five to seven
                     descriptive categories, namely PERSON-DECEASED, PERSON-RELATED, OCCUPATION, SOCIAL-ROLE,
                     PLACE, CAUSE-OF-DEATH, and
                     AGE, can therefore also be seen as a consequence of a growing comprehension and our
                     competence to make increasingly
                     accurate discernments about the texts analysed. If the annotation process is compared
                     to a spiral cycle
                     (schematically illustrated in [<a class="ref" href="#lemnitzer_zinsmeister2015">Lemnitzer and Zinsmeister 2015</a>, p. 103]) or to an extended
                     hermeneutic circle (cf. [<a class="ref" href="#bogeletal2015">Bögel et al. 2015</a>, p. 124]), this annotation cycle can theoretically be
                     understood as open-ended.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1324">[7]</a>

                     even during the annotation
                     process (such as CATMA (<a href="https://catma.de/" onclick="window.open('https://catma.de/'); return false" class="ref">https://catma.de</a>), MAXQDA (<a href="https://maxqda.com/" onclick="window.open('https://maxqda.com/'); return false" class="ref">https://maxqda.com</a>) or Annotation Studio (<a href="https://www.annotationstudio.org/" onclick="window.open('https://www.annotationstudio.org/'); return false" class="ref">https://www.annotationstudio.org</a>), so that researchers can
                     dynamically adapt their tagset when they identify limitations and/or contradictions
                     in their initial assumptions. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p46">In practice, these open and flexible annotation cycles, where tagsets are never entirely
                     final, are not seldom
                     confronted with a project reality whose reporting does not tolerate any postponement
                     or provisionality, but often
                     requires quick decisions. It is therefore all the more important to allow sufficient
                     time for annotation processes
                     and also to plan for iterative phases of analysis, discussion and evaluation. The
                     experience shows that it is worth
                     investing more effort and time in this phase of the investigation, since it is often
                     precisely through this
                     continuous critical reflection that new insights into the data material are gained.
                     Last but not least, a reliable
                     system of categories with well-considered annotations can spark off a whole new range
                     of questions and ideally has
                     the potential to become a springboard for further research. </div>
