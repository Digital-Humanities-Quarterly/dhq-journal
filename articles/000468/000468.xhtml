                  <p>In this paper I present Claude Lévi-Strauss’s <cite class="title italic">Laboratoire
                        d’anthropologie sociale</cite> (LAS), established in 1960, as a case study of the
                     archaeology of the humanities infrastructure. Building on media archaeology and
                     critical infrastructure studies, I stress the significance of the research
                     infrastructure in the analog humanities and I show how the LAS was organized around
                     the Human Relations Area Files (HRAF), a vast ethnographical pre-electronic
                     repository produced at Yale. The paper looks into how the <cite class="title italic">Files</cite> were mobilized to secure funding and space for Lévi-Strauss’s lab
                     and gain infrastructural advantage (boosted by the <cite class="title italic">Files</cite>’ paper-ness), helping it then to establish its position as “richly
                     endowed.” As I suggest, it might be due to these pragmatic considerations – not
                     recognized as epistemically valid – that the Laboratory has not had any important
                     place in the readings of Lévi-Strauss’s work. The paper also highlights “care
                     work” – taking care of resources and relocations – undertaken by Lévi-Strauss
                     and his collaborators. Finally, examining the rationale and history of the HRAF and
                     looking at its use at the LAS, I demonstrate how the tool was refitted to serve the
                     particular needs and ambitions of the Parisian lab. </p>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">Revisiting a certain chapter in the history of structuralism from the point of view
                     of contemporary digital research in the humanities sounds in no way provocative or
                     controversial. Claude Lévi-Strauss’s structuralism, with its systemic, large-scale
                     view, has already been referred to in the context of digital humanities, as in Alan
                     Liu’s article discussing the backdrop for the DH-fuelled debates on meaning [<a class="ref" href="#liu2013">Liu 2013</a>]. Moreover, there has been some evident interest in structural
                     anthropology’s liaisons with computers (for instance: [<a class="ref" href="#seaver2014">Seaver 2014</a>])
                     and its linkage with cybernetics [<a class="ref" href="#geohegan2011">Geohegan 2011</a>]. As I will show in
                     this paper, it is also by dint of its specific institutional and infrastructural
                     making that the structuralist movement continues to prove compelling for today’s
                     research agenda in the digital humanities. With <cite class="title italic">Laboratoire
                        d’anthropologie sociale</cite> as its main hothouse, Lévi-Straussian anthropology
                     appears to have been an early-adopter of the now increasingly popular idea of the
                     humanities lab.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">This paper uses a case study of Claude Lévi-Strauss’s Laboratory of Social
                     Anthropology, or simply the LAS, officially established at the Collège de France in
                     1960 and still a part of its structure, to gain insights into the significance of
                     infrastructure in the analog humanities laboratory. In order to cast some light on
                     the physical situatedness of the LAS and the pragmatic, entrepreneurial side of its
                     workings, I will discuss how this lab was initially organized around its prominent
                     research apparatus – namely, the Human Relations Area Files, commonly referred to
                     as
                     the <cite class="title italic">Files</cite> or HRAF – and how this instrument was
                     mobilized by Lévi-Strauss to secure funding and space and fulfill the goals as well
                     as scientific ambitions of structural anthropology. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">What exactly were the <cite class="title italic">Files</cite>? In hindsight, they appear
                     to be a vast pre-electronic ethnographical database. Their creators described this
                     instrument as “a collection of primary source materials”
                     as well as a “major data retrieval system”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#lagac%C3%A91974">Lagacé 1974</a>, ix]. HRAF, produced at Yale, served as a repository
                     of selected ethnographic literature, mainly already-published articles and books
                     written in or translated into English, with the aim being to cover all known cultures
                     (or at least a representative sample of them).</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">Each paragraph of a text was annotated and indexed by HRAF analysts using two sets
                     of
                     categories. The first (known as <cite class="title italic">Outline of World
                        Cultures</cite>) was geographical, with each world region, ethnic and cultural
                     group ascribed an individual numeric code. The second (<cite class="title italic">Outline
                        of Cultural Materials</cite>) involved indexing the materials according to
                     subject matter, which ultimately strives to cover all aspects of human existence
                     (from religion, magic, kinship, law and political systems to technology, cuisine and
                     sexual practices, etc.). In each file on a particular culture, the source texts were
                     reproduced both in full, maintaining the original page order, as well as in processed
                     form, thus bearing significant amounts of metadata (on multiple levels), with the
                     pages relating to a particular subject grouped together. Each page of a document also
                     contained a header featuring standard bibliographical information as well as the
                     codes (or notations) signaling, for example, the level of education attained by the
                     author or an assessment of the quality of the source. Also attached was the <cite class="title italic">File Guide</cite> that included information on which other sources
                     relating to a particular culture had also been consulted but not included among the
                     <cite class="title italic">Files</cite>. The name of the HRAF analyst who created the
                     particular text was also given. Examples of sample file pages could be found in [<a class="ref" href="#lagac%C3%A91974">Lagacé 1974</a>] and on the HRAF website.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e225">[1]</a>
                     A glimpse of these multilayered metadata and indexing methods is still offered to
                     some extent by today’s eHRAF online database – here are examples of the HRAF files
                     of

                     serve as a mere imitation of the scientific lab (despite its obvious adjacency to
                     that domain), we assume the following determinants in helping to grasp specificity
                     of
                     this modus: (1) experimenting, (2) collaboration, (3) the significance of the

                     (5) the labile position of the researcher (fluidity of the boundaries between the
                     inside and the outside of the laboratory, and the resulting problem of the humanist’s
                     involvement). In an attempt to revise the image of the laboratory as an institution
                     of strictly natural sciences and to search for deeper discursive layers of this

                     initiatives labelled as laboratories. Little is known, however, about their
                     historical forms. Analysis of them, in a somewhat Foucauldian manner, steers clear
                     of
                     seeking the unequivocal origins of the humanities lab and creating a “linear”
                     history – instead it foregrounds recursion and the element of chance in the process
                     of constituting the humanistic laboratory. Exploring the LAS as one of the
                     prefigurations of the contemporary humanities labs<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e302">[4]</a> and focusing on its “infrastructural advantage”, which
                     will be explicated later on, is intended here as a deliberate media-archaeological
                     move, undermining claims that the observed “laboratorization” of the field is
                     merely a recent and fleeting trend. </div>

                        humanities</em>. I adopt a notion of the analog humanities, aiming to use it in
                     a more rigorous, theory-laden sense rather than simply in a non-methodical,
                     metaphorical way, sometimes signaled by the quotation marks around the term. What
                     I
                     propose is to instill a kind of reflexivity or a retrospective, pre-posterous logic
                     in it (a notion of <em class="term">pre-posterous</em>, pertaining to history and meaning
                     intentional anachronisms, is borrowed from the Dutch art historian Mieke Bal). As
                     Jonathan Sterne argues: 
                     <blockquote>

                           technological, and institutional conditions across the humanities that have
                           only come into clear focus in retrospect. They refer to the cultural and
                           material infrastructures on which humanists depended and still depend.

                     [<a class="ref" href="#sterne2015">Sterne 2015</a>, 19]. One could say that this idea of the analog
                     humanities perfectly embodies the pre-posterous thinking (where “pre-” and
                     “post-” are being playfully reconfigured) since it evolved and actually made

                     to the technological modes of inquiry and to epistemic implications of the academic

                     blurry category denoting everything being pre-digital or not-digital. Elsewhere, in
                     his entry on the analog in the <cite class="title italic">Digital Keywords</cite>, Sterne
                     claims that “we should return some specificity to <em class="term">the

                     [<a class="ref" href="#sterne2016">Sterne 2016</a>, 41] — it is not to denote any natural
                     (pre-technical) state of the world, but rather a certain technology of inscription
                     (or representation). With a background in sound studies and the history of sound
                     recording, Sterne conceives of the analog era as a period dominated by analog
                     technologies reproducing print, sound, video and images, but not erasing any earlier
                     media.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e360">[5]</a> Being rather
                     chronologically specific (although not in a strict way), the notion of analog
                     humanities thus irresistibly seems a periodization concept (which could be deemed
                     problematic).<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e378">[6]</a> Even if we cannot entirely avoid
                     this logic, I would argue that the analog humanities serve here as a term identifying
                     a particular techno-cultural state of scholarship; that is, the role of the word
                     “analog” in this expression is primarily to emphasize mediality of knowledge
                     production in the humanities and not so much to carve out a certain era.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e390">[7]</a>
                     In this way perhaps the <em class="term">analog humanities</em> could still make sense in
                     light of the debates on the post-digital, which, as David M. Berry argues, currently
                     defines our times. Berry and Fagerjord notes that Sterne’s definition of the analog
                     humanities is useful in exploring the links between media and epistemology in the
                     humanities, although “it might overstate the disjuncture between
                     ‘analog’ and ‘digital’”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#berry2017">Berry and Fagerjord 2017</a>].<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e416">[8]</a></div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p9">Therefore, in my paper I follow Sterne – I understand the analog humanities as a
                     concept retrospectively facilitated by the digital humanities, intended to
                     characterize a techno-cultural condition of the earlier scholarship. At the same
                     time, I see the analog humanities not as everything that preceded the digital and
                     post-digital age, but rather as a media ecology of print, index cards, typewriters,
                     sound recordings, transparencies, overhead projectors, copiers and microfiches, etc.,
                     used by the scholars, especially in the second half of the twentieth century, to
                     which my case study points to. If we were to find a vivid and detailed illustration
                     of this, a description of the LAS’s first interior, written by Emmanuelle Loyer, a
                     biographer of Lévi-Strauss, comes to mind:

                     </blockquote> By the “analog humanities
                     lab” I understand the laboratory of the analog humanities or, to make it
                     more pleonastic, the humanities laboratory which emerged from the analog humanities
                     (of which the LAS happens to be an instantiation). The humanities laboratory is seen
                     as a mode of knowing, but certainly in the case of the LAS it also materializes as
                     a
                     research institution under the very label of the lab (and with the physical
                     premises). Lévi-Strauss’s laboratory constitutes a good case to be investigated
                     within the framework I adopt in this paper, but naturally it is not the only example
                     of the analog humanities.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e440">[10]</a></div>

                     installations as well as their human builders and operators, underlying protocols,
                     ideas, or standards. In other words, it highlights both ‘the hard and soft
                     scaffolding’ of research, as named by Shannon Mattern (2016). Furthermore,
                     infrastructure critics and theorists helpfully remind us to study media “with an infrastructural disposition, that is, with questions of
                     resources and distribution in mind”

                     filled with paper files and sent regularly from New Haven, Connecticut to Paris since
                     the beginning of the 1960s. It is this concrete piece of infrastructure that mostly

                     there has in fact been very little exploration and discussion of the significance
                     of
                     the laboratory in relation to Lévi-Strauss’s oeuvre.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e522">[14]</a> What could possibly account for
                     such a surprising marginalization or lack of interest? Together with Małczyński and
                     Wolska I posited that the laboratory idea could either have been forgotten (as a
                     relatively minor element of the structuralist program) or overlooked because of the
                     dominance of anti-laboratory ways of thinking fostered by the interpretive
                     anthropology after the peak of structuralism had passed.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e531">[15]</a> Perhaps it might also be the case
                     that the laboratory has neither been forgotten nor overlooked, but has instead been
                     passed over in silence in light of the pragmatic reasons behind its founding. These
                     very reasons will be revealed as my “infrastructural inversion” unfolds, making
                     a case for the <em class="emph">significance</em> of infrastructure (as one of the
                     hypothetical determinants of the humanities laboratory listed above), understood in
                     a
                     twofold way – as evidenced by the dictionaries, significance could mean both
                     importance, the quality of being worthy of attention and the ability to convey
                     meaning. The latter could be further interpreted within the media studies
                     perspective, asserting that conveying is hardly epistemically neutral and that to
                     convey meaning would be at the same time to shape it. We can rephrase it into a
                     question of how research tools, spatial arrangements and management of resources
                     affect the process of humanistic knowing. </div>

                     prefigures research infrastructure as we know it today – for example a digital
                     repository), but it is also grounded in primary source material – Lévi-Strauss’s own
                     statements show that the <cite class="title italic">Files</cite>, acquired with no little
                     difficulty, were at the heart of the Laboratory’s work. Lévi-Strauss admitted that
                     the HRAF formed the center around which he built the institution and that the role
                     of
                     this research instrument was “comparable to that of the telescope

                     shows is that while grasping infrastructure in the humanities, one is likely to be
                     challenged by its juxtaposition with science.</div>

                     humanistic infrastructure on the sciences, Patrik Svensson puts forward the idea of
                     the humanistiscope, which “is much less laden than the
                     aforementioned devices, although it borrows from a scientific infrastructural
                     logic and the Greek for ‘to look/examine’ (which also points to the

                     assumptions and expectations are deeply entrenched in the very concept of
                     infrastructure, relating it to science and engineering. Interestingly, the HRAF –
                     although it is “just” a paper-based collection of indexed ethnographic reports –
                     falls exactly into this category by being (1) expensive,<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e583">[16]</a>
                     (2) “used beyond single research groups,”<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e591">[17]</a> (3) having “considerable longevity” and (4) “a sense

                     acronym. The HRAF thus constitutes a perfect instantiation of infrastructure tout
                     court. Likewise, it meets the basic criteria of infrastructure proposed by <a href="#star1999">Susan Leigh Star (1999, 381-382)</a>, such as
                     embeddedness in other structures or layers, transparency (unless it breaks) and

                     early as 1958, two years before the Laboratory was formally established. He might
                     have benefitted from his role as secretary general of the International Social
                     Science Council, founded under the auspices of UNESCO (of which he happened to say

                     into possession of the only complete paper copy of the HRAF card index in Europe.
                     As
                     Lévi-Strauss noted, he succeeded in this mission “after many

                     obliged to make the HRAF available to any interested party [<a class="ref" href="#l%C3%A9vistrauss1991">Lévi-Strauss and Eribon 1991</a>, 63]. </div>

                     and using them – the Laboratory gave its own name to the collection – <cite class="title italic">Centre documentaire d'ethnologie comparée</cite>.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e686">[20]</a> The infrastructural
                     advantage of the LAS was of course closely related to prestige and the sense of
                     exclusivity which was in turn – perhaps surprisingly – amplified by a paper
                     technology. It should be said that in 1958 the <cite class="title italic">Files</cite>
                     were introduced in a microfiche format which proved quite efficient – cheaper to
                     ship, more durable and taking up far less space. Still, the paper versions continued
                     to be produced until 1984. Why did Lévi-Strauss’ Laboratory opt for the paper
                     version, given its constant problems with obtaining adequate space (a more detailed
                     account of these difficulties will follow)? After all, subscribing to the paper HRAF
                     was burdensome, involving endless boxes of 5 x 8 inches loose paper slips which had
                     to be carefully filed and properly stored.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e710">[21]</a> Loyer notes that in its
                     second year in the LAS the HRAF already consisted of “about two

                     tons and taking up 18 cubic meters of space”

                     concocted by Lévi-Strauss in his efforts to receive a more comfortable location. What
                     is more, one of the researchers currently working in the LAS drew my attention to
                     the
                     fact that due to the singular rules of succession at the Collége de France, it is
                     more likely for the chair to justify its continued existence when it possesses some
                     expensive specialist equipment (which usually pertained to the natural sciences

                     received full-sized paper copies. Everyone else (the so called microfiles members)

                     headquarters at Yale and twenty-four copies entrusted to the sponsor members) was
                     part of the arrangements made by the HRAF corporation with the publishers holding
                     the
                     copyrights to the ethnographic sources reprinted in the <cite class="title italic">Files</cite> — they agreed on releasing twenty five copies in total (see: <a href="#roe2007">Roe 2007, 64</a>). Expanding the number of
                     subscribers was thus only feasible by changing the medium of publication – apparently
                     microfiches were acceptable as derivative version of paper “originals”, which
                     were ultimately xeroxed copies. As evidenced by a 1970 report by the HRAF president
                     <a href="#ford1970">Clellan Ford (1970,39)</a>, in that period

                     Lévi-Strauss explained that this was the reason behind the Laboratory’s multiple
                     changes of location. The Laboratory’s location for the first five years of its
                     existence was in an annex to the Musée Guimet on Avenue d’Iéna (formerly the private
                     residence of Emile Guimet, it was not necessarily fit to house a research
                     organization). It comprised two rooms, with the largest being almost completely
                     filled by the files, while a smaller one (a reconfigured bathroom with the stumps
                     of
                     pipes protruding from the floor) was shared by several researchers: Lévi-Strauss,
                     Isac Chiva, his collaborator Françoise Flis (Zonabend) and Jean Pouillon, the editor
                     of <cite class="title italic">L’Homme</cite>.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e773">[23]</a>
                     This did not stop Susan Sontag from claiming in her review article “A Hero of our Time”
                     <a href="#sontag1963">(1963)</a> that Lévi-Strauss “heads a
                     large and richly endowed research institute”, much to the bewilderment of
                     Chiva. The reputation enjoyed by the Laboratory and its founder certainly encouraged
                     one to imagine its physical location as something much grander than it was in

                     building’s ceilings to bear. There was also a growing team of over thirty technical
                     and research staff. Space was in short supply. The sound of talking and the noise
                     generated by typewriters made working conditions in the common room difficult, if

                     location as having “an adjoining reading room, two offices for

                     Lévi-Strauss was a lone “hero” (to echo Sontag’s essay title) – in fact, a great
                     deal of care work in the LAS must have been done cooperatively, engaging other
                     academics and staff. This also involved taking care of the HRAF – someone had to
                     unpack, arrange, catalog and maintain the files pouring into the LAS’ library in
                     order to make them available. Throughout the years there have been several people
                     managing the library (Marion Abélès, among others) and additional specialists in

                     without “some secretarial help”

                     LAS’ assistant director and his long-time closest collaborator, Isac Chiva. In a
                     private letter to Chiva dated back to 1976, he admitted: “I have
                     not said that the laboratory helped me directly in my own work, but that I could
                     never have managed to do it if you had not so greatly relieved me of the task of
                     managing that institution,” repeating this praise much later (in 2003) in
                     another letter: “For I would never have embarked on the adventure
                     of the laboratory if I had not known that you were ready to come along with
                     me” (cited in: <a href="#loyer2018">Loyer 2018,
                        387-388</a>). What might be true of any academic center, the LAS could not have
                     flourished if it had not been for a significant load of immaterial work performed
                     by
                     its permanent, apprentice and visiting researchers, by technicians, journal editors,
                     research coordinators, archivists, librarians, and the secretarial personnel. Strauss
                     could have been a central figure crucial for functioning of the lab (often attributed
                     to him as “his” laboratory), but he also thrived on the endeavors undertaken by
                     others. Even if, as his biographer points out, Lévi-Strauss never stopped working
                     on
                     his own, nourishing his “soloist” nature and spending half a day in the

                     driving force behind the whole enterprise. As Rebecca Lemov has noted in her book

                     <a href="#lemov2006">(2006)</a>, Murdock was a Yale professor famous for his
                     encyclopedic knowledge. In 1928, he started constructing a bibliography on the
                     subject of various cultures around the world. After several years working alone, his
                     project transformed into the collective endeavor that became the <cite class="title italic">Cross-Cultural Survey</cite>. From 1935, Murdock’s team operated under the aegis
                     of the Yale Institute of Human Relations, which saw it as suitable for their
                     experimental and comparative social science research. It is particularly notable —
                     and has already been discussed at length (see: <a href="#price2012">Price

                     Second World War. It was then that the project acquired the financial support of the
                     military and US intelligence. It was a valuable operational instrument during the
                     War
                     and also later in Cold War imperialist policy, offering a rich source of systematic
                     data that could easily be misused as intelligence information. Lévi-Strauss was
                     almost certainly aware (at least to some extent) of the rather inglorious backstage
                     of the HRAF development. He noted in interviews that it was created “on behalf of the United States government”

                     hypotheses (constructed on the basis of causal relations between variables) and hence
                     would lead to the generation of a “valid theory in the social and
                     behavioral sciences.” Exemplary questions posed by cross-cultural
                     researchers could be: “Is there an association between most important subsistence

                     rejected by Franz Boas, he did his Ph.D. at Yale, studying under A. G. Keller in the
                     tradition of W. G. Sumner (both associated with the evolutionism to which Boas was
                     rather hostile). However, Lemov concludes that “the files were

                     [<a class="ref" href="#murdock1950">Murdock 1950</a>, 718]. On the other hand, he tended to present the

                     research by taking out “the leg work”, “all the routine unproductive labor” and freeing the

                     information could be searched for in the HRAF catalog. Based on his own empirical
                     testing, i.e. using his own experience, Murdock claimed that using the files meant
                     a
                     text could be written in a little more than 24 hours rather than the 24 days that
                     a
                     standard search through a library would entail [<a class="ref" href="#murdock1950">Murdock 1950</a>, 720]. Perhaps this is what Margaret Mead also had in mind when she criticized the Human

                     instant coffee.”<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e1164">[32]</a> It was
                     both the unusual speed and reliance on second-hand, republished sources (which the

                     targeted here. There is no hiding the fact that using the HRAF might provoke
                     associations with an already at that time outdated “armchair anthropology”.

                     in terms of its scope and ease could have interested Lévi-Strauss, who described
                     himself as a “library man”, not necessarily too keen on prolonged fieldwork
                     (see: <a href="#l%C3%A9vistrauss1991">Lévi-Strauss and Eribon 1991,

                     After all, the laboratory label was chosen by the LAS founder on purpose, and he was
                     aware of the obvious connotations it carried.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e1192">[33]</a> His views on the relations between the

                     oversimplification, one could say that Lévi-Strauss’s mindset was close to a nuanced
                     form of scientism. While speaking about choosing a name for his center, he resorts
                     to
                     etymology, as if he tried to revisit the history of the lab as a strictly science
                     domain, as well as nodding to the “hard” sciences, which he understands as
                     “more advanced”: 
                     <blockquote>
                        <p>Some people
                           were surprised that the term <em class="term">laboratory</em> could be applied to a
                           center for the human sciences. In adopting it, however, we did not follow a
                           fashion nor were misled by appearances. According to the etymology, a
                           laboratory is first of all a place where one works. And it suffices to enter
                           ours to see that the methods of ethnological research today adopt a style that
                           brings them closer to those of more advanced sectors. (cited in:  (<a href="#belmont2008">Belmont 2008, 62</a>))</p>

                     of conducting anthropology “from afar.” According to Lévi-Strauss, “the anthropologist is the astronomer of the social sciences: his
                     task is to discover a meaning for configurations which, owing to their size and
                     remoteness, are very different from those within the observer’s immediate

                     according to Lévi-Strauss himself, some key figures like Raymond Aron, Gabriel Le
                     Bras, Jacques Lacan and Pierre Bourdieu expressed interest in it (cited in: <a href="#loyer2018">Loyer 2018, 385</a>). Also, Simone de Beauvoir was
                     said to consult the HRAF (see: <a href="#salerno2004">Salerno 2004,
                        137</a>). Regarding collaboration fostered by the HRAF, it appears that sharing
                     infrastructure did not necessarily lead to working together.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e1320">[37]</a> The collection was rather used individually by scholars.
                     Referring to an already mentioned account of the spatial constraints imposed on the
                     LAS’s members by the growing HRAF, we can observe that expansion of the <cite class="title italic">Files</cite> led to shrinkage of office space and eventually
                     resulted in adding partition walls, “especially under the Mansard
                     roof, to create individual cubicles”

                     more likely to affect work habits and forms of sociality in the Laboratory
                     (solidifying a perceived need for a solo studio, or a cubicle) rather than transform
                     modes of doing research. Regarding affordances of the <cite class="title italic">Files</cite> coming from their content and organization, they could have lent
                     themselves to analyses undertaken by the LAS’s researchers. Lévi-Strauss talks about
                     collaborating with his colleagues (Lucien Sebag and Jean-Claude Gardin) on the
                     mythology of Pueblos – preparing an inventory, “laying a myth on
                     the table and analyzing it together”

                     “structuralist activity” defined by Roland Barthes as
                     the “fabrication” of the world, which “involves two typical operations: dissection and articulation”

                     expressed inside the LAS, too. Furthermore, it came from the chief expert on
                     informatization, appreciated by Lévi-Strauss, Jean-Claude Gardin (who ran <cite class="title italic">Section d’Automatique documentaire</cite> in CNRS). Gardin is
                     recognized as a pioneer of archaeological computing. As early as in 1960 he published
                     an article reviewing the HRAF in which he points out two main problems of this tool
                     –
                     on a practical level it is too expensive and cumbersome and on a theoretical level
                     it
                     imposes a rigid classification scheme and its categories are too broad to
                     operationalize and lack cross-referencing (see: <a href="#gardin1960">Gardin
                        1960</a>). He also suggests that the HRAF could be opposed because of its
                     aspirations to universality, or the “totalitarianism” of a general system. After
                     a few critical remarks on the HRAF, Gardin elaborates on a different project in the
                     making, undertaken in order to search through vast ethnographic literature by
                     employing mechanical methods. The ethnographer in charge of this task had been
                     Françoise Izard (later known as Héritier), who became Lévi-Strauss’s successor.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p47">Yet another interesting critique that should be addressed here pertains to Murdock
                     and his methods and dates back to 1952. The critic is Lévi-Strauss himself. While
                     acknowledging Murdock’s contribution to the study of social structure by
                     “rejuvenating statistical methods” and “painstaking effort” in creating
                     Cross-Cultural Survey (a.k.a. HRAF), he points out that the number of 250 cultures
                     selected by Murdock as a sample for cross-cultural analyses is an “overindulgent
                     estimate”, data is abstracted and the categories used in the scheme mirrored
                     the traditional evolutionary anthropological theory rather than do justice to terms
                     derived from the source material. It is also to be noted – Lévi-Strauss continues
                     –
                     that the method proves efficient mostly in a negative way (when used to scrutinize
                     whether any alleged correlations are plausible). Finally, he states: “the reader here may easily verify that I take the greatest care to
                     dissociate my conceptions from those of Radcliffe-Brown and Murdock”,
                     adding that he never used statistical methods [<a class="ref" href="#l%C3%A9vistrauss1968">Lévi-Strauss 1968</a>, 306–324]. This is all rather serious methodological and theoretical
                     critique, suggesting unambiguously that Lévi-Strauss was not willing to use the HRAF
                     in the ways intended by Murdock. Perhaps that is why he “reduced” it to a rich
                     bibliographical treasury, intending to repurpose it for his newly opened center as
                     a
                     well-equipped library of literature (in English, so probably less widely available
                     in
                     France). After all, having conducted research in the New York Public Library, he knew
                     how useful it was since he touted this place as the bedrock of his expanded
                     anthropological erudition.</div>

                     up a lot of space, although nobody uses it for research purposes, but a lot of people
                     do like to take photos in front of it. It is reminiscent of the categories coined
                     by
                     Anke te Heesen writing about a type of furniture – the cabinet or cupboard – and its
                     role in making academic knowledge. The author distinguished several subcategories,
                     one of them being <em class="term">Ordungsmöbel</em>, enabling storing and sorting and the
                     other one <em class="term">Representationmöbel</em>, which is for example a decorative old
                     cabinet, usually emptied and put in the rector’s office as a nostalgic representative
                     of the great many years of tradition [<a class="ref" href="#heesen2007">Heesen 2007</a>]. Although HRAF
                     drawers are not empty and materials still can be consulted (by appointment), the

                     the fascinating origins and adventures of the Laboratory. It is worth asking whether
                     structural anthropology might have shared the fate of the HRAF: has it become to some
                     degree a museum piece?</div>

                     to mention Paul Rabinow’s critique of the LAS. As he has noted, despite its
                     significant achievements in fostering a collective mode of research, LAS has not
                     stood the test of time, failing to adapt its methods to changing realities and
                     solidifying a hierarchical structure perpetuated by Lévi-Strauss’ personal charisma

                     colleagues have advocated for anthropological laboratories and have founded one
                     themselves. In their blueprint for the lab, infrastructure is recognized as
                     meaningful, no mimicry of the natural science is intended and the most important role
                     is occupied by “rigorous” concept work (based on collective

                     important role in seeking funds and space and – considered as valuable and rare
                     resources – were used to gain infrastructural advantage (based on their paper-ness)
                     and helped to position the LAS as “richly endowed”. I suggest that it may be
                     partly due to these pragmatic reasons – recognized as not epistemically related or
                     valid – that the Laboratory has not had any important place in the readings of

                     Lévi-Strauss appears to be a skillful administrator, fundraiser, facilitator of
                     teaching and publishing platforms and a vocal advocate for the human sciences
                     (despite the scientism he may have subscribed to). He was able to coordinate the

                     possible implications thereof. I argued that although maintaining this enormous

                     start intensive research collaborations within the lab, which is sometimes believed
                     to result from sharing infrastructure). It could be said that the HRAF used by
                     Strauss and his Laboratory took on various functions, ranging from boosting the sense
                     of excellence and exclusivity, through being a rhetorical tool in discourse on
                     modernization of the human sciences and experimental anthropology, to even being a
                     bargaining chip in negotiation for a bigger locale. In several respects the <cite class="title italic">Files</cite> were compatible with research agenda in the Laboratory
                     of Social Anthropology and with its founder’s own proclivities, constituting a
                     repository of “ready-made experiments” and lending
                     themselves to structuralist “dissection and articulation”. However, it is more
                     likely that <cite class="title italic">Files</cite> in the LAS were actually tailored for
                     its specific (infrastructural) needs and used more traditionally than was intended
                     by
                     their creators – not as a machine for drawing statistical correlations, but rather
                     an
                     efficient library catalog. Through the “infrastructural inversion” it all comes
                     into focus, proving how seemingly prosaic arrangements tend to be epistemically
                     laden. </div>

                     humanities labs (their early forms as well as their infrastructural side) has been
                     shared by several scholars – e.g. Lori Emerson, Jussi Parikka and Darren Wershler
                     in their forthcoming publication <cite class="title italic">The Lab Book: Situated
                        Practices in Media Studies</cite> (the project website: <a href="https://manifold.umn.edu/projects/the-lab-book" onclick="window.open('https://manifold.umn.edu/projects/the-lab-book'); return false" class="ref">https://manifold.umn.edu/projects/the-lab-book</a>) and Steven E.

                     arguments historicizing the current <em class="term">lab fever</em>, which are similar to
                     our assumptions, have also been made by Grant Wythoff <a href="#wythoff2018">(2018)</a>. Other recent works pertaining to the history of the laboratory
                     in the humanities concentrate on the nineteenth century German philological
                     seminars (see: <a href="#spoerhase2019">Spoerhase 2019</a>) and the interwar
                     laboratory operating at the intersection of applied linguistics and acoustics
                     (see: <a href="#tkaczyk2019">Tkaczyk 2019</a>). While the focus of many
                     existing works covering this subject is mostly technical and/or design
                     laboratories of various kinds (media labs, digital humanities labs, fablabs,
                     hacklabs, etc.), our project looks into the cases which would not fall into these
                     categories or may not have been otherwise entangled with media studies or other
                     kindred fields. Thus, the proposed framework of the project, aiming to address the
                     question of the laboratory in the humanistic scholarship conceived more broadly,
                     is complementary to the already mentioned studies. Such a general (and perhaps
                     inescapably vague) conceptualization of the humanities would mean that we have a
                     predilection for an interpretive, qualitative approach, straddling various
                     theoretical and methodological orientations, and we tend to emphasize the
                     humanities’ specificity in regard to the natural and social sciences. However,
                     when looking for the historical instances of the lab we are interested in
                     different disciplines, methods and styles of inquiry – vide this paper discussing
                     the laboratory of structural anthropology which – due to its analytical,
                     anti-historical orientation – could be sometimes contrasted with what is
                     traditionally recognized as humanistic knowledge, especially when one takes into
                     consideration the used nomenclature and national conventions – e.g. distinguishing
                     between the <em class="term">human sciences</em> and the <em class="term">humanities</em>.
                     </span></div>
               <div class="endnote" id="d4e302"><span class="noteRef lang en">[4] It could be rightfully argued
                     that searching for precursors does not fit a style of analyses inspired by Michel
                     Foucault’s archaeology of knowledge with its disregard for genesis, continuity and
                     totalization. Therefore, we should be cautious when conceptualizing the status of
                     the LAS and choosing terminology. As stated in the dictionaries, “precursor”
                     and “forerunner” are by and large used as synonyms, although “precursor”
                     connotes not only something happening or existing before another thing, but also a
                     person or thing paving the way for the other’s future accomplishments. Together
                     with Małczyński and Wolska I opted for “prefiguration”, assuming that – being
                     less common and slightly less burdened with teleological thinking – it would be a
                     safer choice.</span></div>
               <div class="endnote" id="d4e360"><span class="noteRef lang en">[5] The author is not explicit about any dates. We could gather that this
                     period spans across the second half of the nineteenth century and the twentieth
                     century. It would be better, though, not to determine when it definitely ends, as
                     if it gave up to the digital era. Sterne is careful not to draw a line here,
                     stressing that the digital devices operate on the layers of the analog
                     technologies or have analog components. Although we are inclined to contrast the
                     analog with the digital, we could also shift the focus to their points of contact.
                     To further complicate the matter, one shall bear in mind a semantic vagueness of
                     these terms. As evidence by numerous lexicon entries and articles, there are
                     various ways of defining the analog and the digital – some definitions foreground
                     technical conditions (continuity vs discontinuity of the signal), while the others
                     focus more on their cultural and affective attributes (analog being closer to
                     nature and human senses, triggering nostalgia, etc.) or even on a deeper
                     philosophical sense (see: <a href="#buckley2014">Buckley 2014</a>, <a href="#cramer2015">Cramer 2015</a>, <a href="#galloway2014">Galloway

                     worth mentioning that in the literature we can find other terms intended to
                     capture earlier technological conditions of the scholarship, for example
                     <em class="term">print-based humanities</em> (see: <a href="#hayles2012">Hayles

                     print remains essential also in this media environment (and so does paper).</span></div>

                     describe specific historical worlds of experiencing media. As Berry and Dieter
                     state, the post-digital signifies the most recent moment, characterized by “immersive, disorientating experiences of computational
                     infrastructures as they scale up and intensify”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#berry2015">Berry and Dieter 2015</a>]. On the other hand, regarding the present time (and the
                     near future), the authors discourage us from delineating the digital and the
                     non-digital, arguing that such distinctions become nonsensical (as the digital is
                     being seamlessly interwoven in our daily lives).</span></div>

                     presented above is in fact framed in a media archaeological perspective, in which
                     insights of past and often obsolete technologies inform our understanding of the
                     contemporary media age and vice versa. Media archaeology foregrounds the
                     materiality of scholarly work, revisiting old and purportedly discarded
                     technologies of intellectual labour (such as the HRAF in both paper and
                     microfiches form) and avoids viewing technological change in terms of imminent
                     progress. The proposed archaeology of the humanities infrastructure also alludes
                     to a Foucauldian sense of <em class="term">archaeology</em>, repurposed by media scholars
                     (e.g. F. Kittler), and seen here as an analysis of the (techno-cultural)
                     conditions of knowledge. Media archaeology does not form a unified field or
                     discipline, being perhaps rather a style or aesthetics of the historical
                     reflection on media and cultural techniques (for a synthesizing account see: <a href="#parikka2012">Parikka 2012</a>). The most stimulating for my thinking
                     have been works and ideas by Lori Emerson, Errki Huhtamo, Markus Krajewski, Jussi
                     Parikka, and Siegfried Zielinski.</span></div>

                     infrastructure studies have been growing, as evidenced by an extensive
                     bibliography curated by Alan Liu, which can be found online: <a href="https://cistudies.org/critical-infrastructures-bibliography/" onclick="window.open('https://cistudies.org/critical-infrastructures-bibliography/'); return false" class="ref">https://cistudies.org/critical-infrastructures-bibliography/</a>. Critical
                     infrastructure studies encompass many different approaches to infrastructure
                     (informed by the science and technology studies, ethnography, media studies,
                     digital humanities, art and design, etc.). They also seem to include a narrower
                     field of studies dealing with research infrastructure or – even more precisely,
                     humanities infrastructure, seen as a more domain-specific type of infrastructure,
                     devoted specifically to enable research and used within the scholarly communities.
                     Different, yet overlapping, terms exist in the literature – namely: research
                     infrastructure (see: <a href="#anderson2013">Anderson 2013</a>), knowledge
                     infrastructure (see: <a href="#bowker2017">Bowker 2017</a>), scholarly
                     (information) infrastructure (see: <a href="#borgman2007">Borgman 2007</a>),
                     academic infrastructure (preferred by Svensson as the one carrying fewer
                     connotations with science – see: <a href="#svensson2016">Svensson 2016</a>).
                     I find it fruitful not to reduce the complexity evidenced by this rich terminology
                     and mesh together the insights coming from these different approaches. As far as
                     the humanities are concerned, although it could be useful to grasp specificity of
                     specialized facilities, tools, resources, institutions and standards supporting
                     research in the humanities, in some cases we may as well resort to a more generic
                     understanding of infrastructure (bearing in mind that research infrastructures
                     tend to be layered upon or entangled with other kinds of substrates). Svensson
                     also argues for a rather broad understanding: “With an
                     inclusive definition of research infrastructure, almost anything needed to
                     carry out research in the humanities could be included: ranging from paper,
                     pens, books, furniture and people to database structures, grid computing
                     facilities, visualization centers and libraries”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#svensson2011">Svensson 2011</a>]. Additionally, it will be discussed further in the
                     paper that the HRAF is in fact illustrative of the porous boundaries between the
                     concept of research infrastructure associated with science and engineering (and
                     often understood as infrastructure tout court) and the humanities

                     Electronics which Strauss was familiar with and even engaged in some cooperation.
                     As documented in his letters to Jakobson, in the early 1950s Lévi-Strauss sought
                     funding in the US to open in France a center for structuralist analysis
                     undergirded by cybernetics. As discussed by Geoghegan and Loyer, it is not

                     Lévi-Strauss, with his nose in papers – asking a question (of a rather rhetorical
                     nature) if Strauss was actually “lost in the pages of Human

                     would be that he probably wasn’t or at least he would not have seen it as reading
                     the HRAF, but instead the ethnographic reports deposited there.</span></div>

                     did not result in co-authored publications. Speaking of collective work,
                     Lévi-Strauss pointed to his seminar: “our weekly seminar can
                     become the meeting place for a team whose members, already united by other
                     ties, can thus keep each other informed of their individual work. It goes
                     without saying that this collaboration supposes a certain unity of views,
                     without, however, excluding a doctrinal independence. The unity results from
                     the fact that whether to get inspiration or to combat them, the participants
                     readily take as terms of reference the ideas that we, ourselves, continue to
                     develop in both our lectures at the Collège and the discussions - often very
                     lively - which occupy the last part of each seminar”

                     would be of value. I would just like to point to Joseph Tobin’s interesting piece
                     “The HRAF as Radical Text?” (1990), which is a truly
                     tongue-in-cheek interpretation of the <cite class="title italic">Files</cite> as
                     reactionary in a political and also epistemological sense, but stylistically
                     radical. Tobin shows that in the course of the interpretive turn in anthropology
                     (after <cite class="title italic">Writing Culture</cite>), HRAF was dismissed as
                     uncool, dull and falsely scientific. But even before there were considerable
                     objections to it voiced by British anthropologists. Tobin argues it shows a
                     transatlantic rift between visions of how anthropological theory should be built.
                     What was artless “tabulated nonsense” for Edmund Leach
                     (Cambridge), remains a valid behavioral sciences theory created by analyzing
                     causal relationships between variables for his American colleagues using
                     Cross-Cultural Survey and disapproving British anthropology for being “overwhelmingly humanistic”, descriptive and intuitive
                     (cited in: <a href="#tobin1990">Tobin 1990, 478</a>).</span></div>

                     Contemporary (LAC). A striking resemblance to the LAS is most certainly
                     unintentional here, but the idea provokes us to think of the similarities and
                     dissimilarities between the two endeavors. What is worth mentioning, Rabinow’s
                     drive to the “laboratory of the interpretive human sciences” comes from
                     dissatisfaction with the individual project as the dominant mode of knowledge
                     production. </span></div>

                        36-37</a> and <a href="#l%C3%A9vistrauss1965b">Lévi-Strauss 1965b</a>. Also,
                     Loyer writes that since 1967 the LAS could share an SDS 9300 computer with a
                     nuclear physics laboratory at the Collége (she also claims that the LAS was marked
                     by a rather naïve enthusiasm for computers) [<a class="ref" href="#loyer2018">Loyer 2018</a>, 401].
                     This allows us to say that the computer in Lévi-Straussian thinking was not just
                     imagined, as Seaver claims [<a class="ref" href="#seaver2014">Seaver 2014</a>], but actually quite
