                <p>In this essay, we trace our early and ongoing development in creating a digital
                    critical edition of J. Hector St. Jean de Crèvecoeur’s <title rend="italic"
                        >Letters from an American Farmer</title>. We discuss our shift from print to
                    digital publishing technologies and outline the challenges and lessons learned
                    as two senior faculty members starting out in the digital humanities. The essay
                    not only addresses our process in developing the digital edition but also our
                    various experiences piloting the edition with our students. In several brief
                    case studies, we analyze the value of integrating print vs. digital mediums into
                    the classroom as well as our efforts to transfer editorial control over to our
                    students, using the digital to teach them how to become curators of text.</p>

                <p>During a 2011 Northeast Modern Language Association (NeMLA) panel dedicated to
                    the works of eighteenth-century French-American author J. Hector St. John de
                    Crèvecoeur, panelists and attendees participated in an engaged discussion
                    regarding the rewards and challenges of teaching Crèvecoeur to 21st-century
                    college students. Among the biggest challenges discussed, audience members noted
                    the surprising lack of available teaching editions of Crèvecoeur’s most
                    celebrated work, <title rend="italic">Letters from an American Farmer</title>.
                    American literature anthologies, for example, typically include only small
                    sections of <title rend="italic">Letters</title> as a way to introduce students
                    to the style and subject matter of Crèvecoeur’s text. Trade publishers such as
                    Dover, Penguin Classics, and Oxford Classics have published complete editions of
                    the text, but — with their lack of limited (if any) annotations and other
                    supplementary aids for textual, historical, cultural, or critical
                    interpretations — these editions are not ideal for classroom use and have not
                    been published with educators and students in mind.<note>Since this time,
                        Harvard University Press has published (2013) a scholarly edition of <title
                            rend="italic">Letters from an American Farmer</title> (accompanied by
                        thirteen additional Crèvecoeur pieces), edited and compiled by Dennis D.
                        Moore. While the edition has provided an important addition to Crèvecoeur
                        scholarship, as it was written for and marketed almost exclusively towards
                        academics and does not include ancillary teaching materials (e.g.
                        annotations, additional primary and secondary sources, and contextual
                        frameworks), the text was still not the type of traditional teaching edition
                        we refer to here.</note> Given the literary and cultural significance yet
                    textual complexity of Crèvecoeur’s narrative, panel attendants remarked, there
                    was a decisive need for a teaching edition of <title rend="italic"
                        >Letters</title>.</p>
                <p>Since meeting as presenters on this NeMLA panel, we have teamed up to try to
                    identify a workable solution to what we saw as a challenge to professors of
                    early American literature: finding a way to allow faculty to more fully
                    integrate Crèvecoeur’s <title rend="italic">Letters</title> into the college
                    classroom. This article will outline our pedagogical concerns with current print
                    editions of Crèvecoeur’s work (and other early American texts); lessons learned
                    from our early research on alternative digital critical models; our attempts as
                    faculty to begin to develop and create a digital critical edition of <title
                        rend="italic">Letters</title>; our experiences using this digital edition in
                    the classroom; and the broader implications for the growth of digital editions
                    of early American (and other) texts. Finally, we will discuss an initially
                    unanticipated shift in our project: transferring the editorial responsibilities
                    over to our students and teaching them to curate the text themselves as a way to
                    help them become active readers, to deepen their engagement with material, to
                    educate them about the editorial process, and to move them towards the
                    professional.</p>

                <head>Context</head>
                <p>Crèvecoeur’s <title rend="italic">Letters from an American Farmer</title> is a
                    complex, comprehensive canonical American text studied across disciplines,
                    including English, History, and Political Science. What makes the text so well
                    suited for classroom discussion at all levels are the questions it raises about
                    American identity and utopian idealism, as well as the rich and varied ways it
                    does so. In asking that now famous question, <quote rend="inline">What then is
                        the American, this new man?</quote>, Crèvecoeur’s <title rend="italic"
                        >Letters</title> became the first and most important text to openly examine
                    early American identity, culture, politics, and social structures (Letter III).
                    The narrative seeks to address all facets of American colonial life on the eve
                    of the American Revolution. Caught between a utopian view of the colonies shaped
                    by Enlightenment thinking and the growing chaos and conflict around him, the
                    narrator simultaneously highlights both early idealism and disillusionment in
                    the American project. In the process, he touches on fundamental issues that were
                    prevalent in late eighteenth-century America and are still of critical
                    significance today: immigration, commerce, the frontier, the environment,
                    Indigenous populations, the transatlantic slave trade, and disparate class
                    structures. In addition to its approach to important social and historical
                    issues, the text — as an epistolary novel that skirts the boundaries between
                    fiction, history, and autobiography — poses fundamental questions about literary
                    form itself. <title rend="italic">Letters</title> offers students, teachers, and
                    scholars alike a critical lens through which to examine American history,
                    politics, culture, literature, and language.</p>
                <p>Despite the popularity of, the importance of, and the classroom opportunities
                    provided by Crèvecoeur’s text, it is difficult for students to access and
                    interpret for a number of reasons. The late-eighteenth-century language is
                    challenging in its own right. The question of the text’s genre is also
                    convoluted: <title rend="italic">Letters</title> is an epistolary narrative
                    comprised of twelve letters written by a fictional character, an Orange County
                    New York farmer James, to a British subject named Mr. F.B., describing — as
                    James says — <quote rend="inline">our American modes of farming, our manners,
                        and peculiar customs</quote> (Letter I). Although Crèvecoeur himself was
                    French born and only immigrated to America in the late 1750s, he shares enough
                    qualities with James — as a farmer, living in Orange County New York, struggling
                    to navigate the tenuous socio-historical dynamics of rural life on the cusp of
                    the American Revolution — that the text ultimately blurs the boundaries between
                    autobiography, non-fictional prose, and the novel. The ambiguous genre often
                    makes it difficult for students to ascertain the distance between the author and
                    the narrator. This distance is further complicated by sudden narrative shifts
                    between and even within letters, where, for example, notes or brief histories
                    from James or even from another writer are occasionally inserted into the
                    narrative. Finally, and most importantly, the narrative itself is engrained in
                    the socio-historical background of the late Colonial period in America as well
                    as the complex philosophy of the Enlightenment (and, arguably, the ultimate
                    breakdown of that philosophy) and, as such, includes references to various
                    eighteenth-century subjects — botany, farming, hunting, whaling, slavery,
                    Indigenous culture, religion — that often elude twenty-first century
                    readers.</p>
                <p> To fill the gap left by anthologies that publish fragments of <title
                        rend="italic">Letters</title> — but fail to illustrate the complexities of
                    genre, the development of the narrative, the narrator’s emerging story, as well
                    as its radically shifting tone — and trade editions that publish the complete
                    text — but lack the necessary detailed annotations and developed ancillary
                    materials to make sense of the context — we set out to publish a print critical
                    edition of the complete text, replete with those necessary supplementary reading
                    materials. We reached out to a couple of publishers, such as Norton and
                    Broadview, who specialize in critical editions particularly developed for and
                    marketed towards the college classroom. We received interest in our initial
                    inquiries and requests for more developed proposals, but ultimately the
                    consensus seemed to be that — although a teaching edition of <title
                        rend="italic">Letters</title> was, indeed, both timely and valuable — given
                    the trade editions currently available, the market could not accommodate another
                    print edition.</p>

                <head>Exploring a Digital Edition — from the Theoretical to the Practical</head>
                <p> Because of the limited print publishing options and the growing rise in the
                    digital market, we decided to shift course and research digital publishing
                    possibilities. As we did, we quickly realized that, while more challenging, the
                    digital might provide a better opportunity to achieve our primary goal: to make
                    Crèvecoeur’s text not only available but also accessible to the twenty-first
                    century student. Given the very intertextual nature of Crèvecoeur’s writing, a
                    digital approach to his work began to make the most sense, particularly for
                    today’s students. Not only are twenty-first century students woefully uninformed
                    about much of the history and culture of early America but they are also not
                    inclined to do research (even using an online dictionary) to look up
                    information. Unfortunately, printed footnotes are not especially useful either,
                    since most students tend to skip them: today’s students are used to having
                    information at their fingertips — and lots of it. The elements of Crèvecoeur
                    that students, especially non-English or History majors, often tend to find dull
                    (the sections on botany and whaling, for instance) could now be made visual and
                    relevant to, almost tactile for, the contemporary reader. In addition, as an
                    open-source edition, this new format would speak to potential print edition
                    market concerns, would expand open access to early American literature for
                    students and other readers alike, would allow us to engage in the growing field
                    of the digital humanities, and could eventually provide the opportunity to
                    further develop our project to include other early American texts. In general,
                    an online edition would allow us to make use of current developments in
                    technology that would maximize the learning potential for readers and open up
                    the textual world of early America to those outside academia.</p>
                <p> While the digital option was compelling, it created a number of immediate
                    challenges. The most self-evident obstacle was that, while both of us had
                    various levels of expertise and experience utilizing technology in the
                    classroom, neither of us at the time could claim to be <soCalled>digital
                        humanists.</soCalled> In essence, we <soCalled>fell into</soCalled> the
                    digital humanities. Rather than a conscious dive into the digital — its
                    practical applications, its theoretical underpinnings, and the nuances of its
                    scholarship — we were led there, essentially as a publishing refuge when we
                    realized that the analog could no longer accommodate what we had initially hoped
                    to produce. Not only were we not coders, but to cross over into the digital we
                    would have to begin, largely as novices, to investigate whether there were any
                    publishing platforms that could accommodate our Platonic ideal of this edition;
                    and then we would have to consider the theoretical implications of this
                    publishing paradigm shift, implications that we could not then even fully
                    anticipate. Although this circuitous route toward the digital humanities is no
                    doubt far more typical in academia, this alternate perspective — the attempt to
                    penetrate the digital humanities after years of producing more traditional
                    scholarship — is not readily reflected in DH scholarship. Matthew K. Gold and
                    Laura F. Klein’s 2012, 2016, and 2019 <title rend="italic">Debates in the
                        Digital Humaities</title>, for example, each presents a near exhaustive
                    approach to the <soCalled>debates</soCalled> in the digital humanities —
                    defining, theorizing, critiquing, teaching, and envisioning the future of DH (in
                    the 2012 edition, for example) — but by and large each edition still focuses on
                    those who already understand the terms of the debate. In what follows, we hope
                    to add to the rich discussion of the digital humanities by offering a slightly
                    different perspective: a process that involved familiarizing ourselves with
                    foundational digital humanities scholarship, exploring relevant digital
                    platforms, and engaging with other digital humanities projects and pedagogies to
                    begin to carve a space for our digital edition. In short, we hope to share our
                    occasionally painful, frequently tortuous and challenging, but also deeply
                    rewarding process of <soCalled>going digital.</soCalled></p>
                <p> The first step in switching our perspective from the print to the digital was
                    confronting new theoretical questions, including critical and pedagogical issues
                    that were not evident when our goal was simply to make a print critical edition
                    of <title rend="italic">Letters from an American Farmer</title>. For one thing,
                    the existence of and increasing emphasis on digital texts over their print
                    counterparts has raised, and continues to raise, questions about the very nature
                    of scholarship, criticism, and textuality as well as how these elements
                    intersect. In their <title rend="quotes">Introduction</title> to <title
                        rend="italic">Text Editing, Print and the Digital World</title>, Marilyn
                    Deegan and Kathryn Sutherland provide an overview of some of these critical
                    issues. For example, can the standards and methods used to create print texts
                    also be considered valid when creating digital editions, and how does the nature
                    of the text impact the way it is read and used? In short, they observe, <quote
                        rend="inline">Our ideas of what constitutes a literary work are under
                        revision: what factors determine its boundaries and shape, what we mean by

                    <ptr target="#deegan2009"/>. The questions that guided their 2009 volume in many
                    ways remain at the heart of debates over digital editions today; we had to
                    consider several of these questions as we began to investigate digital
                    options.</p>
                <p>The most important and immediate question we had to confront was the one about
                    form: what exactly did we mean when we said we were compiling a <quote
                        rend="inline">digital <q>critical edition</q></quote>? In <title
                        rend="italic">Digital Scholarly Editing: Theories, Models and
                        Methods</title>, Elena Pierazzo, referencing the work of Edward Vanhoutte,
                    observes that <quote rend="inline">a great theoretical effort has been deployed
                        in order to distinguish digital archives from digital editions and
                        documentary editions from critical editions</quote>
                    <ptr target="#pierazzo2015"/>. Our first task was to tease out these
                    differences. We had in mind the Norton editions as a generally accepted and
                    respected model of a print <soCalled>critical edition</soCalled>: a text with an
                    approved version of the text; annotations that explain terms, concepts, and
                    references to help guide the reader; documents that set the text in its
                    historical and cultural context; scholarly articles that introduce the reader to
                    the critical conversation taking place around the text over time; and a
                    bibliography.</p>
                <p>When translating this model of a critical edition to the digital, we generally
                    subscribed to the type of ideal digital model Peter Shilingsburg outlines in
                        <title rend="quotes">How Literary Works Exist: Convenient Scholarly
                        Editions</title>: <cit>
                        <quote rend="block">The scholarly electronic edition of the future…will be
                            convenient: it will be as cheap as a paperback book, with a

                            notes, and the ability to annotate… In order to avoid the down sides of
                            paperback books, the electronic edition must give accurate access to
                            representations (images) of specific historical forms of the text and
                            specific critical editions of the text and to the ancillary materials
                            that contextualized the texts at the time of origin and the times of
                            reception that we care about. It would be even more convenient if the

                    </cit> While we wanted to make all of these digital materials
                        <soCalled>convenient</soCalled> and <soCalled>at hand</soCalled> for the
                    reader <ptr target="#shillingsburg2009"/>, we were also cognizant of the tension
                    regarding the digital that Jessica Pressman and Lisa Swanstrom cogently
                    articulate in <title rend="quotes">The Literary And/As the Digital
                        Humanities,</title> specifically the tension between data/information and
                    interpretation in DH. We wanted to utilize the digital to provide that critical
                    information for readers (annotations, ancillary materials, accumulation of
                    scholarship) but simultaneously prevent the digital from turning readers into
                    passive recipients of knowledge. In order to ensure that these technological
                    tools would be used to help readers become engaged participants, to make sure,
                    in the words of Pressman and Swanstrom, <quote rend="inline">literary critics
                        don’t take data at its word,</quote> we wanted to incorporate interactive

                    commentary <ptr target="#pressman2013"/>.</p>
                <p>Most importantly, however, we agreed with Patrick Sahle’s definition in <title
                        rend="quotes">What is a Scholarly Digital Edition?</title> that <quote
                        rend="inline">a digitized edition is not a digital edition</quote>
                    <ptr target="#sahle2016"/>. We did not want to create a digitized facsimile of
                    an analog edition. Rather, we wanted to take the work that digital archive
                    projects such as <title rend="italic">Project Gutenberg</title> had done and
                    make these unedited digital texts not only available but <emph>accessible</emph>
                    to students. Acknowledging that we would not be able to create that
                        <soCalled>ideal</soCalled> edition of the future that Shillingsburg
                    outlines, we aimed to approximate a version of it. Our initial plan was to
                    create a digital edition of Crèvecoeur’s <title rend="italic">Letters</title>
                    that would include critical annotations as well as links to appropriate
                    supplemental materials as hypertext; students would be able to move their cursor
                    over or click on a word to locate definitions, reading questions, historical and
                    cultural references, videos, and hyperlinks to relevant web sites. We wanted to
                    create an interactive experience for the reader that included the kinds of
                    dynamic features Sahle uses to define digital editions: <quote rend="inline"
                        >browsing paths,</quote>
                    <quote rend="inline">real hyperlinks,</quote> and <quote rend="inline"
                        >integrated technical tools</quote>
                    <ptr target="#sahle2016"/>.</p>
                <p> While critics such as Sahle stop short of distinguishing between a
                        <emph>critical</emph> and scholarly edition, our goal was to move beyond
                    form and also to distinguish our digital critical edition of <title
                        rend="italic">Letters</title> from a <emph>scholarly</emph> edition that
                    focused primarily on textual criticism. Dennis D. Moore has published several
                    collections of Crèvecoeur’s writing that pay careful attention to textual
                    sources and composition and are critical for academic scholarship. We hoped to
                    take on the work that Kathryn Sutherland claims has been deemed less glamorous:
                    the kind of textual annotation that is <quote rend="inline">most in favour with
                        student readers, general readers and commercially minded publishers, to all
                        of whom it is perceived as adding value</quote>
                    <ptr target="#sutherland2009"/>. And perhaps this was one place where digital
                    editions could start to differ from their analog counterparts: that they take
                    seriously the place of textual annotations and the readers who value them. At
                    the same time, we were concerned with maintaining the accuracy of the edition
                    and demonstrating that this type of innovative and interactive digital edition
                    could be as viable and reliable as the more traditional printed one we had hoped
                    to create at the outset. This is why we were careful about the edition of <title
                        rend="italic">Letters</title> we chose to use and about creating that
                    edition ourselves, not depending on another digital edition already in
                    existence, although there are several. We ultimately chose the 1783 Thomas
                    Davies London edition of <title rend="italic">Letters</title> as the most
                    authoritative, and transcribed the text from a digital facsimile of the original
                    into a .doc file to ensure its accuracy. In addition, any minimal emendations
                    that were made would be noted in the edition. The focus would be on editing the
                    apparatus over the text, but at the same time we wanted to ensure textual
                    precision.</p>
                <p> Beyond the theoretical underpinnings, the challenges we faced were also quite
                    practical: while we have both used technology in various forms for our teaching
                    (such as learning management systems, presentation tools, group communication
                    tools) and recognize its pedagogical potential in the classroom, neither one of
                    us had extensive experience with digital publishing platforms. Furthermore,
                    neither of us knew or was prepared to learn website-building languages such as
                    HTML, CSS, or Javascript. Given our own technological limitations, we began to
                    explore what types of digital critical editions had already been published
                    online, either early American or other literary texts. This research would give
                    us a general sense of the scope of similar existing and ongoing digital
                    projects, specifically critical editions geared towards college-level classroom
                    use; it would allow us to ascertain the technologies that might have been used
                    to create such projects (as well as provide us with valuable contacts); and it
                    would provide us with a better visual sense of the parameters for our project —
                    the kind of architectural, stylistic, and pedagogical opportunities, as well as
                    the boundaries such various technologies might afford us.</p>
                <p> What surprised us initially was not how many but rather how few digital critical
                    editions we were initially able to locate easily and readily online, and in
                    particular how few online editions we found with interactive, digitized
                    annotations and hyperlinks, new textual models constructed with the contemporary
                    student in mind. Extensive and invaluable progress has clearly been made in
                    recent decades in the digital humanities. Well-known digital archives, such as
                        <title rend="italic">Project Gutenberg</title> and the Internet Archive,
                    have done immeasurable work digitizing texts and making them available online
                    for teaching and scholarship purposes, but the purpose of these important
                    projects has been primarily to archive these texts rather than to annotate or
                    edit them. More recently, smaller non-profit projects have contributed critical
                    work in this area. <title rend="italic">Just Teach One</title>, sponsored by
                        <title rend="italic">Commonplace: The Journal of Early American
                    Life</title>, is one example of a digital recovery project that is more
                    specifically suited for the classroom, as it not only offers digital
                    transcriptions of texts (in this case <quote rend="inline">neglected or
                        forgotten</quote> early American texts) but also annotates and edits them.
                    While <title rend="italic">Just Teach One</title> and projects like it provide
                    editions with a basic apparatus, they are still not <soCalled>digital critical
                        editions</soCalled> in the sense that they are digitized PDFs, which is to
                    say that they do not offer those <quote rend="inline">integrated technical
                        tools</quote> Sahle characterizes as an essential part of such digital
                    editions <ptr target="#sahle2016"/>.</p>
                <p>Many other digital projects are working on that same important process of
                    recovery and/or preservation but also offer various levels of dynamic
                    integration with those critical <title rend="quotes">technical tools.</title>
                    Other sites, such as <title rend="italic">Digital Library of Medieval
                        Manuscripts</title> and <title rend="italic">American Transcendentalism
                        Web</title>, as well as single-author archival projects, such as the <title
                        rend="italic">Willa Cather Archive</title>, <title rend="italic">The Walt
                        Whitman Archive</title>, <title rend="italic">Jane Austen
                        Manuscripts</title>, <title rend="italic">Digital Thoreau</title>, and
                        <title rend="italic">The William Blake Archive</title>, are representative
                    of the type of digital textual scholarship and digital reading experiences being
                    created online. Each of these sites offers distinctive digital models with
                    unique features particularly valuable for those starting out in the digital
                    humanities. For example, <title rend="italic">Internet Shakespeare</title>
                    offers the ancillary material (an Introduction, Critical Survey, Bibliography,
                    etc…) fundamental to a critical edition, various versions of each text, and the
                    type of digitally-integrated annotations we planned to include. <title
                        rend="italic">The William Blake Archive</title> integrates multimedia to
                    recreate exhibitions of Blake’s work. <title rend="italic">Digital
                        Thoreau</title> makes manifest a <soCalled>fluid text</soCalled> edition of
                    the seven existing manuscript versions of <title rend="italic">Walden</title>.
                    While each of these sites, and the majority of those we examined, tend to be
                    geared towards micro-literary communities, we did identify other
                    interdisciplinary projects, such as <title rend="italic">The Vault at Pfaff’s:
                        An Archive of Art and Literature by the Bohemians of Antebellum New
                        York</title>, sponsored by Lehigh University, which provide a cornucopia of
                    primary and secondary sources, a digital arcade of hyperlinked sources, but
                    which are focused on a very limited theme, in this case the fascinating 1860s
                    New York City bohemian world of Charles Pfaff’s Manhattan beer cellar. Finally,
                    we discovered some for-profit digital publishers, such as Touch Press, which
                    work with publishers to create digital content; Touch Press's version of T.S.
                    Eliot’s <title rend="italic">The Wasteland</title> includes notes, various audio
                    recordings, and critical and dramatic interpretations of the poem.</p>
                <p>Each of these projects was valuable in helping us to conceive of possibilities
                    within the framework of digital publishing; we did, however, learn two valuable,
                    interrelated lessons in our initial investigation. First, the sites we found
                    most readily tended to be geared to scholarly rather than critical editions of
                    work. <title rend="italic">Digital Thoreau</title>, for instance, is more
                    thoroughly focused on what Kathryn Sutherland calls <quote rend="inline">the
                        establishment of the text, its variants and transmission history</quote> as
                    opposed to the interdisciplinary, multimedia critical edition we hoped to
                    create. As discussed, scholarly editions of Crèvecoeur’s <title rend="italic"
                        >Letters of an American Farmer</title> currently exist, and we were not
                    looking to create another. Rather we sought to create an open-source digital
                    edition for the student for whom those unmediated, scholarly print editions were
                    intimidating and difficult to penetrate. In short, although the sites we found
                    were helpful in showcasing the array of options the digital might provide
                    (integrated multimedia, interactive comment tools, hyperlinked annotations), the
                    projects were far larger in scope (e.g. exhaustive single-author archives) and
                    seemed framed with a different audience in mind.</p>
                <p>The most important lesson we learned from this hands-on, primary research,
                    however, was not what we found but rather how hard the material itself was to
                    find. We were struck by the fact that these projects were not catalogued
                    anywhere; instead, they seemed to float in separate silos rather than being
                    gathered together in a single or even several classified repositories. To find a
                    print critical edition, one can search on Amazon or ask a local book seller; to
                    find a digital critical edition, one either needs to be a scholar in a specific
                    literary field or have some similar entry point. There are online directories,
                    such as the Omeka Directory and the Open Access Directory, which gather all
                    types of digital sites and projects, but they do not specifically identify
                    critical editions as such. By contrast, we had hoped to locate a repository of
                    digital editions much in the same way one can go to <title rend="italic">Project
                        Gutenberg</title> to locate a collection of unedited electronic texts.</p>
                <p>Thus, in addition to the challenges already named, we soon realized that if we
                    were to move to the digital, one of our challenges would be to figure out how to
                    make our open-source edition available to those beyond our own students. If
                    well-resourced projects such as <title rend="italic">Internet Shakespeare
                        Editions or Jane Austen Manuscripts</title> were not immediately evident to
                    us as professors of English and newly-inquiring digital humanists, how could we
                    ensure that our edition would ultimately be generally available to students and
                    other educators alike? We began to recognize that we would also need to navigate
                    the important issue of a repository, a digital cooperative where readers could
                    go to access the edition itself as well as other digital critical editions being
                    done in the shadows. As a result, our search for an appropriate platform
                    expanded to include one that could serve as a repository while also being
                    readily available to others.</p>
                <p> Initially, we had hoped to find an online press or nonprofit scholarly platform
                    that was developing these types of digital critical editions and might be able
                    to share information on emerging technologies appropriate to creating such an
                    edition and potentially even hosting the Crèvecoeur edition we planned to
                    produce. Although we failed to find that source in our early research, we
                    discovered a promising publishing platform called <title rend="quotes"
                        >Scalar</title> when we attended a workshop entitled <title rend="quotes"
                        >Critical DH (Digital Humanities) Interventions in Scholarly Communications
                        and Publishing</title> at the 2015 Modern Language Association (MLA)
                    Convention in Vancouver, Canada. Scalar describes itself as <quote rend="inline"
                        >a free, open source authoring and publishing platform that’s designed to
                        make it easy for authors to write long-form, born-digital scholarship
                        online. Scalar enables users to assemble media from multiple sources and
                        juxtapose them with their own writing in a variety of ways, with minimal
                        technical expertise required</quote>
                    <ptr target="#scalar"/>. We had some basic concerns with the publishing
                    platform, specifically that we would be constructing this edition using a
                    technological infrastructure that was uniquely built by Scalar and housed by the
                    Alliance for Networking Visual Culture. Once we designed the edition within the
                    framework of Scalar’s platform, we would not be able to move it. Should its
                    funding source fail or should we find a more appropriate platform, we would have
                    to start from scratch. Given the 75,000-word length of <title rend="italic"
                        >Letters</title>, this prospect was daunting.</p>
                <p>That said, in all other respects Scalar was almost exactly the type of platform
                    we were looking for. Like WordPress the program was user-friendly, but unlike
                    WordPress, Scalar was designed by academics for the specific purpose of
                    developing innovative digital online scholarship, and as such each new project
                    was appropriately and reassuringly called a <soCalled>book.</soCalled> The
                    open-source platform had partnered with various humanities centers that
                    permitted its authors to integrate media more seamlessly, and its design allowed
                    for a clean but flexible and varied display of interactive digital features —
                    from basic notes to internal tags and paths to annotated audio or visual images
                    to reader comments. Given that our initial research pointed to ongoing work in
                    the digital humanities and, more specifically, work on digital critical editions
                    that was still quite piecemeal and dispersed, Scalar seemed like an excellent
                    option: the project would be housed on an academic platform whose mission was
                    linked to scholarly work within the field of the digital humanities, and it
                    offered us the technology we needed without the immediate requirement of
                    technical expertise.</p>
                <p> Before committing to Scalar, however, we spent some time looking at other
                    platforms, such as Omeka, an open-source web publishing platform. Two major
                    differences made us realize that Scalar was clearly the better choice. First,
                    Scalar describes itself as a platform for those who want to publish <quote
                        rend="inline">book-length works</quote>
                    <ptr target="#scalar"/>, and Omeka specializes in hosting <quote rend="inline"
                        >digital collections and…media-rich online exhibits</quote>
                    <ptr target="#omeka"/>; since we were focused on creating a book-length work,
                    Scalar was ideal in this regard. Second, the free Omeka Classic version requires
                    users to have an external server to host their material, while Scalar offers a
                    server as part of their platform. In short, Scalar is self-contained and free,
                    and for those who are beginning in the digital humanities, this makes it a more
                    user-friendly option. Finally, however, and most importantly, we didn’t really
                    find Scalar; Scalar in essence came to us. For two academics who <soCalled>fell
                        into</soCalled> the digital humanities and had a specific project in mind,
                    being able to engage with Scalar at an MLA workshop, hands-on, with other
                    academics, and having access to Scalar representatives with whom we could keep
                    in touch to ask specific technological and strategic questions, this platform
                    was clearly the right place to start.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <head>Creating a Digital Edition</head>
                <p>Once we had identified a suitable platform and began to build the edition, some
                    strategic questions related to annotations and hyperlinks became apparent. The
                    issue of hyperlink <soCalled>stability</soCalled> is, of course, one that is
                    repeatedly discussed when developing online materials. For example, in <title
                        rend="quotes">URLs Link Rot: Implications for Electronic Publishing,</title>
                    a study of articles published by Emerald Publishers between 2008 and 2012, D.
                    Vinay Kumar, B. T. Sampath Kumar, and D. R. Parameshwarappa <quote rend="inline"
                        >found that 48.53 per cent of URL citations were not accessible and the
                        remaining 51.47 per cent of URL citations were still accessible</quote>
                    <ptr target="#kumar2015"/>. A related issue involves open-source accessibility.
                    We had decided to use the <title rend="italic">Oxford English Dictionary
                        (OED)</title> as our source for annotated definitions; we not only wanted to
                    offer contextually-appropriate eighteenth-century definitions but also to
                    include the link to the original online source so that students could peruse the
                    various definitions further as well as other information, such as the word’s
                    pronunciation, etymology, and origin. The problem is that the <title
                        rend="italic">OED</title> requires an account, and we expressly wanted to
                    avoid subscription-based sources and the need to sign in to retrieve annotation
                    links. As a result, we chose the less ideal course: to construct our own
                    definitions and provide a link to the online <title rend="italic"
                        >Merriam-Webster Dictionary</title> for ancillary information. Similar
                    challenges arose regarding historical, philosophical, scientific, and other
                    related hyperlinks. The contextual relevancy, the scholarly value, the factual
                    accuracy, and the stability of the link were of primary importance. More
                    largely, however, we wanted to build a conscious plan about the types of sources
                    we privileged. What open sources would count as scholarly enough? Would the
                    History Channel, for example, be a source academic enough for college-level
                    students? If so, would we want to try to use that source as consistently as
                    possible? Would it be better to locate the most suitable source for any given
                    textual reference, or might the edition then seem like a random hodge podge of
                    hyperlinks without a specific purpose, targeted audience, and directed
                    coherence? This issue was compounded by exactly what had drawn us to this
                    project in the first place: a sufficient number of the references in <title
                        rend="italic">Letters from an American Farmer</title> were abstruse enough
                    not to offer us a wealth of dynamic online reference options.</p>
                <p> There were other challenges as well that involved not only strategy but time:
                    what became immediately evident was that this digital project was going to be
                    far more time consuming than our initial plan to construct a print edition. In
                    addition to struggling through the ins-and-outs of Scalar’s architecture and
                    learning the various facets of its technological possibilities (and
                    limitations), every attempt to insert an annotation, include a hyperlink, or
                    embed media involved several steps and a careful system of organization. Given
                    that Scalar’s infrastructure is not (unlike WordPress, for example) based on
                    hierarchical relationships but has, instead, what it calls a <soCalled>flattened
                        hierarchy</soCalled> (where every <soCalled>node</soCalled> is treated as a
                        <soCalled>page</soCalled> on the same level, and the editor can connect the
                    pages as desired), each new page would need to be given a careful title and
                    description that would allow us to connect it to the text as desired and, as
                    importantly, be able to relocate it as needed later amongst hundreds and (given
                    the length of this text) potentially thousands of other
                        <soCalled>pages.</soCalled> And once a page was created and the annotation
                    or embedded media image or hyperlink was constructed, the page would then need
                    to be internally linked to the appropriate word or phrase in the text itself.
                    The academic and pedagogical process was only a portion of the work; the
                    technological work was also a challenge, and without the help of graduate
                    assistants or the support of grants, the project was going to take more time
                    than we had hoped. More importantly, the question of scalability — which is to
                    say the ability eventually to create other early American teaching editions and
                    to create a repository for such digital editions — would prove daunting without
                    locating other digital humanities partnerships.<note>Although not necessarily
                        within the scope of this discussion, the question of how much academic
                        credit is given to these types of projects towards tenure and promotion is
                        an important one and is directly related to the feasibility of completing
                        such work. If the academy hopes to foster the growth of the digital
                        humanities, particularly these types of open source public projects, we need
                        to consider ways to integrate these projects into a peer-review process to
                        substantiate their academic and pedagogical value and give them credence for
                        tenure and promotion review.</note></p>
                <p> For this reason, we decided to pilot a portion of the project. Before we
                    determined if we were going to dedicate what might be — given our teaching and
                    other research commitments — a year or more of editorial work to finish the
                    whole edition, and before we engraved all twelve letters onto Scalar and became
                    locked into that platform, we chose to complete only a strategic selection of
                    the letters first while simultaneously presenting what we had completed at
                    national conferences and beginning to use this portion of the project in the
                    classroom to start to get feedback from the reader’s perspective. We therefore
                    began working on the four most seminal letters in the text: Letter I, which
                    establishes the narrative context and framework; Letter III, which offers the
                    most salient line and thematic discussion in the text: <quote rend="inline">What
                        then is the American, this new man?</quote>; Letter IX, which addresses the
                    profligate lifestyle of plantation life in Charleston, South Carolina as well as
                    an extended and powerful diatribe on the evils of slavery; and Letter XII, which
                    presents our narrator and protagonist — once steeped in the idealism and reason
                    of Enlightenment doctrine and confident that the American colonies were <quote
                        rend="inline">the most perfect society now existing in the world</quote> —
                    now driven to despair by the chaos and danger of the impending American
                    Revolution (Letter III).</p>
                <p> Although we have made our Scalar digital edition of Crèvecoeur’s <title
                        rend="italic">Letters</title> public for the purposes of limited classroom
                    use, conference presentations, and publications, the edition is very much a work
                    in progress. For that reason, we attach the <soCalled>live</soCalled> link to
                    the digital edition here — <ref
                        target="http://scalar.usc.edu/works/crevecoeur--letters-from-an-american-farmer/index"

                    — with a certain reticence. In his essay <title rend="quotes">The Book, the
                        E-text, and the <q>Work Site,</q></title> Paul Eggert helps to explain this
                    reticence when he discusses the relatively <soCalled>complete</soCalled> nature
                    of a print publication as a <quote rend="inline">unified piece of
                        scholarship</quote> — <quote rend="inline">every part of the volume
                        enlightened by every other part, all of it seamlessly interdependent and
                        unobjectionably cross-referenced, nothing said twice, all of it as near
                        perfectly balanced as you could ever make it</quote> — as opposed to the
                    open-ended, never complete nature of the digital edition, in which errors can be
                    made (or addressed) at any point <ptr target="#eggert2009"/>. For Eggert, the
                    concern is primarily that such lack of closure <quote rend="inline">will prove
                        an opportunity to drop [our] standards</quote>
                    <ptr target="#eggert2009"/>. One might equally point, however, to the anxiety
                    with regards to digital publication of <emph>never</emph> attaining perfection
                    or completion. We are still in the early stages of creating the edition (at
                    minimum, we plan to have Letters I, III, IX, and XII annotated and replete with
                    an Introduction, Emendations, and an extended Bibliography); however, we wanted
                    to make the edition available for public commentary as a way to turn the project
                    into a communal critical and pedagogical venture.</p>
                <p> In many ways, our students have played a foundational role in this communal
                    venture. Initially, our plan was simply to pilot the in-progress edition in our
                    undergraduate and graduate classes in order to get a sense of how students
                    engaged with our edition: to get feedback on their experience reading the online
                    edition versus the traditional Norton print text and also on their experience
                    navigating the various types of annotations and hyperlinks in the Scalar
                    interface. As we began to contemplate how the edition might be made available
                    and accessible for students, and as we began to pilot the edition in class,
                    however, it became clear how students could use Scalar to become active
                    participants in their own editorial work. As Brett Hirsch suggests in <title
                        rend="italic">Digital Humanities Pedagogy</title>, <quote rend="inline">the
                        digital humanities is about learning <emph>by</emph> doing,</quote> and as
                    we ourselves learned by <soCalled>going digital,</soCalled> we wanted to explore
                    how the digital might not only enhance the literary experience for our students
                    but also enhance their own critical thinking experience as well (<ptr
                        target="#hirsch2012"/>, original emphasis). Thus, in what follows, we
                    discuss the various ways in which we have integrated the project into the
                    classroom: first by piloting our edition in the classroom and then increasingly
                    asking our students to partake in textual ownership, by using Scalar to annotate
                    their own versions of <title rend="italic">Letters</title> and then ultimately
                    by using the platform to curate their own texts and create their own digital
                    editions using our edition as a model.</p>

                <head>Using Scalar in the Classroom: Piloting the Edition — Diana H. Polley</head>
                <p> In my Early American Literature class — a 300-level undergraduate course that
                    combined English majors with general education students — at Southern New
                    Hampshire University (SNHU) during fall semester 2017, I had students read
                    versions of Crèvecoeur’s <title rend="italic">Letters from an American
                        Farmer</title> in three different formats: portions of the text from the
                    print Norton edition (which I had assigned for the class), portions of the text
                    from our online edition of <title rend="italic">Letters</title> that had been
                    edited and annotated, and portions of the text from our online edition that had
                    not yet been annotated. I asked for informal feedback, most importantly
                    regarding whether they preferred reading the text online or in print; whether
                    they preferred the online portions that had been annotated or left unannotated;
                    and, more generally, whether they found the digital edition easy or difficult to
                    navigate and whether the annotations and/or hyperlinks were helpful or
                    intrusive.</p>
                <p> Numerous studies have been done examining the effects of reading digitally
                    versus in print, but the results have been far from conclusive. As Ferris Jabr
                    observes in <title rend="quotes">The Reading Brain in the Digital Age,</title>
                    most studies conducted before 1992 <cit>
                        <quote rend="block">concluded that people read slower, less accurately and
                            less comprehensively on screens than on paper. Studies published since
                            the early 1990s, however, have produced more inconsistent results…. And
                            recent surveys suggest that although most people still prefer paper…
                            attitudes are changing as tablets and e-reading technology improve and
                            reading digital books for facts and fun becomes more common. <ptr
                                target="#jabr2013"/></quote>
                    </cit> Interestingly, I noticed that the preference for print over digital in my
                    informal survey was clearly influenced by disciplinary major: it was my English
                    majors who noted a preference for print over online texts, and I attribute this
                    — given my personal knowledge of the English majors at SNHU — to their having
                    grown up in a culture of print books; they tend to be the students who display
                    in multiple ways (several of whom have tattoos of their favorite novels and
                    poems, for example) a deep investment in the traditional culture of the
                    humanities. Just as interesting, however, the majority of my general education
                    students noted a specific preference for the digital and several mentioned the
                    same reason: the prohibitive cost of print books versus the open access nature
                    of digital books. Having required my students to buy the Norton anthology made
                    them particularly aware, as one student said, that <quote rend="inline">books
                        tend to be expensive.</quote></p>
                <p> Another critical question involved the issue of navigating the edition itself.
                    Jabr points to an experience many readers have when trying to recall where they
                    saw something in an analog text as an example of one of the advantages of print
                    books: <quote rend="inline">Both anecdotally and in published studies, people
                        report that when trying to locate a particular piece of written information
                        they often remember where in the text it appeared.</quote> In addition, he
                    notes, <cit>
                        <quote rend="block">An open paperback presents a reader with two clearly
                            defined domains — the left and right pages — and a total of eight
                            corners with which to orient oneself. A reader can focus on a single
                            page of a paper book without losing sight of the whole text: one can see
                            where the book begins and ends and where one page is in relation to
                            those borders… …In contrast, most screens, e-readers, smartphones and
                            tablets interfere with intuitive navigation of a text and inhibit people
                            from mapping the journey in their minds. <ptr target="#jabr2013"
                            /></quote>
                    </cit></p>
                <p>It was for this reason that, in our digital edition, we decided to keep each
                    chapter of <title rend="italic">Letters</title> as a single document, rather
                    than creating separate pages as one would in a book or in trying to mimic an
                    e-book. At its most basic, this allowed students to scroll ahead and see how
                    long the text was and how much more they had to read, something which is not as
                    effective when clicking ahead through numerous, individual pages. This kind of
                    grounding in terms of text length is one way that reading the digital text can
                    be made reminiscent of reading on paper. One can also still orient oneself
                    visually, since for the reader the single <soCalled>page</soCalled> chapter can
                    be similar to a book page; instead of “eight corners with which to orient
                    oneself,” the reader <quote rend="inline">can focus on a single page of a paper
                        book,</quote> even if that page is quite long <ptr target="#jabr2013"/>.
                    While this grounding certainly proved effective with my students, one issue
                    became paramount: without standardized pagination, we had no easy way to locate
                    text for communal discussion in class. Despite the fact that the digital allows
                    for searchability and the textual annotations provide visual landmarks in the
                    text, there were no quick indicators to reference. This experience verified the
                    need for those critical paragraph indicators as a way to maintain a shared sense
                    of orientation, and it became clear that moving forward with the edition we
                    would need to add these visual landmarks.</p>
                <p> Beyond this issue of visual landmarks, one of our main concerns about Scalar was
                    the visible presence of annotations in the form of notecard symbols and
                    highlighted words or phrases, which could prove to be a distraction, snagging
                    the eye and interrupting the reading process. Despite this initial concern,
                    students overwhelmingly found the annotations to be <soCalled>very
                        helpful.</soCalled> They noted that the annotations helped them
                        <soCalled>read faster,</soCalled> provided context and definitions, and
                    allowed them to stay focused. What was interesting, however, was that while
                    students unanimously found the note-type annotations (notes linked directly to
                    the text on the page) beneficial, they were more split on their assessment of
                    the videos and hyperlinks (those links that took them to external pages). Some
                    noted the videos as particularly illuminating while others found them to be
                    distracting, taking them away from the flow of the text; they generally
                    appreciated the videos and hyperlinks and wanted them to be available, but some
                    suggested the links be offered, unlike the annotations, at the end of a section
                    rather than integrated in the middle of the text itself. Interestingly, it
                    seemed that while many students were accustomed to reading texts that contained
                    visible hyperlinks and other signs of authorial
                        <soCalled>interference,</soCalled> picking and choosing what they want to
                    look into as they go along and ignoring the rest, others felt more compelled to
                    engage with each interactive feature, which ultimately diverted them from the
                    flow of the narrative.</p>
                <p> Piloting the edition in class provided a couple of key indicators: it confirmed
                    that the work we were doing on the edition itself was pedagogically valuable,
                    and it offered some important feedback on how to improve the reading experience.
                    What also became clear, however, was that — as valuable as students found the
                    annotations and hyperlinks that we had created for them — the digital benefits
                    of Scalar meant that students could move beyond being just readers of the text.
                    The flip side of the <quote rend="inline">unified piece of scholarship</quote>
                    Eggert notes in print publications is that, with the digital, students could now
                    interact with the text with more ease and explore their roles not just as
                    passive recipients of the text but as interactive interpreters, as curators of
                    the text <ptr target="#eggert2009"/>.</p>

                <head>Editing the Text: Students Create a Communal Version of <title rend="italic"
                        >Letters</title> — Mary M. Balkun</head>
                <p> It was this role of students as <quote rend="inline">interactive interpreters,
                        as curators of the text,</quote> that I chose to explore in my approach to
                    the Crèvecoeur project in two graduate classes in early American literature. The
                    first, in spring 2016, was <title rend="quotes">Hybridity/ies in Early
                        America</title>; the other, in spring 2017, was <title rend="quotes">From
                        New Netherland to New York.</title> In part, I chose a project format that
                    took advantage of the advanced status of these students, but I was also
                    interested in the communal potential of digital texts and seeing how this might
                    be experienced with different groups of students. With a digital text, readers
                    can actively participate in the construction of information, either creating new
                    material or adding to material that already exists. In some cases, readers can
                    edit the existing text (<title rend="italic">Wikipedia</title> is probably the
                    best known example of this), and the platform keeps track of edits so that the
                    text becomes a living history of change and response; other texts allow for
                    commentary alone, but the comments still become part of the user experience for
                    readers. Using Scalar for our edition of <title rend="italic">Letters from an
                        American Farmer</title> meant we actually had multiple options available.
                    New material could be added to an existing text; an existing text could be
                    elaborated upon or commented on; and these elaborations could themselves be
                    edited. The project as I envisioned it would engage students in the creation of
                    their own, communal version of <title rend="italic">Letters</title>, one that
                    would span two different classes, and possibly more in the future.</p>
                <p>Given the advanced skill level of the students, having them actually annotate the
                    text seemed approproiate; however, I did not want students adding annotations
                    directly into our working digital edition of <title rend="italic"
                        >Letters</title>. Fortunately, one of the benefits of Scalar is that it is
                    easy to create additional books from existing material. This meant I could
                    create an independent edition of the text specifically for the students, which
                    would avoid potential problems of having someone accidentally change or remove
                    material from our original edition, or our having to eradicate material
                    afterwards. At the same time, I told the students that at the end of the process
                    I would review their annotations and those of the highest quality could be
                    incorporated into our edition, giving credit in the acknowledgements for their
                    contributions. Since Scalar assigns a number to each editor of a text, it would
                    be easy enough to determine the creator of any of the annotations. Thus, the
                    students were potentially participating in our professional project, doing
                        <soCalled>real world</soCalled> work instead of work simply for a class, and
                    possibly adding to their scholarly credentials. Having students do their own
                    annotations also introduced them to digital humanities skills and a tool,
                    Scalar, that could prove useful for their work later on, especially for those
                    who planned to pursue an advanced degree.</p>
                <p>For the first course in which I included the digital editing project, <title
                        rend="quotes">Hybridity/ies in Early America,</title> I set parameters that
                    would make the work manageable and keep the stakes relatively low, especially
                    since it was my first attempt to have students use Scalar. Each of the students
                    in the course was assigned a 500- to 750-word selection of one of the letters to
                    annotate. I did not specify the exact number of annotations they had to create;
                    instead, they were advised to be as thorough as possible without overwhelming
                    the text with commentary. Because <title rend="italic">Letters</title> was to be
                    the final text in the assigned readings for the semester, we would read their
                    annotated version instead of the print edition I would normally have assigned.
                    Since each assigned segment would vary in terms of the number of annotations
                    that made sense, the students were advised that their work would be assessed on
                    the quality of the information provided and whether essential words, phrases, or
                    concepts had been explained and illustrated. They were also advised to think of
                    their audience as undergraduates as opposed to other graduate students as they
                    made decisions about what to annotate and how to do so. Finally, in another form
                    of communal engagement, I incorporated an in-class peer-review session, which
                    took place the week before we were to start reading their annotated version of
                        <title rend="italic">Letters</title>. Students were paired off to review
                    each other’s work and provide formal feedback: Were the annotations clear? Were
                    they factually and mechanically correct? Did all the links work? Had anything
                    important been left out? Students then had the subsequent week to make
                    revisions.</p>
                <p>In order to prepare the students for the project and give them as much time as
                    possible to complete their annotations, I conducted a Scalar workshop during the
                    second class meeting (we met once each week). During the workshop, each student
                    was asked to annotate the same passage from <title rend="italic"
                    >Letters</title>; we then compared the results to see what each person had
                    decided to annotate, why, and how, so they could see the results of individual
                    editorial choices. In addition to the hands-on workshop, I posted directions for
                    the basic Scalar functions — how to create a notecard, how to create a web link
                    — in the online <soCalled>shell</soCalled> for the course (Seton Hall University
                    uses Blackboard as its learning management system). I started each class session
                    by asking how the project was going and regularly included that question in my
                    weekly email updates to the class. Because they were all working on the same
                    text and with the same digital tool, I found that the students were able to help
                    one another much of the time. I would come to class and one of them would be
                    explaining how to credit a source or how to edit a video with Scalar. Thus, in
                    addition to learning the challenges of textual editing they were also learning
                    to work collaboratively, which is not the norm for literature scholars. In
                    addition to giving the students familiarity with one aspect of the editing
                    process and a useful web tool, my goal was to get them to think outside the box,
                    to use as many different resources as possible in their annotations, and to be
                    creative. They could include any material that would enrich the experience of
                    reading <title rend="italic">Letters</title> for others, but they also had to
                    think about how much they annotated, especially given the potentially crowded
                    viewing field in Scalar, with its notecard symbols and colored hypertext
                    links.</p>
                <p> Besides showing the students how to use Scalar, I had an opportunity to provide
                    them with a professional perspective on scholarly editing. I invited Tiffany
                    Potter, who had edited the University of Toronto print edition of another text
                    we were reading for the course, <title rend="italic">Ponteach, or the Savages of
                        America: A Tragedy</title>, to a Skype interview with the class, which she
                    graciously accepted. The students were able to ask questions about her editing
                    process, about the kinds of challenges she had faced, and about how she had
                    dealt with some of the problems they were facing: how much to annotate, how much
                    to take for granted, and how best to explain complicated matters in a brief
                    space.</p>
                <p> When the time finally arrived to read <title rend="italic">Letters</title> for
                    the course, the students were able to do two things: first, they were able to
                    better understand certain aspects of the text as a result of the annotations and
                    to comment on their efficacy; second, they were able to compare their reading of
                    the annotated as opposed to the unannotated parts of <title rend="italic"
                        >Letters</title> (since they had not annotated the text in its entirety),
                    which led to a productive discussion about the value of annotations and what
                    they added (or not) to the reading process. Having a personal stake in this
                    particular version of the text gave the students an additional investment in the
                    reading and discussion. The project evaluations (I administered a separate one
                    from the regular course evaluation) were uniformly positive. Some students were
                    frustrated with Scalar, as one would expect with any new technology tool, but
                    overall they were able to comment intelligently and even passionately about what
                    it meant to edit a text; most of them agreed that it was something they could
                    see themselves doing again. All of them agreed that they would never look at an
                    edited edition of a text in quite the same way again.</p>
                <p> I incorporated a modified version of this project into a subsequent graduate
                    course in spring 2017, <title rend="quotes">From New Netherland to New
                        York.</title> The primary reason for the changes I made was that I had
                    several students in the class who had taken the prior early American graduate
                    class. In order to provide a different experience for them, in this later course
                    students were given the option to work on one of three different digital
                    projects, with the annotation of <title rend="italic">Letters</title> being one
                    of those. In this iteration I expanded the amount of text to be annotated.
                    Whereas the first class had been asked to annotate only a 500- to 750-word
                    section of <title rend="italic">Letters</title>, each student in the spring 2017
                    course who opted to do the annotation project was given a full letter to edit.
                    However, rather than having this second group of students work on a new,
                        <soCalled>clean</soCalled> version of the text, I had them use the same
                    version of <title rend="italic">Letters</title> that the spring 2016 students
                    had annotated, adding yet another dimension of collaboration. Their first
                    directive was to review the existing annotations made by the students in the
                    previous class and make sure they were factually correct and that all the links
                    worked; they were also required to document any changes they made and to explain
                    the reason for any changes using the Comment function in Scalar.</p>
                <p>Giving students options can increase their investment in the work they are asked
                    to do, and the <title rend="italic">Letters</title> project in the spring 2017
                    course bore this out. The students who opted for this project were exceptionally
                    committed to it and to the quality of the material they added; they were also
                    critical (in the best sense) of the annotations that had already been added by
                    students in the spring 2016 course. This kind of digital text project generates
                    a complex reading community consisting of 1) those who have read the text
                    without being involved in creating the annotations but who have benefitted from
                    the work others have done; 2) those who have commented on the annotations,
                    thereby influencing future editorial decisions; and 3) those who have actually
                    annotated the text. This latter group can then be divided yet again into those
                    who annotate the text at a particular moment in time (i.e. spring 2016 versus
                    spring 2017). Since <title rend="italic">Letters</title> was an edition in
                    progress, students had a chance to think critically about what others had chosen
                    to add to the text, change what was done previously, and then add to it
                    themselves. They thus became curators of the text as opposed to simply readers,
                    and, hopefully, readers with a different relationship to the material. Students
                    involved in this type of project also gain a new awareness of audience, those
                    for whom the annotations are being created, and have to ask of their work: What
                    do those readers need to know? How much information is too much? How can the
                    information best be conveyed? The result is a text that is interactive in the
                    best possible sense. The annotations reflect what students themselves thought it
                    would be useful to know as they and other students read, and it provides
                    information for readers like themselves about terms, historical references, and
                    cultural references. This graduate student edition remains a text that can be
                    added to and updated by other classes, providing a communal experience for
                    future students as well. Most importantly, being able to have students
                    participate in the annotation process gives them a different level of engagement
                    with the text, and it can ultimately — we hope — make them more active
                    participants in a scholarly community. Finally, if their annotations are
                    included in our <soCalled>official</soCalled> online edition of <title
                        rend="italic">Letters</title>, the students can be understood to be
                    participating in an even larger community of readers and helping to
                        <soCalled>author</soCalled> a text that is organic in the way it is shaped
                    and develops over time.</p>

                <head>Curating the Text: Students Create a Digital Critical Edition — Diana H.
                    Polley</head>
                <p>As a result of the various ways in which our students had both used the
                    Crèvecoeur edition and participated in developing new digital content, I was
                    encouraged to consider yet another type of digital exercise as a way to explore
                    the possibilities of digital texts. As I was scheduled to teach an upper-level
                    American Literature Seminar in spring 2018, I decided to use the opportunity to
                    have my students engage in a semester-long project dedicated to constructing
                    their own short digital critical editions using Scalar. I chose not to have
                    students work on Crèvecoeur’s <title rend="italic">Letters from an American
                        Farmer</title> for several reasons. Most importantly, some students in my
                    seminar had taken the Early American Literature course I had taught that
                    previous fall when I piloted the Crèvecoeur digital edition. While the
                    Crèvecoeur edition would prove to be a good model for them, I was concerned that
                    if they were also asked to construct a digital edition of <title rend="italic"
                        >Letters</title>, there would be a temptation to replicate elements of the
                    edition we were producing; I wanted them to enjoy the freedom of a
                            <soCalled><foreign>tabula rasa.</foreign></soCalled> In addition, my
                    students were undergraduates, and I knew that the exercise itself would be
                    particularly challenging. Given the difficulty of Crèvecoeur’s writing, I felt
                    that choosing a more approachable early-American writer — both in form and theme
                    — would be a better option. Therefore, I assigned them, instead, a choice of
                    Benjamin Franklin essays. Over the course of fifteen weeks, my students were
                    asked to incorporate their own selection of key Franklin essays into a digital
                    edition that would include: digital annotations within the text (and related
                    ancillary materials, such as maps, word clouds, videos, etc.); a Note on the
                    Text and list of Emendations; an Introduction; and an Annotated Bibliography.
                    What I realized was how quickly I had to adjust my expectations, not so much in
                    terms of the digital but rather in terms of what my students understood about
                    more traditional concepts associated with the print form (e.g. the critical
                    edition and textual criticism). For example, while I was initially concerned
                    about teaching my students the Scalar platform, I found they picked up the
                    basics with ease. What they struggled with, however, was the very concept of
                    what a critical edition <emph>is</emph>. In an age where raw, unedited literary
                    texts are more readily available online, students seemed totally unfamiliar with
                    the model of the critical edition and the editor’s role in textual production.
                    Even more than the critical edition itself, students were utterly confused by
                    the study of textual criticism. The notion that what they read is not
                    automatically the <soCalled>authoritative text,</soCalled> that there may be
                    versions that are more or less authentic, that an editor may have emended the
                    text, and that as scholars their responsibility is to choose the most valid
                    textual source: all of these ideas seemed foreign to them. When we began working
                    on emendations, one student said: <quote rend="inline">Wait, I’m supposed to
                            <q>edit</q> Benjamin Franklin? I can’t play God. I can’t do
                        this.</quote> After repeated discussions about textual criticism, I was
                    relieved to hear this <soCalled>aha!</soCalled> moment: they were beginning to
                    realize the import of what I was asking them to do.</p>
                <p>Given my students’ confusion and their own uncertainty, asking them to be
                        <soCalled>start-to-finish</soCalled> curators of a digital edition was
                    particularly unnerving. The idea that my students would be using Yale’s Franklin
                    Collection (what we had chosen as the starting point for the
                        <soCalled>authoritative text</soCalled>), and then — as undergraduates —
                    emending, annotating, and digitally <soCalled>publishing</soCalled> that work,
                    highlighted the concerns Eggert notes in comparing print and digital publishing
                    forms and underscores the ease with which texts can be manipulated and endlessly
                    altered online. That said, having my students create their own editions from
                    beginning to end — creating a <title rend="quotes">Note on the Text,</title>
                    emending that text and constructing an <title rend="quotes">Emendations</title>
                    page, including an Introduction, providing annotations and hyperlinks, and
                    offering an Annotated Bibliography — allowed them the chance not only to
                    actively engage with and manipulate the text using the digital but also,
                    ironically, to understand the traditional models associated with the print form.
                    First, they were able to get a sense of the kind of detailed and pain-staking
                    work that goes into textual criticism and, more philosophically, to ask about
                    the ontological relationship between author and editor in the construction of
                    the text. Second, they were able to locate that <quote rend="inline">state of
                        prolonged anxiety</quote> Eggert notes when trying to complete a print
                    edition <ptr target="#eggert2009"/>. This project was not just another college
                    exercise. Their work mattered. And I made clear that because Scalar was an
                        <quote rend="inline">open source online and publishing platform</quote> any
                    edition they constructed for my class they could ultimately make public and even
                    searchable for portfolios and jobs. They would be responsible for the work they
                    produced, beyond the classroom. In many ways, therefore, this digital assignment
                    gave students the opportunity to experience professionalism and the kind of
                    high-stakes perfectionism that Eggert associates with print rather than digital
                        publishing.<note>I am attaching here a link to an edition my student created
                        for the seminar and which is currently <soCalled>published</soCalled>” on

                <head>Conclusion</head>
                <p>Our various experiences with digital critical editions have made us even more
                    convinced of their value, whether for scholarship or for teaching or both. The
                    Crèvecoeur edition has proven beneficial for precisely those reasons we set out
                    to produce it: it would not only make <title rend="italic">Letters from an
                        American Farmer</title> available to students and a larger public audience,
                    but it would, as importantly, make the text <emph>accessible</emph> to that
                    audience. In the process, the digital medium would avoid current cost concerns
                    from the publisher and the buyer associated with the print market and open up
                    new ways for the reader to engage with the text and its context through
                    interactive technological tools.</p>
                <p>As our experience has revealed, however, there are several caveats when it comes
                    to starting a digital edition. For one, an edition needs a repository, a stable
                    place for the text to reside. While we have opted for Scalar, and have
                    confidence that the tool will be functioning for some time to come, there are
                    still risks that a non-profit platform like Scalar might lose its funding or
                    that platform support may be limited. Given this inherent lack of stability, it
                    is important to have a strategy for dealing with changes in tools, platforms,
                    and applications. It also seems critical that, moving forward, more repositories
                    are created for such editions. As discussed earlier, archives do exist, although
                    they seem either to be reserved for a single author (<title rend="italic">The
                        William Blake Archive</title>, for example) or the work of certain editors
                        (<title rend="italic">Just Teach One</title>, for example). No doubt there
                    are some clearinghouses that we simply could not locate. Ideally, however, any
                    repository for such digital editions will be easily located and easily
                    accessible by and for public readership, in much the way that archives for
                    unedited texts currently are, such as <title rend="italic">Project
                        Gutenberg</title> or the <title rend="italic">Full Text Archive</title>. To
                    be effective, we would argue, such repositories should also — by nature — be
                    open-source.</p>
                <p>Of course, the most important lesson we have learned from our own experience
                    creating a digital critical edition is the time it takes to engage in these
                    projects (and, of course, this might account for their limited availability).
                    Beyond helping to define and distinguish the medium, Sahle’s discussion of
                    digitized vs digital editions helps explain the complexity involved in their
                    creation; <soCalled>browsing paths,</soCalled>
                    <soCalled>real hyperlinks,</soCalled> and <soCalled>integrated technical
                        tools</soCalled> all require — for their survival — the interdependence of
                    other <soCalled>real,</soCalled> dynamic paths <ptr target="#sahle2016"/>. The
                    nature of this interdependence means that the initial construction is
                    time-consuming, as is its upkeep. While the original text may remain stable, the
                    apparatus constructed does not and for this reason the result is a digital
                    edition that is forever in flux.</p>
                <p>This flux, what many critics note as its instability, is disconcerting; however,
                    it can also be seen as a pedagogical and scholarly boon. The analog text is
                    certainly more stable. Conversely, that stability comes at a price: it isn’t
                    long before the analog edition becomes outdated, and what was the definitive
                    version — with the most current theoretical essays and contextual material — is
                    now out of step with contemporary and even cutting edge critical thought. The
                    digital critical edition, because it can contain both past and present
                    materials, by contrast, represents a host of perspectives across time. The
                    reader can then see both where the text has been and where it is going, and
                    contribute to those new directions. Thus, while this lack of stability creates
                    fundamental challenges — increased initial time and continued labor and
                    maintenance — its mutability also helps to ensure its continued relevance.</p>
                <p>Finally, what we have found is the inherent communal nature — both for our
                    students and for ourselves — in these types of digital projects. Ideally, the
                    digital edition can reflect various perspectives. It can reflect the current
                    cultural moment, it can retain historical elements, and it can incorporate the
                    work of scholars at various stages in their learning. The edition incorporates,
                    as Sahle says, <quote rend="inline">integrative technical tools</quote> and thus
                    is by its nature integrative; it integrates the perspectives of communities of
                    contexts and communities of scholars <ptr target="#sahle2016"/>. Therefore, it
                    is not only important to consider how much time such a process will take but to
                    find good partners to work with. We were fortunate to have been brought together
                    at that 2011 NeMLA conference, and that our interest and work styles are so
                    similar. Not everyone starting a project will be so lucky. For now, we plan to
                    finish the Crèvecoeur edition, continue to explore future digital humanities
                    pedagogical opportunities with students, and look ahead to possible future
                    collaborative projects, perhaps housed at a site of our own making.</p>
