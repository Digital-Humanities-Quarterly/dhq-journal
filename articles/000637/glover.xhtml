                  focus here on possibility. Like many before me, I began working at the intersection
                  of
                  the humanities and technology from a place of optimistic anticipation. The phrase
                  “the affordances of the digital” tripped lightly over my tongue
                  and the opportunities for differently ordering – for expanding – my intellectual world
                  at first appeared endless. But then, of course (and also like many before me), I quickly
                  came to recognize the perils of wading naively into the waters of DH, the relative
                  ease
                  with which the very hierarchies and exclusions that have long underpinned analog
                  scholarship are reiterated in the digital realm. </div>
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p2">As a researcher in the field of Caribbean studies with particular grounding in
                  francophone literature and culture, my forays into the digital have been largely
                  site-specific. They reflect, accompany, and emerge from the preoccupations that inform
                  my traditional research and teaching – the monographs and articles I have published,
                  the
                  courses I have designed over the last two decades. I have been committed to the
                  persistent unsettling of centers and margins – those that determine the parameters
                  of
                  belonging within the academy as the principal site of knowledge production and
                  circulation, and those that make or deny space along explicitly and implicitly
                  racialized lines. While thinking within this frame has meant contesting the university’s
                  foundational Eurocentricity, I have in fact been most interested in querying the forms
                  of intramural border-drawing that persist within the field of Black studies – notably,
                  the tendency to position of US-American blackness as stand-in for the global Black
                  experience, and the not-unrelated phenomenon of Anglophone monolinguality.</div>
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p3">Thus, when I think about ideal futures for Black studies and the digital humanities,
                  and
                  about the ways I might contribute to crafting those futures, I think primarily from
                  the
                  space of the Afro-Americas. This is certainly not to suggest that shifting focus from
                  the US-American space to the Caribbean archipelago would on its own constitute an
                  ideal.
                  Rather, it is to express my hope that thinking the Caribbean idiosyncratically in
                  my
                  digital work can contribute to widening and nuancing understandings of “blackness”
                  in
                  the hemispheric Americas and beyond. This has entailed relying on Caribbean
                  epistemologies to build digital products: that is, keeping front of mind Martinican
                  writer-intellectual Edouard Glissant’s interconnected term-concepts
                  opacity,
                  Relation, and rhizomatic thinking; Jamaican writer-intellectual Sylvia
                  Wynter’s call to embrace oppositional forms of life – plots that challenge the
                  plantation order; and Barbadian writer-intellectual Kamau Brathwaite's very notion
                  of
                  the archipelago as space of submarine unity – among other modes of
                  thinking community in the shadow of empire, of naming and interrogating phenotypical
                  and
                  class diversity among racialized beings. </div>

               <div class="ptext" id="p4">It has also meant working to develop the mechanisms we need as Caribbeanists in order
                  to
                  be in conversation despite the linguistic and disciplinary silos that in many ways
                  constrain Black participation in the academy. It has meant exploiting the
                  shine of DH to direct resources and to accord deserved prestige to
                  colleagues and communities that are crucial to but rarely enjoy the privileges of

                  communication across the nation-language borders that are the legacies of European

               <div class="ptext" id="p9">I think of these platforms as so many invitations extended to a widely dispersed and
                  unevenly resourced Caribbeanist intellectual community. They are meant to provide
                  sites
                  of exchange less bound by the logistical, bureaucratic, and financial demands of
                  physical displacement. All of these projects have made use where possible of minimal
                  computing, so to be maximally accessible to communities of scholars working outside
                  of
                  well-resourced institutions or in contexts where infrastructural support (electricity,
                  stable internet service) is less reliable. All of them have welcomed contributions
                  from
                  all the languages of the Caribbean. Most recently, we have sought and been awarded
                  significant <a href="https://barnard.edu/news/barnard-college-receives-5m-grant-andrew-w-mellon-foundation" onclick="window.open('https://barnard.edu/news/barnard-college-receives-5m-grant-andrew-w-mellon-foundation'); return false" class="ref">funding</a>, making it possible not only for us to subsidize costs for community
                  members seeking to participate in events involving travel, and to provide translation
                  for our published content and interpretation for our in-person gathering, but also
                  to
                  directly distribute resources through sub-awards to Caribbean institutions and a
                  micro-granting program.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e265">[7]</a>

               <div class="ptext" id="p10">There are, of course, aspects of our Caribbean digital futures that are still hindered
                  by contemporary imperialist realities. The United States remains the magnetic center
                  of
                  the Americas. As such, even the most progressive scholarly pursuits – be they digital
                  or
                  analog – are conditioned by a North Atlantic frame that tends to think blackness,
                  linguistically, in English and, culturally, as a minority identity. If we shift the
                  frame south into the Caribbean and Latin America, however, vastly different expressions
                  and experiences of blackness become legible. Our challenge as Caribbeanist digital
                  scholars is to continue pushing toward that decentered frame in Black studies, to
                  use
                  technology as a means of substantively collaborating and sharing resources with
                  colleagues situated outside of the U.S., and to advocate for multilinguality and
                  translation. Only in so doing can we hope to create Afro-diasporic systems of knowledge
                  production in the digital humanities that reflect inclusively humanist interests and
                  values, highlight diverse contributions, and nourish the widest range of dreams.</div>
