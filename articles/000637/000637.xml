         <p>Consistent with my recent reflections on the work – the material labor – of <ref
               target="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5749/j.ctv1kchp41.22?seq=1">dreaming in
               digital</ref>,<note> I refer here to my co-authored chapter, <title rend="quotes">On
                  the Interpretation of Caribbean Digital Dreams,</title> for the volume <title
                  rend="italic">The Digital Black Atlantic</title>, Roopika Risam and Kelly Baker
               Josephs, eds. (Minneapolis, MN: University of Minnesota Press, 2021: 225-35). In this
               essay, my co-author Alex Gil and I discuss the experience of collaborating across the
               humanist-technologist divide, paying particular attention to the material costs – the
               human and capital resources – that are too-often hidden to the view of members of the
               professoriate taking their first steps into digital scholarship.</note> I want to
            focus here on possibility. Like many before me, I began working at the intersection of
            the humanities and technology from a place of optimistic anticipation. The phrase <quote
               rend="inline">the affordances of the digital</quote> tripped lightly over my tongue
            and the opportunities for differently ordering – for expanding – my intellectual world
            at first appeared endless. But then, of course (and also like many before me), I quickly
            came to recognize the perils of wading naively into the waters of DH, the relative ease
            with which the very hierarchies and exclusions that have long underpinned analog
            scholarship are reiterated in the digital realm. </p>
         <p>As a researcher in the field of Caribbean studies with particular grounding in
            francophone literature and culture, my forays into the digital have been largely
            site-specific. They reflect, accompany, and emerge from the preoccupations that inform
            my traditional research and teaching – the monographs and articles I have published, the
            courses I have designed over the last two decades. I have been committed to the
            persistent unsettling of centers and margins – those that determine the parameters of
            belonging within the academy as the principal site of knowledge production and
            circulation, and those that make or deny space along explicitly and implicitly
            racialized lines. While thinking within this frame has meant contesting the university’s
            foundational Eurocentricity, I have in fact been most interested in querying the forms
            of intramural border-drawing that persist within the field of Black studies – notably,
            the tendency to position of US-American blackness as stand-in for the global Black
            experience, and the not-unrelated phenomenon of Anglophone monolinguality.</p>
         <p>Thus, when I think about ideal futures for Black studies and the digital humanities, and
            about the ways I might contribute to crafting those futures, I think primarily from the
            space of the Afro-Americas. This is certainly not to suggest that shifting focus from
            the US-American space to the Caribbean archipelago would on its own constitute an ideal.
            Rather, it is to express my hope that thinking the Caribbean idiosyncratically in my
            digital work can contribute to widening and nuancing understandings of “blackness” in
            the hemispheric Americas and beyond. This has entailed relying on Caribbean
            epistemologies to build digital products: that is, keeping front of mind Martinican
            writer-intellectual Edouard Glissant’s interconnected term-concepts
               <term>opacity,</term>
            <term>relation,</term> and <term>rhizomatic thinking</term>; Jamaican
            writer-intellectual Sylvia Wynter’s call to embrace oppositional forms of life – plots
            that challenge the plantation order; and Barbadian writer-intellectual Kamau
            Brathwaite's very notion of the archipelago as space of <soCalled>submarine
               unity</soCalled> – among other modes of thinking community in the shadow of empire,
            of naming and interrogating phenotypical and class diversity among racialized beings. </p>
         <p>It has also meant working to develop the mechanisms we need as Caribbeanists in order to
            be in conversation despite the linguistic and disciplinary silos that in many ways
            constrain Black participation in the academy. It has meant exploiting the
               <soCalled>shine</soCalled> of DH to direct resources and to accord deserved prestige
            to colleagues and communities that are crucial to but rarely enjoy the privileges of the
            work being done in North Atlantic institutions. </p>
         <p>My efforts to address these concerns – to make resources <q>reach</q> into Caribbean
            spaces – are reflected in the various initiatives my collaborators and I have worked to
            build, sustain, and grow in the last decades.<note> Alex Gil and Kelly Baker Josephs
               have been my primary collaborators since my very first forays in to digital
               scholarship. Every one of the projects named below has been realized in partnership
               with one of both of these scholars.</note> Leveraging, yes, the affordances of the
            digital, we have created platforms for both collaboration and accreditation among
            Caribbeanist DHers: an annual hybrid international conference devoted to collectively
            examining and amplifying digital Caribbean theory and praxis; an online peer-reviewed
            journal that showcases the extraordinary work produced within this community of scholars
            and practitioners of the digital; and a set of mapping visualizations designed to
            facilitate understandings of the Caribbean within a global frame, among else. </p>
         <p>The annual conference, <ref target="http://caribbeandigitalnyc.net/2021/">The Caribbean
               Digital</ref>,<note> http://caribbeandigitalnyc.net/2021/</note> is an international
            event hosted annually at locations in the United States and the Caribbean since 2014.
            This event has created a singular and consistent space of exchange for Caribbeanist
            digital scholars, consisting of traditional panels, roundtable conversations,
            skills-building workshops, and project show-and-tells. The work done in preparation for
            this gathering and/or produced in its wake has led to the publication of more than 30
            peer-reviewed scholarly articles and digital projects as well as to the development of
            several ongoing digital artifacts, including a collectively generated <ref

            <note> https://archipelagosjournal.org/</note> is a born-digital, peer-reviewed
            publication created in 2016 to “discern the ways in which the digital may enhance and
            transform our comprehension of the regional and diasporic Caribbean.” We created this
            platform both as a space for theorists and practitioners of the Caribbean digital to
            produce and share knowledge, and as a peer-review model that ensures the recognition and
            reward of this scholarship by the profession. Fully open access and infrastructurally
            lightweight, the journal was designed with sustainability of all sorts in mind.</p>
         <p>Our most recent project, the cartographic digital visualization <ref
               target="http://sameboats.org">
               <title rend="italic">In the Same Boats</title>
            </ref>,<note> http://sameboats.org</note> takes up the challenge of scholarly
            communication across the nation-language borders that are the legacies of European
            empire. It offers a series of individual maps built on a common template to produce a
            synthesizing illustration of the connections undergirding Black knowledge production
            from the twentieth century to the present. <emph>Same Boats</emph> lowers the barrier to
            entry for <soCalled>digi-curious</soCalled> Caribbeanists and other scholars of the
            African diaspora; to participate in this digital (ad)venture requires only the ability
            to enter data into a spreadsheet. Moreover, and as with all of our projects, it is open
            access and the back-end is transparent, its code on offer to any who would ask.</p>
         <p>I think of these platforms as so many invitations extended to a widely dispersed and
            unevenly resourced Caribbeanist intellectual community. They are meant to provide sites
            of exchange less bound by the logistical, bureaucratic, and financial demands of
            physical displacement. All of these projects have made use where possible of minimal
            computing, so to be maximally accessible to communities of scholars working outside of
            well-resourced institutions or in contexts where infrastructural support (electricity,
            stable internet service) is less reliable. All of them have welcomed contributions from
            all the languages of the Caribbean. Most recently, we have sought and been awarded
            significant <ref
               target="https://barnard.edu/news/barnard-college-receives-5m-grant-andrew-w-mellon-foundation"
               >funding</ref><note>
               https://barnard.edu/news/barnard-college-receives-5m-grant-andrew-w-mellon-foundation</note>,
            making it possible not only for us to subsidize costs for community members seeking to
            participate in events involving travel, and to provide translation for our published
            content and interpretation for our in-person gathering, but also to directly distribute
            resources through sub-awards to Caribbean institutions and a micro-granting program. </p>
         <p>There are, of course, aspects of our Caribbean digital futures that are still hindered
            by contemporary imperialist realities. The United States remains the magnetic center of
            the Americas. As such, even the most progressive scholarly pursuits – be they digital or
            analog – are conditioned by a North Atlantic frame that tends to think blackness,
            linguistically, in English and, culturally, as a minority identity. If we shift the
            frame south into the Caribbean and Latin America, however, vastly different expressions
            and experiences of blackness become legible. Our challenge as Caribbeanist digital
            scholars is to continue pushing toward that decentered frame in Black studies, to use
            technology as a means of substantively collaborating and sharing resources with
            colleagues situated outside of the U.S., and to advocate for multilinguality and
            translation. Only in so doing can we hope to create Afro-diasporic systems of knowledge
            production in the digital humanities that reflect inclusively humanist interests and
            values, highlight diverse contributions, and nourish the widest range of dreams.</p>
