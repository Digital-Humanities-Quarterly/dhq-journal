		<h1>Peer Reviewing for DHQ</h1>
		<p>DHQ deeply appreciates the contribution of effort from our volunteer peer reviewers,
			which makes the journal's work possible! We welcome peer reviewers with varied
			backgrounds and levels of expertise. As an open-access journal, DHQ anticipates a wide
			audience across the subfields of digital humanities and including readers from other
			domains. In addition to ensuring the intellectual quality of DHQ's publications, peer
			reviewers provide essential feedback to authors to help them make their work more
			legible to that audience. To review for DHQ, you must:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Have expertise in some area of digital humanities research or praxis</li>
			<li>Follow DHQ's <a href="#reviewer_guidelines">guidelines for reviewers</a></li>
			<li>Commit to responding to review requests in a timely manner (even if only to decline
				the request)</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 id="process">Peer Review Process</h2>
		<p>All DHQ submissions are reviewed internally to determine whether they are appropriate for the journal and ready for full consideration. Articles that meet these criteria are sent for external peer review.</p>
		<p>Requests are sent to reviewers with the option to accept or decline the request. In order to ensure a timely review, we ask reviewers to either accept or decline the request promptly, and to accept the request only if they are able to complete it within the requested window (typically 4 weeks).</p>
		<p>Reviewers provide their review via OJS, using the DHQ peer review form. Reviewers should provide substantive responses to all of the prompts. (Read <a href="peerReviewForm.txt">a copy of the form</a>.)</p>
		<p>DHQ's peer review is blind but not double-blind. The primary goal of the review process is to assist authors in improving their submissions, and to play an advisory role, rather than act as a gatekeeper. As a result, concealing the author's identity from reviewers is not essential for DHQ. We permit authors to anonymize their submissions if they choose. Regardless of whether the author's identity is revealed, or inferrable from context, we expect our reviewers to provide an assessment of the article's quality without influence from personal motivations or attachments. In cases of a genuine conflict of interest that makes unbiased and constructive review impossible, reviewers should notify DHQ and decline the review request. Please contact the editors if you have questions or concerns.</p>
