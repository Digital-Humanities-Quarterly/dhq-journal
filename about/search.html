        <h1>Search Help</h1>
        <p>The default search is a Boolean AND: the search will retrieve items containing all of the search terms. A Boolean OR search may be obtained by placing
            OR between the search terms (see example below). To search for a phrase, enclose the phrase within quotation marks; phrases may be used like individual
            words within a Boolean construction (see example below). Note that Boolean AND and OR operators must be capitalized.
        </p>
        <p>
            A plus sign (+) preceding a search term indicates that this term is required; a minus sign (-) indicates that items including this term should be omitted
            from the search results. These operators may be combined within a single search as in the example below.
