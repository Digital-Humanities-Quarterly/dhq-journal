         <h2>DHQ Community Statement</h2>
        <p>Digital Humanities Quarterly (DHQ) is committed to fostering the growth of a digital humanities that is inclusive, global, and equitable. The future of digital humanities is open, creative, and welcoming of a broad range of methods, content, and practitioners. DHQ seeks to build a community of research and practice that is diverse and international. As such, the journal stands in opposition to oppression and discrimination based on race, ethnicity, caste, gender identity, sexual identity, religion, ability, and other identity markers. In line with DHQ’s broader commitment to achieving social change and social justice within the field of digital humanities, we recognize the importance of affirming our support for all marginalized communities and seek to actualize institutional changes and new paths in academic and cultural heritage work. We welcome suggestions from the community on additional steps the journal could take. </p>
    	<p>To help build towards this future, DHQ is undertaking active steps which include:</p> 
<ul>
<li>Publishing a special issue at least every other year on a topic explicitly related to race and its relationship to additional axes of oppression, including gender, sexuality, disability, nationality, and language. Please see our recent issue on <a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/16/3/index.html">Black DH in the Rising Generation</a>. </li>
	<li>Formalizing a policy of immediate updates to authorial pronouns and names on previous publications at author request. Please email us at <a href="mailto:dhqinfo@digitalhumanities.org">dhqinfo@digitalhumanities.org</a> if you would like to change this information.
</li>
	<li>Updating our site’s design and functionalities to be accessible and compliant with WCAG: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. To move towards this goal, we’re recruiting an Accessibility Editor. We will be releasing a call for this position soon.</li>
	<li>Gathering feedback from the DH community on our efforts and where we can improve via periodic surveys from the Communications and Outreach Team.</li>
	<li>Hosting outreach and mentorship events like the DHQ Author Workshop where potential authors can meet DHQ Editors to learn more about the publication and submission process. Video records of author workshops are available at our <a href="../submissions/author_support.html">Author Support page</a>.
</li>
	<li>Inviting special issues on intersectional identities in DH space. We encourage special issues and on topics which have been historically invisibilized or silenced to build towards a DH future that is inclusive. Please see our <a href="../submissions/specialIssuesGuidelines.html">guidelines on submitting special issue proposals</a>.</li>
	<li>Recruiting a robust editorial team that more accurately reflects the diversity and global character of the DH community. Please <a href="../people/people.html">meet our team here</a>.</li>  </ul>

        <h2 id="dighum">DHQ on Digital Humanities</h2>
        <p>Digital humanities is a diverse and still emerging field that encompasses the practice of
            humanities research in and through information technology, and the exploration of how
            the humanities may evolve through their engagement with technology, media, and
            computational methods. DHQ seeks to provide a forum where practitioners, theorists,
            researchers, and teachers in this field can share their work with each other and with
            those from related disciplines. In identifying the scope of DHQ, we define both
            &quot;the humanities&quot; and &quot;the digital&quot; quite broadly,
            and we invite contributions that probe the boundaries of the domain or re-examine its
            foundational premises. If you're unsure of whether a prospective submission falls within
            DHQ's rubric, please <a href="mailto:editors@digitalhumanities.org">contact the
            editors</a>.</p>
        <h2 id="publishing">Publishing Policies</h2>
        <p>All DHQ materials are published under an open-access license that gives authors permanent ownership of their work. By default, DHQ publishes all content under a CC-BY-ND license, but authors may also specify a more permissive license (either CC-BY or CC0). DHQ retains a perpetual, non-exclusive right to publish the work and to include it in other aggregations and indexes to achieve broader impact and visibility. Authors are free to republish their work in any venue they choose. Authors do not need DHQ's permission to reuse or reprint their work in any form. Authors are also free (and encouraged) to deposit a copy of their article in an institutional or disciplinary repository. DHQ does not charge any fees of any kind.</p>
        <p>DHQ maintains a <a href="ethics_code.html">Code of Ethics</a> by which the journal is conducted.</p>
        <h2 id="technical">Technical Overview</h2>
        <p>DHQ is published on the web using an open-source XML-based publication system. We
            accept submissions in a wide range of formats, and host all accepted submissions that do not require
            dedicated software on the server, while providing links to any that do. Submissions in
            traditional academic formats (essays, articles, book reviews, bibliographies and so
            forth) are encoded in a TEI-compatible format for longevity and ease of management, but
            we also welcome innovative and experimental forms of scholarship and criticism. In
            addition, our web platform will support the infrastructure for ongoing 
            commenting on DHQ publications, ad hoc reviews of the literature, and the like. Our
            intent is to demonstrate and promulgate best practices in electronic text encoding
            conducive to long-term preservation and Internet-wide access, while simultaneously
            encouraging approaches that continue to push the boundaries of the possible.</p>
