         <h2>DHQ Statement on Black Lives Matter and Structural Racism</h2>
        <p>With the <a href="https://ach.org/ach-statement-on-black-lives-matter-structural-racism-and-our-organization/">Association for Computers and the Humanities</a>, Digital Humanities Quarterly stands in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement, and seeks to oppose systemic racism. We recognize the crucial role academic journals play in shaping perceptions about what research topics, methods, and authors are important, and in creating a visible profile of the fields they cover. DHQ recognizes that an academic journal must take active steps to achieve social change and social justice, and to make the field of digital humanities visible as a space for racial and gender equity. DHQ has not done enough in the past to recruit, support, and center the work of scholars of color. As part of ACH’s planned review of policies and organizational culture, DHQ commits to taking action based on that review. In addition, in DHQ’s already planned review and update of its editorial boards and policies in the coming year, we will focus on correcting the journal’s racial imbalance in both its editorial personnel and its publications. Finally, DHQ commits to a special issue at least every other year on a topic explicitly related to race and its relationship to additional axes of oppression, including gender, sexuality, disability, nationality, and language. A special issue on race in the rising DH generation is already under way. We welcome suggestions from the community on additional steps the journal could take.</p>

DHQ does not currently have Clarivate Analytics Impact Factor, although being part of this index moves us further in that direction. DHQ is also indexed in Google Scholar.

        <h2 id="dighum">DHQ on Digital Humanities</h2>
        <p>Digital humanities is a diverse and still emerging field that encompasses the practice of
            humanities research in and through information technology, and the exploration of how
            the humanities may evolve through their engagement with technology, media, and
            computational methods. DHQ seeks to provide a forum where practitioners, theorists,
            researchers, and teachers in this field can share their work with each other and with
            those from related disciplines. In identifying the scope of DHQ, we define both
            &quot;the humanities&quot; and &quot;the digital&quot; quite broadly,
            and we invite contributions that probe the boundaries of the domain or re-examine its
            foundational premises. If you're unsure of whether a prospective submission falls within
            DHQ's rubric, please <a href="mailto:editors@digitalhumanities.org">contact the
            editors</a>.</p>
        <h2 id="publishing">Publishing Policies</h2>
        <p>All DHQ materials are published under an open-access license that gives authors permanent ownership of their work. By default, DHQ publishes all content under a CC-BY-ND license, but authors may also specify a more permissive license (either CC-BY or CC0). DHQ retains a perpetual, non-exclusive right to publish the work and to include it in other aggregations and indexes to achieve broader impact and visibility. Authors are free to republish their work in any venue they choose. Authors do not need DHQ's permission to reuse or reprint their work in any form. Authors are also free (and encouraged) to deposit a copy of their article in an institutional or disciplinary repository. DHQ does not charge any fees of any kind.</p>
        <p>DHQ maintains a <a href="ethics_code.html">Code of Ethics</a> by which the journal is conducted.</p>
        <h2 id="technical">Technical Overview</h2>
        <p>DHQ is published on the web using an open-source XML-based publication system. We
            accept submissions in a wide range of formats, and host all accepted submissions that do not require
            dedicated software on the server, while providing links to any that do. Submissions in
            traditional academic formats (essays, articles, book reviews, bibliographies and so
            forth) are encoded in a TEI-compatible format for longevity and ease of management, but
            we also welcome innovative and experimental forms of scholarship and criticism. In
            addition, our web platform will support the infrastructure for ongoing 
            commenting on DHQ publications, ad hoc reviews of the literature, and the like. Our
            intent is to demonstrate and promulgate best practices in electronic text encoding
            conducive to long-term preservation and Internet-wide access, while simultaneously
            encouraging approaches that continue to push the boundaries of the possible.</p>
