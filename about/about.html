         <h2 id="scope">Scope of the Journal</h2>        
        <p>Digital humanities is a diverse and evolving field that encompasses the practice of
            humanities research in and through information technology, and the exploration of how
            the humanities may evolve through their engagement with technology, media, and
            computational methods. DHQ seeks to provide an interdisciplinary forum where practitioners, theorists,
            researchers, and teachers in this field can share their work with each other and with
            those from related disciplines. </p>
            <p>DHQ seeks to publish articles that enable researchers and practitioners in different subfields of digital humanities to learn from one another. As a result, our focus is primarily on articles that focus critical attention on their own methods and approaches, and that communicate clearly and engagingly about the goals, context, situational factors, design considerations, and other factors that may help a reader apply the research to their own work and understand its relevance. Routine applications of well-established tools, and highly specialized articles that do not articulate their broader relevance, are less likely to be a good fit.</p>
            
    	<p>DHQ does not typically publish the following:</p>
    	<ul>
    		<li>Bibliometric studies and literature reviews</li>
    		<li>Opinion pieces and articles that are purely speculative</li>
    		<li>Articles that describe a routine application of a well-understood tool or method to a specific humanities research task</li>
    		<li>Articles that are primarily focused on literary or historical interpretation, with only brief or superficial reference to digital tools and methods.</li>
    	</ul>
    	<p>If you're unsure of whether a prospective submission falls within
            DHQ's rubric, please <a href="mailto:editors@digitalhumanities.org">contact the
            editors</a>.</p>
    	
    	
    	
    	
    	
    	
        <h2 id="publishing">Publishing Policies</h2>
        <p>All DHQ materials are published under an open-access license that gives authors permanent ownership of their work. By default, DHQ publishes all content under a CC-BY-ND license, but authors may also specify a more permissive license (either CC-BY or CC0). DHQ retains a perpetual, non-exclusive right to publish the work and to include it in other aggregations and indexes to achieve broader impact and visibility. Authors are free to republish their work in any venue they choose. Authors do not need DHQ's permission to reuse or reprint their work in any form. Authors are also free (and encouraged) to deposit a copy of their article in an institutional or disciplinary repository. DHQ does not charge any fees of any kind.</p>
        <p>DHQ maintains a <a href="ethics_code.html">Code of Ethics</a> by which the journal is conducted.</p>
       
    	<h2 id="technical">Technical Overview</h2>
        <p>DHQ is published on the web using an open-source XML-based publication system. We
            accept submissions in a wide range of formats, and host all accepted submissions that do not require
            dedicated software on the server, while providing links to any that do. Submissions in
            traditional academic formats (essays, articles, book reviews, bibliographies and so
            forth) are encoded in a TEI-compatible format for longevity and ease of management, but
            we also welcome innovative and experimental forms of scholarship and criticism. In
            addition, our web platform will support the infrastructure for ongoing 
            commenting on DHQ publications, ad hoc reviews of the literature, and the like. Our
            intent is to demonstrate and promulgate best practices in electronic text encoding
            conducive to long-term preservation and Internet-wide access, while simultaneously
            encouraging approaches that continue to push the boundaries of the possible.</p>
