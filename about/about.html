         <div><h2 id="scope">Scope of the Journal</h2>        
        <p>Digital humanities is a diverse and evolving field that encompasses the practice of
            humanities research in and through information technology, and the exploration of how
            the humanities may evolve through their engagement with technology, media, and
            computational methods. DHQ seeks to provide an interdisciplinary forum where practitioners, theorists,
            researchers, and teachers in this field can share their work with each other and with
            those from related disciplines. </p>
            <p>DHQ seeks to publish articles that enable researchers and practitioners in different subfields of digital humanities to learn from one another. As a result, our focus is primarily on articles that focus critical attention on their own methods and approaches, and that communicate clearly and engagingly about the goals, context, situational factors, design considerations, and other factors that may help a reader apply the research to their own work and understand its relevance. Routine applications of well-established tools, and highly specialized articles that do not articulate their broader relevance, are less likely to be a good fit.</p>
            
    	<p>DHQ does not typically publish the following:</p>
    	<ul>
    		<li>Bibliometric studies and literature reviews</li>
    		<li>Opinion pieces and articles that are purely speculative</li>
    		<li>Articles that describe a routine application of a well-understood tool or method to a specific humanities research task</li>
    		<li>Articles that are primarily focused on literary or historical interpretation, with only brief or superficial reference to digital tools and methods.</li>
    	</ul>
    	<p>If you're unsure of whether a prospective submission falls within
            DHQ's rubric, please <a href="mailto:editors@digitalhumanities.org">contact the
            editors</a>.</p>
