         <h2>DHQ Community Statement</h2>
        <p>Digital Humanities Quarterly (DHQ) is committed to fostering the growth of a digital humanities that is inclusive, global, and equitable. The future of digital humanities is open, creative, and welcoming of a broad range of methods, content, and practitioners. DHQ seeks to build a community of research and practice that is diverse and international. As such, the journal stands in opposition to oppression and discrimination based on race, ethnicity, caste, gender identity, sexual identity, religion, ability, and other identity markers. In line with DHQ’s broader commitment to achieving social change and social justice within the field of digital humanities, we recognize the importance of affirming our support for all marginalized communities and seek to actualize institutional changes and new paths in academic and cultural heritage work. We welcome suggestions from the community on additional steps the journal could take. </p>
    	<p>To help build towards this future, DHQ is undertaking active steps which include:</p> 
<ul>
<li>Publishing a special issue at least every other year on a topic explicitly related to race and its relationship to additional axes of oppression, including gender, sexuality, disability, nationality, and language. </li>
	<li>Formalizing a policy of immediate updates to authorial pronouns and names on previous publications at author request. Please email us at <a href="mailto:dhqinfo@digitalhumanities.org">dhqinfo@digitalhumanities.org</a> if you would like to change this information.
</li>
	<li>Updating our site’s design and functionalities to be accessible and compliant with WCAG: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.</li>
	<li>Gathering feedback from the DH community on our efforts and where we can improve via periodic surveys from the Communications and Outreach Team.</li>
	<li>Hosting outreach and mentorship events like the DHQ Author Workshop where potential authors can meet DHQ Editors to learn more about the publication and submission process. Video records of author workshops are available at our <a href="../submissions/author_support.html">Author Support page</a>.
</li>
	<li>Inviting special issues on intersectional identities in DH space. We encourage special issues and on topics which have been historically invisibilized or silenced to build towards a DH future that is inclusive. Please see our <a href="../submissions/specialIssuesGuidelines.html">guidelines on submitting special issue proposals</a>.</li>
	<li>Recruiting a robust editorial team that more accurately reflects the diversity and global character of the DH community. Please <a href="../people/people.html">meet our team here</a>.</li>  </ul>
<p>We welcome feedback and suggestions about DHQ’s work. Please reach out to us at <a href="mailto:dhq-outreach@digitalhumanities.org">dhq-outreach@digitalhumanities.org</a> if you would like to get in touch. </p>
