        <title>DHQ Code of Ethics</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>DHQ Code of Ethics</h1>
        <p> DHQ is an open-access journal published by the Association for Computers and the
            Humanities and the Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations, both of which are
            international professional organizations with strong commitments to multiculturalism,
            diversity, and inclusion. DHQ takes publication ethics seriously, and is aware that
            traditional codes of ethical conduct for scholarly journals may need to be extended and
            reinterpreted in light of new digital methods and contexts for scholarly communication.
            DHQ deals with a diverse community of authors and recognizes that academic norms and
            practices are culturally specific. DHQ therefore seeks to identify potential excellence
            wherever it may be found and to help authors realize the potential of their work for the
            DHQ audience, rather than acting as a gatekeeper</p>

        <h2>DHQ Position on Impartiality and Diversity</h2>
        <p>DHQ operates all of its publication practices without discrimination against authors on
            the basis of race, gender, sexuality, nationality, academic or professional status, age,
            ability, or any other factor not pertaining to the quality of the submission. We
            periodically monitor these aspects of our submission and acceptance rates to gather
            information about whether and how factors within (or outside of) the journal’s control
            may be creating or reinforcing specific inequities.</p>
        <h2>DHQ Position on Plagiarism </h2>
        <p>DHQ maintains the highest level of academic quality, and that includes requiring that all
            research ideas be credited with integrity. All sources should be acknowledged using
            conventional academic citation practices. We take all accusations of plagiarism
            seriously. Allegations of plagiarism in a published article should be sent to the editor
            in chief (<a href="mailto:editors@digitalhumanities.org">editors@digitalhumanities.org</a>). DHQ will first contact the author and request
            an explanation, and if necessary will mediate a discussion between the author and the
            complainant. In cases of inadvertent plagiarism where the author was acting in good
            faith, a revised version of the article will be published that corrects the error. If
            DHQ determines that deliberate plagiarism has been committed, the author will be given
            the choice of withdrawing the article or of publishing a revised version with an
            acknowledgement and apology. If plagiarism is discovered during the review process, DHQ
            follows the procedures outlined by the <a href="http://publicationethics.org/files/plagiarism%20A.pdf">Committee on Publication Ethics</a>. (Please see complaint procedure,
            below). </p>
        <h2>DHQ Position on Peer Review</h2>
        <p>DHQ operates a double blind peer review procedure: the reviewing system does not reveal
            the identity of authors and reviewers to each other. However, DHQ does not take steps to
            anonymize the submissions themselves (e.g to redact names or other identifying
            references), although authors are free to do so. For this reason, given the close-knit
            nature of some domains within the DH community, in some cases reviewers may be able to
            guess the identity of the author(s). Peer review feedback is not treated as a vote for
            or against the submission, but rather as a contribution to an informed discussion of the
            submission’s merits, which is synthesized by the editorial team before making a decision
            about acceptance.</p>
        <p> Reviewers are chosen for their expertise by the editorial team. Conflicts of interest
            are identified and avoided both through monitoring by the editorial team, and in
            <a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/submissions/peerReviewing.html">instructions to reviewers</a>. We value peer
            review and our peer reviewers, and we strive to provide appropriate acknowledgement
            (e.g. via a certificate, if requested, for use in tenure files and other applications if
            necessary) within the constraints of the blind peer review process.</p>
        <h2> Internal conduct within DHQ</h2>
        <p>The <a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/people/people.html">DHQ Editorial Board</a>
            contributes input when requested in a timely way. The editorial board meets periodically
            to discuss all aspects of the journal’s performance, including the issues covered within
            this document. </p>
        <p> The General Editors of DHQ involve relevant parts of the team in decision-making, and
            communicate effectively. Decision making is done in a transparent manner, with
            information shared widely with relevant members of the team. </p>
        <p> We respect the contribution of time by peer reviewers and try not to overburden them
            with requests. Peer reviewers should strive to fulfill their reviewing commitments
            within the time frame set out by the editorial team. If a delay is unavoidable they will
            take steps to inform the managing editors so that another reviewer can be assigned if
            necessary.</p>
        <h2>DHQ Position on Fair Submission and Publication Process</h2>
        <p>DHQ makes every effort to provide authors with a timely process, within the constraints
            of our staffing and resources. This process is set out to authors when submissions are
            received to the journal. DHQ acts to ensure that there is no unfairness or favoritism in
            the submission or publication process: delay may be unavoidable but no submissions are
            given special privilege. Accidental delays are remedied as soon as possible.</p>
        <h2>DHQ Position on Mentoring</h2>
        <p>In keeping with its recognition of the diversity of academic norms and practices within
            global digital humanities, DHQ supports authors and provides mentoring to help bridge
            barriers of language, access, and training.</p>
        <h2>DHQ Position on Fair Credit and Collaboration</h2>
        <p>We encourage authors to provide equitable acknowledgement of research collaborators and
            contributors to projects that are the subject of DHQ articles. While it is up to the
            individual project as to whether contributors are named as co-authors or in the
            acknowledgements, we recommend the <a href="https://faircite.wordpress.com/">Faircite practices</a>
            of extending authorship credit to all team members who have worked on a project from
            which the research stems. </p>
        <h2>DHQ Position on Respectful Community</h2>
        <p>All communication between the DHQ editorial staff, authors, and reviewers is conducted in
            a spirit of respect and constructiveness. Any comment made on articles by any member of
            the DHQ community should be constructive. Abusive or derogatory statements are not
            tolerated. We provide specific <a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/submissions/peerReviewing.html">guidance to peer reviewers</a> on how to
            undertake effective reviews. Review language should be constructive and respectful. No
            demeaning or personal comments will be tolerated in peer review; they will be redacted
            from feedback to authors if they appear, and reviewers who repeatedly violate these
            guidelines will be removed from the reviewer pool. </p>
        <h2>DHQ Position on Hate speech and Defamation</h2>
        <p>DHQ does not publish pieces that discuss interpersonal grievances or violate
            confidentiality; DHQ is for public professional communication. </p>
        <p> DHQ does not publish pieces that contain or endorse hate speech or defamation, except as
            examples used to make an appropriate scholarly argument.</p>
        <p> DHQ does not publish pieces that contain potentially libellous or slanderous
            content.</p>
        <p> The Editorial Board of DHQ reserve the right to make judgements on whether content can
            be construed as hate speech, defamatory, libelous, slanderous, or otherwise problematic. </p>
        <h2>DHQ Position on Responsibility and Production Quality</h2>
        <p>DHQ is responsible for long-term curation and sustainability of the journal’s content.
            Should DHQ cease to publish, this responsibility reverts to ADHO. </p>
        <p> The DHQ editorial team are responsible for producing high quality of data, and for
            copyediting journal content. </p>
        <p> DHQ authors are responsible for the accuracy of their work, for crediting all sources
            adequately, for fairly including collaborators in author lists, acknowledgements, and
            the publishing process, and for final review and sign off of journal articles. DHQ does
            not have the resources to conduct systematic fact-checking. Authors are responsible for
            the content of their articles. </p>
        <p> DHQ authors are responsible for securing cultural and intellectual property permissions.
            DHQ expects authors to respect community cultural property traditions. Special care
            should be taken in cases involving indigenous communities.</p>
        <p> DHQ will fix errors in a timely fashion when they are reported to us, as described
            below, and we will undertake appropriate measures to discover and fix errors and
            inconsistencies in published work. DHQ also provides a mechanism (via commenting on
            individual articles) for community discussion of substantive points that are not simply
            matters of error.</p>
        <h2>DHQ Complaint Procedure</h2>
        <p>DHQ provides public mechanisms for making complaints and reporting errors and will
            respond via email in a timely fashion to any complaints concerning the journal,
            including content, data, publication ethics, etc., in a timely way. Both the journal and
            ADHO take all complaints seriously and encourage dialogue between readers, authors, and
            the editorial board when any aspect of behaviour or publication to DHQ is found not to
            maintain the standards set out in this document. Contact information is provided in a
            public facing manner on our website. Complaints should be made via email to the
